Smollett reveals real danger in jumping to conclusions

Jussie Smollett leaves George N Leighton Criminal Courthouse in Chicago Feb. 21. He allegedly staged an attack on himself because he wanted more money from “Empire,” the show in which he appears. If true, he has done a disservice to real victims of hate crimes. less Jussie Smollett leaves George N Leighton Criminal Courthouse in Chicago Feb. 21.

Whoever said there is no such thing as bad publicity never met Jussie Smollett.

Ask your HR director. There must be easier ways to get a salary bump.

In a dizzying turn of events, the star went from alleged victim to criminal defendant. The actor has now been arrested in Chicago and charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

If convicted, the actor could get one to three years in prison and face a $25,000 fine. And a story that could have helped shine a light on a rash of anti-LGBTQ violence in America will instead give those who are uncomfortable with the topic an excuse to stay in the dark.

I don’t see how we avoid it. There are too many stories. For instance, in a case that didn’t get a fraction of the attention given to the Smollett story, a gay couple was attacked and seriously injured by four men in Austin on Jan. 19 in an apparent hate crime. According to the police report, Spencer Deehring and Tristan Perry were beaten and kicked until unconscious.

If Smollett did indeed stage this attack on himself, then the actor did incalculable harm to victims of genuine hate crimes, and shame on him. But if anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable discussing LGBTQ issues is using this case as an easy out, then shame on them.

Let’s catch up. Smollett, a gay African-American actor who stars in the Fox drama “Empire,” claimed that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago on Jan 29. He said that two men who recognized him from the show cornered him in the middle of the night. He said they yelled slurs, hit him, doused him with bleach and put a noose around his neck — all while shouting, “This is MAGA country!”

A couple weeks later, police questioned two brothers from Nigeria, who told them that Smollett had hired them — at the bargain price of $3,500 — to stage the attack.

The stunt might have been phony, but the hatred it unleashed was real. A lot of it came from anti-Trumpers — some of whom are running for president. In fact, @CoryBooker and @KamalaHarris both tweeted that this was an “attempted modern-day lynching.”

Meanwhile, as this drama was unfolding, the audience got into the act — and tripped over its own feet. Many of those who tried to follow each bounce of this story immediately jumped to conclusions based on nothing more than their biases.

It happened on both the oversensitive left, and the desensitized right. Liberals went off half-cocked and suggested the alleged incident was fueled by the same mood that helped elect Donald Trump. Conservatives cynically used the alleged hoax as an excuse to bash “identity politics.”

If we wanted something to be true, it was true. If we wanted it to be false, it must be false. Why? Because this story wasn’t about Smollett. It was about us — about how we feel about anti-LGBTQ violence.

C’mon, people, how broken are we? We’ve gone from not listening to not thinking. We see a tweet or hear a rumor, and we decide — on the spot — whether or not it’s true based on our politics and our prejudices. Case closed.

Last month, when my brother — who happens to be gay, so his antennae are up for stories like this — texted me to share news of the alleged hate crime, I didn’t buy it. The journalist in me was skeptical that white racist homophobes who voted for Trump but also watched “Empire” were roaming the streets of a Democratic haven like Chicago.

But people kept talking about the story. So eventually, I mentioned the alleged attack in a column about how it is that so many LGBTQ stories are in the news these days. And I was careful to use the word “alleged.”

No matter. I still heard from readers who were eager to discount the whole column. Days before police arrested Smollett, they had already made up their minds that the alleged attack was a hoax. Like I said, we feel. We don’t think.

Never mind Jussie Smollett. The justice system will take care of him.

Who’s going to take care of fixing the rest of us?

“If you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman.”

Chicago needs to get some things done.

We also asked a woman to do that on Tuesday, when Lori Lightfoot — an African-American and openly gay woman — took the lead from an unprecedented pack of mayoral candidates that included 10 men.

And just to make sure we were heard, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, also an African-American female, snagged a run-off spot by besting Bill Daley, who was a presumed front-runner.

People from all over the country texted me, excited about the results of this city’s mayoral showdown.

These black women did more than secure a place in the city’s history; they redeemed a Black History Month that was hijacked by negative stories about famous black men accused of criminal behavior.

Instead of images of the disgraced “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett and accused pedophile R. Kelly dominating front pages, Chicagoans woke up to Lightfoot and Preckwinkle, delivering a much-needed dose of positive energy.

Breathe it in and savor it.

It won’t be long before the mud slinging begins. While I’m hopeful that change is on its way, this is still Chicago.

Where else could someone with a federal extortion case hanging over his head, as does Ald. Ed Burke (14th), wrack up a decisive win?

Were all those people who voted for Burke out of town when the feds raided his City Hall and ward offices? Did they not hear that another alderman, Danny Solis (25th), cooperated with the feds by wearing a wire to record damning evidence?

By the way, for all those folks who couldn’t make up their minds on Tuesday and didn’t vote at all, shame on you.

To their credit, the 14 mayoral candidates crisscrossed the city participating in mayoral forums to get their message out.

After a governor’s race that saw wealthy candidates pour $284 million into the campaign, Lightfoot’s upset proved that a political candidate doesn’t need the most money to win an election.

Lightfoot and Preckwinkle’s successful campaigns have paved the way for a season of leadership that we’ve never seen before.

Frankly, in a city where the black church holds sway over the vote as much as it does the collection plate, I didn’t see Lightfoot knocking Preckwinkle out of the top spot.

And when Smollett’s reported hate crime turned into an alleged hoax, I was concerned that it would turn off potential voters from supporting an openly gay candidate.

But Lightfoot did not limit her campaign to seeking the support of LGBT friendly communities.

Wearing her trademark chapeau, Lightfoot reached out to every neighborhood.

For instance, two weeks ago — while top mayoral candidates skipped a mayoral candidate forum that was hosted by a coalition of South Side organizations — Lightfoot showed up, shaking hands and mingling with the crowd.

Preckwinkle, a seasoned politician and boss of the Chicago Democratic Party — the first woman to hold that title — is not known for her fuzzy feelings.

Yet the former alderman and teacher, has an exceptionally compassionate heart when it comes to criminal justice reform and healthcare.

Ironically, these women are a lot alike in outward appearance.

Although one is petite and the other is tall, both prefer a natural, no-fuss look and regularly wear little or no make-up.

In fact, the criticism I heard most often about either woman didn’t have anything to do with their policies or even their record.

Some women didn’t like their blue suits.

“Why don’t they have a stylist or someone to help them pick out what to wear?” one woman groused.

While a lot of women were worrying about superficial things like make-up, hair, and the latest trendy fashions, these two women had bigger concerns.

As smart and as accomplished as these women are, they won’t be able to solve all our problems.

As my husband pointed out, the woman who wins the mayoral contest is likely to be the most hated person in the city when she has to make the tough decisions.

But for now, I’m going to relish the day.

Thank you, Lori.

Thank you, Toni.

You ladies rescued Black History Month."

Last week: Gov. Ron DeSantis says Common Core is done in Florida (although, as Scott Maxwell pointed out last week, Gov. Scott said the same thing six years ago). Florida's public schools have been mired in the lower half of the national rankings for years. Yes, Common Core has its problems. Getting rid of it may satisfy its critics, but that alone won't improve our schools or ensure our children are prepared for life in the 21st century. Having sensible educational standards, reasonable ways of measuring progress, and a supportive system for teachers and students seems obvious enough. Hopefully, our elected officials in Tallahassee will finally see the forest for the trees.

Looking ahead: Here's a surprise: the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously. The question was a challenge to civil forfeiture -- seizing personal property -- by states in criminal cases. The Supreme Court said states are subject to the same limits as the federal government, and specifically that the state of Indiana went too far in seizing the luxury car of a man who pleaded guilty. Florida has actually been ahead of the curve on this one: our legislature passed a law limiting civil forfeiture back in 2016. Good to know that, this time at least, a U.S. Supreme Court decision won't really have such dramatic impact on our state."

The usual suspects claim that this will close the “gun show loophole” and that “many who are legally barred from owning guns skip background checks by buying at gun shows or online.”

This week the House will vote to expand background checks to all gun purchases. Many who are legally barred from owning guns skip background checks by buying at gun shows or online. This is an easy bill to close a loophole and the Senate should pass it too. #LettersForChange — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) February 26, 2019

False. Unlike Jussie Smollett, folks who know they’re legally barred from owning a gun don’t like to leave a paper or internet trail leading to their purchase, so they don’t purchase guns online. Also, in case DiFi hasn’t heard, banks, merchant processors, and website hosting companies aren’t too keen on doing business with people who sell guns, especially online. In addition, when one purchases a gun online, it isn’t dropped at one’s door along with the Amazon Prime purchases. The firearm must be picked up by the actual purchaser from a Federal Firearms Licensee.

For example (arrows and highlighting added for ease of identification for those with the intellectual level of the average freshman House Democrat):

As has been covered ad nauseam in the past, there is no such thing as the “gun show loophole.” Any time a gun dealer, who must be an FFL, is involved in a transaction, a background check is performed. Unless gun shows are allowing private individuals to set up a booth as a merchant at a gun show (which would introduce them to a crazy amount of liability), the only people selling guns at gun shows are gun dealers. Therefore, people who make purchases at gun shows are subjected to the same background checks and waiting periods as people who purchase a gun at a retail store.

Simply put, prohibited people aren’t buying guns online or at gun shows or at retail stores. They’re buying them on the street, in cash (unless their prohibiting information hasn’t been transmitted to the NICS – as happened with the Charleston shooter and the Texas church shooter). Also, the NICS won’t catch someone with bad intent who hasn’t yet committed a crime.

So, background checks don’t keep guns out of the hands of prohibited people or those with bad intent, but the system does sometimes falsely flag innocent people as prohibited. In that case, innocent people are forced to hire an attorney and sue the FBI so before they can avail themselves of their constitutionally-protected right to armed self defense.

The bill also doesn’t specify how private parties are supposed to access the NICS, and will undoubtedly add a great deal of cost to any private transaction. It’s obvious that the aim here isn’t to keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill or violent people, but to keep guns out of everyone’s hands.

Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) explained the problems with this bill on his way to the vote.

Last year President Trump said he’d be strongly pushing “comprehensive” background checks.

But last week he threatened to veto both this bill and one mandating that gun dealers wait 10 days for the results of a background check before allowing purchasers to take possession of a firearm.

Valencia Love, 47, meet Kelly in September according to a family member, who said that the two were both guests on a local cruise around Lake Michigan.

Love had long been a fan of the singer, but after that meeting became 'obsessed' with Kelly said the family member, who asked not to be named.

That family member said it was a shock to learn however that Love had posted Kelly's bail, though she did reveal that the money was likely not much of a problem.

This is because love received a seven-figure settlement after filing a wrongful death lawsuit against then hospital that was treating her young daughter when she passed away in 2010.

Love on the Blu, the restaurant that Love owns, was also purchased with the money she made in the suit.

She bought the restaurant around the same time that she met Kelly according to records.

DailyMail.com revealed on Tuesday that Love also owns the Lord and Child Christian Daycare Center, but has been an executive there with one other women for well over a decade.

Records obtained by DailyMail.com show that Love also paid $350,000 for a property in a Romeoville tract housing development back in September.

Two years prior to receiving that settlement, Love had filed for both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

She has also taken out multiple orders of protection over the years.

Kelly appeared in a Chicago courtroom on Monday where his lawyer formally entered a not guilty plea on his behalf to 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

The singer, who wore an orange prison jumpsuit in court, identified himself to the judge at the start of the hearing, but did not speak again during the proceedings.

Once the hearing was over, Kelly returned to D. O. C. Division 8 RTU, with the singer still unable to cover his $1 million bond.

Hours later he was free, thanks to Love.

Kelly's lawyer, Steven Greenberg, responded to the charges with a statement over the weekend, saying: 'We haven't seen any evidence, any reason to believe these allegations are credible. He's a rock star. He doesn't need to have nonconsensual sex.'

Aggravated criminal sexual abuse is a Class 2 felony with a sentencing range of 3-7 years in prison. He faces up to 70 years behind bars if convicted.

These new charges come one week after the emergence of a rape tape that allegedly features Kelly and a minor.

And on Monday, lawyer Michael Avenatti stated that he is working to obtain new tapes that allegedly show Kelly with underage females.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx spoke about the charges at a brief press conference on Friday.

She went through the charges related to each of the four victims, using only initials to identify the women.

First was H.W., who was under the age of 17 between the dates of May 26, 1998 and May 25, 1999.

Kelly is charged with four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for the alleged offenses involving that victim.

Those include an instance of 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and H.W's sex organ,' an instance where the contact was with 'H.W's mouth' and when 'Robert Kelly touched his penis to H.W's breast.'

The fourth count stems from the claim that 'Robert Kelly touched his mouth to H.W's breast.

R.L. was involved in an incident which occurred between September 26, 1998 and September 25, 2001 when she was a minor.

That alleged incident resulted in two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse - one for 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and R.L's sex organ' one for contact with her 'mouth.'

The third victim L.C. was of the age of consent on February 18, 2003.

'A grand jury returned an indictment of one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse based on the transmission of semen by Robert Kelly upon any part of the body of the victim for the purpose of sexual gratification during the course of the underlying forcible felony of Attempt Criminal Sexual Assault,' said Foxx.

The fourth and final victim was identified as J.P., and the incidents she was involved in led to the final three sexual abuse charges against Kelly.

Those incidents took place between May 1, 2009 and January 31, 2010, and the victim was under the age of 17.

In that case there was 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and J.P's sex organ,' 'mouth' and 'the transmission of semen by Robert Kelly.'

Foxx had made a very public plea for accusers to come forward last month, and there could be more charges to come.

Kelly's indictment came one day after the Cook County State's Attorney's Office announced that Jussie Smollett had been indicted by a grand jury on a single charge of disorderly conduct for falsifying a police report.

The speed with which Smollett was indicted had led some to question why the State's Attorney's Office seemed to be taking their time with Kelly but rushing through the Smollett case.

Illinois is just one of the states where there is an open investigation into Kelly.

Lawyers for the Southern District of New York have also been meeting with alleged victims as well as agents from the IRS and FBI while the Department of Homeland Security has also opened up a probe.

This all comes in the wake of the Lifetime series Surviving R Kelly.

The six-part docuseries ended on a devastating note, with the parents of one of the young women who had run away with Kelly seen throwing rocks at his studio windows trying to get the attention of their daughter.

When they called Chicago police however, the members of law enforcement were not able to legally enter the property.

Kelly had yet to be hit with any criminal charges in the wake of the docuseries until Friday."

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett, is now out on bond just weeks after he reported an alleged assault and claiming it was a hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department investigated and found out that the actor actually orchestrated the assault himself.

Smollett’s story started to fall apart when he did an interview on ABC news, during which his mannerisms seemed off and his words came out sounding like lines he’d rehearsed for his next scene.

His attitude even seemed to flare up when interviewers brought up accusations about the assault being made up.

Something else that stood out was that when asked about his refusal to release his phone to authorities, he claimed he didn’t because of private pictures, videos, numbers, etc. contained within the device.

Smollett acknowledges that hate crimes are a serious on going issue in America, and is very passionate about speaking against them especially because he has experienced them first hand as an openly gay, black man.

However, Smollett shouldn’t have staged such a racially charged and homophobic hate crime to raise awareness as that can actually do more harm than good.

Stages crimes like this will give people a reason to dismiss future claims of similar crimes because they’ll be able to say, “Well what if it’s fake?”

Smollett himself doesn’t have to have racial slurs hurled at him, a noose used on him, or bleached poured on him to show that these things can happen.

He could have just as easily have brought attention to these types of crimes by speaking up about actual victims instead.

Furthermore, he decided to stage this assault during black history month.

We could give him the benefit of the doubt this his intention could have been to shed light on the fact that black people have been the most frequent victims too hate crimes.

However, as stated before, there could have been better ways of going about bringing awareness to these issues.

It is important for people to realize incidents like this can and really do happen, but a lot of people who experience the hate crimes do not report it.

It is imperative to speak out and let it be known that bias motivated incidents and crimes will not be tolerated and always need to be reported to police enforcement.

You don’t have to pull a Jussie Smollett to raise awareness, but change does start with you.

Speak up. Don’t let these crimes go unpunished."

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

RELATED: Minneapolis Police Chief Can’t Release George Floyd Bodycam + He’s Fighting with Police Union on Reform

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Law enforcement officials charged 19-year-old Ryan M. Salvagno of Somerset, New Jersey with assault (a disorderly person’s offense) and harassment (a petty disorderly person’s offense), according to a press release. Charges were filed in the Franklin Township Municipal Court. (RELATED: Woman Assaulted Man Wearing MAGA Hat. Now ICE Is Looking To Send Her Packing)

The victim, whom authorities did not identify, was exiting a grocery store on Monday afternoon when the man later identified as Salvagno confronted him about his MAGA hat, the Somerset County Prosecutor’s office also said in the press release.

Following a “brief verbal confrontation,” the victim attempted to leave.

As he turned to walk away, defendant Salvagno reportedly grabbed the victim’s hat, and struggle for possession of the hat ensued. (RELATED: Jussie Smollett On MAGA Hats: ‘I Never Said That!’)

Following the struggle over the hat, Salvagno “took the victim by the arm and threw him to the ground, tipping over the victim’s cart of groceries and ultimately throwing the hat to the side,” the press release explained.

Somerset Prosecutor Michael H. Robertson reported that the Franklin Township Police Department, on arrival, found the victim suffering from “minor injuries.”

A previous press release from the prosecutor’s office indicated that the man declined medical attention.

Salvago is slated for arraignment on Mar. 14, 2019."

""We must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day,"" the actress writes.

Ellen Page is making it clear hate crimes are still a reality in America.

The ""Umbrella Academy"" star wrote an op-ed for The Hollywood Reporter in an effort to refocus media attention on the real threats and hate crimes underrepresented communities face every day, following disturbing developments in Jussie Smollett's case.

In the essay, which was published Wednesday, Page, who was one of the first to publically voice support for Smollett after the reported crime, said she had ""no reason to doubt"" the ""Empire"" star in the beginning. However, since the police investigation now points in the direction of a hoax, Page fears real victims might be ""more reluctant"" to come forward.

""We, as LGBTQ+ people, are forced to fear for our safety because instances of hate violence,"" she wrote. ""It's the fear that makes us pause before grabbing the hand of our loved one in public. It's the fear that makes us consider whether or not we are in physical danger before we lean in for a kiss on the cheek. The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath. I had no reason to doubt Jussie.""

""My work on Gaycation -- the docuseries I produced to chronicle LGBTQ+ stories from around the world -- introduced me to many survivors of hate violence,"" she continued. ""I know how prevalent and pernicious it can be. If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes.""

""We must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day.""

""The Juno"" star then offered a plea: ""I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists. The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told.""

Page also presented harrowing statistics, including FBI data released in 2018 that said hate crimes in America rose 17 percent compared to the year prior.

""No child, no teenager, no adult -- no one deserves to be victimized because of who they are,"" she concluded. ""No one should feel shame for who they were born to be or to live their life in fear. I am going to use my voice and visibility to continue speaking and -- as storytellers and members of an industry with a global platform -- I implore you to join me."""

He detailed a story of corruption, greed and — what we already know — racism. In a bizarre move, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows pulled out Lynne Patton, who is reportedly Eric Trump‘s former party planner, to prove 45 could not be racist.

Meadows babbled,“Lynne Patton says she would not work for a man who is racist… She disagrees with you. She says as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, that there is no way that she would work for an individual who was a racist.” Meadows, who somehow believes Patton represents all African Americans, asked, “How do you reconcile the two of those?”

As Patton silently stood behind Meadows, willingly debasing herself even more than she already has being part of the Trump administration, Cohen said, “Ask Ms. Patton how many Black people are executives at the Trump Organization? The answer is zero.”

Watch below:

During Cohen’s opening remarks he said about Trump, “He is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries ‘shitholes.’ In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn’t a ‘shithole.’ This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States.”

He continued, “While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only Black people could live that way. And, he told me that Black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.”

Patton clearly doesn’t care. In January of last year, she attacked another Black woman, April Ryan, calling her Miss Piggy:

She already hasn’t gotten a good response.

“Who the hell is Lynne Patton? Anything from Trump I don’t trust. I don’t think she wants to help,” said Carline Campbell, a 20-year resident of the Patterson Houses in the Bronx, where Patton was expected to stay first, according to the New York Daily News.

HUD employees were confused by Patton’s appearance. The Washington Post reports, “Lynne Patton’s appearance during the hearing confused HUD employees, who were expecting her to show up to work Wednesday.”

Joly is a noted transgender activist in his community who had worked for the American Red Cross, served as director of the Jackson Pride Center and had recently helped organize a local pride march before the blaze.

AD

The police investigation led them to a different conclusion. About a year after the house burned down, prosecutors charged Joly with first-degree arson.

AD

The case has recently gained more attention after charges were filed against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who has been accused by police of faking a hate crime to increase his profile. The two cases are being linked in some news reports because of the LGBT identities of the accused and the accusations leveled against them.

Joly, whose lawyer said he is innocent, will appear in court next week as his defense files a motion to suppress evidence.

A police report obtained by MLive.com in 2018 lays out numerous pieces of evidence against Joly. A neighbor who spoke to Joly that day said he smelled of gasoline. Security cameras captured him filling a gas can at Marathon gas station that day, and cellphone records indicate Joly briefly returned to the house just before 911 calls about a fire at the house. As firefighters responded to the blaze, they noticed fires continued to ignite after being extinguished, a sign that an accelerant was present, and a police dog later detected gasoline in several areas of the home.

AD

AD

The report also says Joly was in the process of purchasing the house from its owner through a land contract but did not own the home.

The timing of the fire had raised concerns among supporters of the couple, who are now married. “He knows that he is a target. And that is a hard way to live,” his friend Kim Cwynar said in 2017. “And yet, he perseveres, every single day. Stepping up to the plate, standing up for others, speaking up for others.”

Now, some members of the local community are frustrated with Joly.

“It’s embarrassing,” Travis Trombley, a gay resident, told the Detroit News. “How do you do it to the community you have put so much effort into helping?”

AD

But police, prosecutors and Joly’s attorney say hate crimes did not play a significant role in the case, and that Joly did not claim he had been the victim of one.

AD

""Within a relatively short period of time, the FBI found it wasn’t a hate crime,” Jackson County prosecutor Jerard M. Jarzynka told The Washington Post. “Our prosecution theory is that it was not a hate crime, it was an arson case and animal cruelty case.”

Joly’s lawyer Andrew Abood claims “the prosecutor is trying to make a case when one does not exist.”

“When you look at the proof that’s been put out, it was more coincidence than anything else,” he said. “And there was clearly an absence of motive on the part of my client.""

Failure to require parental consent has cost TikTok a record multi-million dollar fine with the Federal Trade Commission.

TikTok is not safe for your child.

That’s according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), at least.

TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, has agreed to pay the federal agency a record $5.7 million fine.

Filed by the Department of Justice, the FTC alleges Musical.ly – the app’s former brand name – violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). In the United States, developers or websites targeted at children under 13 must require parental consent to share personal information.

TikTok/Musical.ly’s failure to do so led to the record multimillion dollar fine.

In the US, social networks and online websites ask users to agree to a Terms of Service. A specific clause prohibits children under 13 from using an app, website, or online network without their parent’s permission.

According to the FTC, most Musical.ly users were under 13. The federal agency had received “thousands of complaints from parents that their children under 13 had created Musical.ly accounts.”

Speaking about the violation, Joe Simons, Chairman of the FTC, explained,

“The operators of Musical.ly — now known as TikTok — knew many children were using the app but they still failed to seek parental consent before collecting names, email addresses, and other personal information from users under the age of 13.”

In addition to the fine, TikTok has agreed to remove all videos from users under the age of 13. The app will now comply with COPPA moving forward.

In a blog post, the company explained that they will create a separate “in-app experience” for children.

“The new environment for younger users does not permit the sharing of personal information, and it puts extensive limitations on content and user interaction. Both current and new TikTok users will be directed to the age-appropriate app experience, beginning today.”

Speaking about the new under-13 ‘limited experience,’ the company continued,"

If you’re running for president, and you want to make a hush money payment to a porn star, it’s probably unwise to pay by check.

“The two were very stupid,” said Alex Ozols, a defense attorney in San Diego, referring to Cohen and Trump. “When Trump wrote the check he obviously wasn’t thinking long-term and of the consequences. Cash is essentially untraceable.”

“ ‘By writing a check for a dubious payment, one is leaving a paper trail.’ ” — —Nancy DePodesta, attorney at Saul, Ewing, Arnstein & Leh

“Obviously, by writing a check for a dubious payment, one is leaving a paper trail,” said Chicago attorney Nancy DePodesta at Saul, Ewing, Arnstein & Lehr. “People pay in cash or services, for this exact reason.” DePodesta, who was a federal prosecutor for 12 years, says checks and other proof of financial transactions were often gold dust for investigators. “We’d follow the money,” she says.

If Cohen and Trump had used cash to pay adult-film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, the transaction may have never come to light.

Cohen wrote a $135,000 check to Daniels weeks before the 2016 presidential election, so that she wouldn’t speak up publicly about her alleged sexual tryst with Trump. On Wednesday, Cohen presented Congress with checks written to him in 2017 by Trump and associates to reimburse him.

Trump has denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.

Those payments are the only concrete proof connecting Trump, Cohen and Daniels. New York prosecutors are now investigating whether they amounted to campaign-finance violations by candidate Trump. Cohen has now been disbarred in the state of New York — for a variety of offenses — and has been sentenced to jail. He is cooperating with prosecutors against Trump.

“ President Trump tweeted that Cohen was ‘lying in order to reduce his prison time.’ ”

Last year, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine after pleading guilty to tax evasion, making false statements to a financial institution, unlawful excessive campaign contributions and lying to Congress as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential elections.

Cohen on Wednesday went into details about the convoluted process — including creating a shell company — that he followed in order to keep the payments secret. He allegedly wanted to hide them from Trump’s wife Melania, Cohen’s own wife, and others, Cohen said. He also alleged that there were other hush money payments (and “not all of them had to do with women”).

President Trump tweeted TWTR, -1.67% Wednesday that Cohen was “lying in order to reduce his prison time.”

But with some simple common sense none of this would have been necessary, financial and legal experts agree.

Making legal payments with checks creates a paper trail through the banking system that anyone can follow. (Another recent example: “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett allegedly paid two men with a check to help him stage an attack.) But making payments with cash or certain other alternatives would have left them completely anonymous. That’s one reason that criminals like cryptocurrencies like bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.32%

“ Aside from cash, experts say gold bullion is the oldest money in use today. ”

The main problem with cash, legal and financial experts say, is that the banking system is already set up to track suspiciously large cash withdrawals or deposits. If you withdraw or deposit more than $10,000 at a time, the bank has to report the transaction to federal banking regulators as a suspicious activity.

Even worse, it is actually illegal to withdraw large sums under the $10,000 threshold if you are doing so in order to avoid scrutiny. (Prosecutors used that technicality to jail former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Dennis Hastert; Hastert pleaded guilty in a hush money case related to the sexual abuse of teen boys.)

Aside from cash, experts say gold bullion is the oldest money still in use today.

You can purchase unlimited amounts of gold bullion from established dealers without triggering transaction reports, and the bullion can be used in many circumstances as a substitute for U.S. dollars or other currencies.

Gold was trading at around $1,250 per troy ounce in October, 2016, around the time the Daniels hush-money payment was made. Cohen could have handed her 108 ounces — just under seven pounds — of gold Eagles or Buffaloes. Those are coins issued by the U.S. Mint and readily available from dealers.

Gold, however, leaves a transaction record when it’s bought or sold, Ozols noted.

Cynics reply: That’s an argument for buying it well ahead of time. If Michael Cohen had kept $1 million in gold Eagles in a safe in his office, he could have made hush money payoffs on behalf of Trump as needed and left no money trail at all. He might still be Trump’s attorney. He might not be disbarred or going to jail.

Trump might have learned from the case of TV talk show how and former Cincinnati mayor Jerry Springer, who was caught in a sex scandal in the 1970s when he visited a brothel and also paid by check. In Springer’s case he compounded the error because the check bounced.

Springer said in a commercial in 1982 when he was running for Governor of Ohio: “‘Nine years ago I spent time with a woman I shouldn’t have. And I paid her with a check. I wish I hadn’t done that. And the truth is, I wish no one would ever know. But in the rough world of politics, opponents are not about to let personal embarrassments lay to rest.’’"

(YouTube)

In what some observers are calling another hate crime hoax, transgender man and gay activist Nikki Joly -- a biological female who claims she is a male -- has been charged by police with burning down her own home in August 2017, an act that also killed five pets: two dogs and three cats.

Police have investigated the case for more than a year and recently arrested Joly, in Jackson, Michigan, concluding that ""he"" was the only person who had the opportunity to commit the crime.

Joly, 54, allegedly committed the crime because she apparently was disappointed in the lack of attention given to her work on helping to pass an anti-discrimiantion ordinance in Jackson and for organizing the city's first gay festival.

(Getty Images)

According to The Detroit News, on the morning of the fire, Joly bought $10 of gasoline at a Marathon station to cut her grass. She finished half the lawn and then took a break. Joly then went to work at a local church but got a call from her boyfriend, Chris Moore, at 1:02 p.m.

Moore had forgotten his lunch and asked Joly to pick it up at home and bring it to him. ""Joly returned home, which was two miles away, went inside for a minute or two, and left, he told police,"" reported The Detroit News. ""The fire was reported by neighbors at 1:16 p.m.""

""The sequence of events would have made it difficult for anyone but Joly to set the fire,"" said the police. “The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being seen,” said police detective Aaron Grove.

""No one was home as flames leaped from the house Joly shared with Moore,"" said The Detroit News. ""But the home wasn’t unoccupied. A neighbor, knowing the couple had pets, kicked in the front door but it was too hot to go inside, police said. When firefighters tried to open the back door, it was blocked by the body of a dog. All five animals died: two German Shepherds and three cats.

""Traces of gasoline were later found in five rooms on the first floor of the two-story, wooden-frame house, according to the police report.""

Joly was interviewed by the police about the fire and during the interview, ""he drooped his head, staring at the floor, not looking at his interlocutors .... He didn’t admit setting the fire and didn’t deny it, either,"" according to the news report.

Commenting on the case, the Detroit Free Press said, ""The Michigan case is gaining national attention as the American public draws parallels to the situation involving Jussie Smollett, where the supposed victim in a hate crime became the accused. Authorities concluded the attack on Smollett was a hoax.

“Real hate crimes are on the rise,” said Graham Cassano, associate professor of sociology at Oakland University. “But as these crimes increase and become publicized, it’s not surprising to me that people would take the opportunity to use this to their advantage and fabricate hate crimes.”

Joly is charged with first-degree arson. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court.

Wilfred Reilly, an associate professor of political science at Kentucky State University, is the author of the upcoming book, Hate Crime Hoax: How the Left Is Selling a Fake Race War. In the book, he documents 409 hate crime hoaxes.

""There are less than 7,000 real hate crimes reported in a typical year,"" Reilly reported in the Detroit Free Press. ""Inter-racial crime is quite rare; 84% of white murder victims and 93% of Black murder victims are killed by criminals of their own race, and the person most likely to kill you is your ex-wife or husband. When violent inter-racial crimes do occur, whites are at least as likely to be the targets as are minorities.""

""Simply put, Klansmen armed with nooses are not lurking on Chicago street corners,"" said Reilly. ""In this context, what hate hoaxers actually do is worsen generally good race relations, and distract attention from real problems."""

Turning Point USA (TPUSA) Founder and Executive Director Charlie Kirk arrived at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) on Tuesday to visit the TPUSA student members whose group was recently subjected to physical violence on campus.

UC Berkeley, a campus that was once celebrated as the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s, now appears to have become a haven of militant opposition against conservative students and visitors expressing views that fall outside of Leftist Groupthink.

The conservative students at UC Berkeley, however, remain unafraid amid apparent politically-motivated violence, despite the incident that left fellow activist Hayden Williams with a black eye while attempting to assist the students with TPUSA member recruitment last week.

I’m with brave students at @UCBerkeley, where an ACTUAL hate crime took place last week Yet it received virtually ZERO coverage I guess a conservative being attacked by leftists is less pressing than Jussie Smollett attacking himself Hate crime hoaxes hurt REAL victims! RT pic.twitter.com/8wbparUU1O — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) February 26, 2019

Kirk tweeted about his visit on Tuesday, with a photo that showed the executive director alongside UC Berkeley TPUSA students, holding a sign that read, “Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,” which was the same signage Williams had with him on the day he was assaulted last week.

Kirk also expressed his frustration over last week’s incident garnering “virtually zero coverage” by mainstream media. “I guess a conservative being attacked by leftists is less pressing than Jussie Smollett attacking himself,” added Kirk.

On Friday, the undaunted TPUSA students returned to the site where the assault had occurred to continue recruiting members for their group.

“Wow! @TPUSA at UC Berkeley continues to try and recruit students on campus despite the horrific attack by an intolerant leftist,” said Donald Trump Jr. in a tweet on Friday, “Conservatives will be bullied no more!”

The tweet included a photo of TPUSA members’ signs, which read, “The Berkeley Community Condones Hate Crimes (It’s Not Ok)” and “Your Leftist Fascism Won’t Silence Us.”

As it stands currently, the police have reportedly identified the suspect, but no arrest has been made.

UC Berkeley Assistant Vice Chancellor Dan Mogulof told Breitbart News on Tuesday that the University of California Police Department (UCPD) has concluded its investigation into last week’s assault, and is now seeking a felony warrant from the Alameda County District Attorney.

Mogulof added that the UCPD will pursue the identified suspect to make an arrest if the District Attorney issues a warrant.

Step 1 is to restore Jussie Smollett to his natural, rightful place as a victim. Today he’s aided in that effort by Scott Johnson, Michael O’Connell, and Chris Gardner at The Hollywood Reporter, who remind us that the real culprit is… Hollywood! No, seriously, the headline is “Jussie Smollett and the Pressure of Hollywood Fame.”

One question is whether the pressures and anxieties of modern fame played any role in Smollett’s seemingly inexplicable behavior. “One of the darkest corners of fame is that it becomes addictive,” says Donna Rockwell, a clinical psychologist who specializes in fame and celebrity, “and then you are so afraid of becoming a has-been or yesterday’s news that you might do something desperate…” Hollywood exerts strange and unrelenting pressures; once released within a person, they can be difficult to contain.

Well, there ya go. Hollywood did it. Who can resist its strange and unrelenting pressures? Otherwise, Smollett’s actions would be “inexplicable.”"

An Oscar-nominated actress went public with her reaction to Jussie Smollett’s apparent fake hate crime, writing a powerful guest column in The Hollywood Reporter. The piece published today under the headline “Hate Violence Is Not a Hoax” is written by Ellen Page, an LGBTQ+ activist who was nominated for an Oscar for “Juno” in 2008 and recently starred in the Netflix series “The Umbrella Academy.”

“The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath,” Page writes. “I had no reason to doubt Jussie. My work on ‘Gaycation’ — the docuseries I produced to chronicle LGBTQ+ stories from around the world — introduced me to many survivors of hate violence. I know how prevalent and pernicious it can be. If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes.”

She adds: “While the media and public debate the case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day.

“I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists. The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told.”

Their reporting team reflects back on an odd comment made by Jussie Smollett last summer in a Billboard article on how aspiring artists could “maintain their mental health.” Smollett at the time advised artists to start “admitting things” in order to stay real, but couldn’t come up with much more:

I wish I had something really deep to say but I’m in my 30s and I’m trying my best to learn that I can’t bend anymore. I’m about to break. Also for me, it’s about finding the joy in what we do. I don’t believe in happiness because I feel like happiness is an emotion that can be taken away. Joy is something that lives deep inside of you. That’s why I find joy in my sadness, frustration, love, hate, excitement, whatever emotion I’m feeling at that moment — joy is always there.

THR now wonders whether that was a cry for help:

The story, on the Billboard website, appeared in the summer of 2018. It was meant to raise consciousness about a “ubiquitous” problem in the hip-hop community: a widespread lack of awareness about the importance of mental health. Six up-and-coming artists were invited to discuss how they took care of themselves. Among them was Jussie Smollett, who, in addition to his own fledgling solo musical career, played Jamal Lyon, a singer on the hit Fox series Empire. Smollett stressed the importance of honesty in his own internal struggles. “I admit that I’m jealous, I admit that I’m insecure and that I’m not good at certain things,” he said. Then, in a comment that didn’t get any attention at the time, Smollett suggested that these pressures might be catching up to him. “I’m in my 30s and I’m trying my best to learn that I can’t bend anymore,” he said. “I’m about to break.” Six months later, he may have done just that. On Jan. 19, the actor tweeted, “Depression is a real thing y’all.” Three days later, a threatening letter targeting Smollett arrived at the Empire production offices in Chicago. And a week after that, the actor told Chicago police that two masked assailants had attacked him in a wealthy Chicago neighborhood as he walked home from a Subway at 2 a.m. while he was on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Z. Moore. Because Smollett, who is black and openly gay, identified his attackers as white males who shouted “This is MAGA country” and claimed they hung a noose around his neck, his case was immediately held up as an example of the growing problem of hate crimes in the Trump era. In Hollywood, where the alleged attack played perfectly into the community’s worst fears about prejudice, support for Smollett was strident. Robin Roberts interviewed him sympathetically on Good Morning America. Ellen Page called out the Trump administration for the incident on Colbert.

We’ll get back to Page in a moment. First, THR finds a psychologist who “specializes in fame and celebrity” to explain how they become an addiction. “You are so afraid of becoming a has-been or yesterday’s news,” Donna Rockwell claims, “that you might do something desperate.”

Seriously? The addiction reference is arguable inasmuch as success is addictive in any context, but it doesn’t relieve one of all judgment or responsibility either, nor does it explain extreme behavior. That might explain a choice to do reality-TV shows or to take up political causes, but it hardly suffices in explaining away a hate-crime hoax. Plenty of people flirt with celebrity but fail to sustain their momentum, but fewer make a success of it at the level achieved by Jussie Smollett.

Somehow, I don’t think a public appeal for sympathy over a perceived threat to celebrity will mollify the anger over Smollett’s alleged hoax. Nor should it, although celebrities like Page who went all-in on Smollett’s story to attack their political bêtes noires are trying mightily to redirect it off of themselves. THR gave Page a platform today as well for her own effort:

The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath. I had no reason to doubt Jussie. My work on Gaycation — the docuseries I produced to chronicle LGBTQ+ stories from around the world — introduced me to many survivors of hate violence. I know how prevalent and pernicious it can be. If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes. While the media and public debate the case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day. I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists. The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told.

If they want that story told in a credible way, then perhaps people such as Page should refrain from blaming people for hate crimes that never took place, or for that matter doing the same with real attacks that have nothing to do with politicians. In her column, Page never even mentions Mike Pence, on whom she laid blame for the non-existent attack on Smollett in an appearance on CBS’ The Late Show. Shouldn’t Page have apologized for that claim?

Instead, Page says that the “conversation around Jussie Smollett” has led examination of hate violence and its aftermath. That sounds perilously close to the “fake but accurate” standard promulgated by Dan Rather in 2004 after the collapse of the 60 Minutes II report on George W. Bush and the Texas Air National Guard. It also sounds like a rationalization of Smollett’s hoax and almost an appreciation of it.

If Smollett wants to claim that the hoax was a result of being “broken” by his fame addiction, as THR suggests, he has to first admit to the hoax. So far, Smollett’s chosen to double down on it. He may learn the hard way a lesson given by Christopher Plummer in The Insider. Playing 60 Minutes reporter Mike Wallace, Plummer corrects Philip Baker Hall’s Don Hewitt over the lasting nature of fame after a different scandal at the news magazine show. “Fame has a fifteen minute half-life,” Plummer says. “Infamy lasts a little longer.”"

In real life, Smollett is an African American gay man. Smollett has been charged with concocting an elaborate racist and homophobic assault against him. Smollett’s fan base, needless to say, is flummoxed. So, too, are many Americans trying to push through this deeply polarized moment.

The big question now is how Smollett’s case will affect public perception of hate crimes, especially impacting people of color and LGBTQ communities.

“Jussie has essentially set back the progress of both black folk and the LGBTQ community all while playing right into the hands of MAGA,” one online comment stated.

First hearing the story, Smollett had a groundswell of support. He said he was assaulted by two men outside of Subway who shouted “This is MAGA country” and put a noose around his neck.

The investigation showed the following: Smollett knew the two men, one has appeared on the show Empire, the rope to make the noose was bought at a nearby hardware store, the bruises on his face and body were self-inflicted, and Smollett paid the men $3,500.

However, the memo line on Smollett’s check says his payment was for a workout and nutrition program.

Smollett is now an unreliable narrator of his attack. I’ve been asking myself the same question as Chicago Chief police, Eddie Johnson, asked during his press conference: “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make a false accusation?”

Smollett’s hoax dredges up the country’s horrors of lynching and gay bashing. For me, three hate crime incidents came to my mind immediately as an African American lesbian. Emmett Till, James Byrd, and Matthew Shepard.

Emmett Till was lynched in Money, Mississippi, in 1955 and James Byrd in Jasper, Texas, in 1998. Byrd’s killing was called a “lynching-by- dragging.”

Matthew Shepard was gay-bashed to death in Laramie, Wyoming, in 1998. I give thanks to President Obama signing into law in 2009 the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, also known as the Matthew Shepard Act.

Nonetheless, Smollett is innocent in the eyes of many American Americans- straight and LGBTQ.

“I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility?” Selma film director Ava DuVernay wrote in a tweet.

“That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Despite the many inconsistencies and gaping holes in Smollett’s story, there are communities of people of color in urban cities that have every reason not to trust the police findings, especially the Chicago police, a city still recovering from the wounds of the coverup shooting for Laquan McDonald.

In 2014, McDonald, 17, was fatally shot sixteen times by white Chicago police Jason Van Dyke. Van Dyke reported his life was in danger because McDonald was packing a small knife with a blade. Van Dyke’s report was backed up by his fellow officers.

However, when the police dash-cam video was released, McDonald was walking away when shot.

In many of these communities, Smollett is perceived to be innocent, and his chances of getting a fair trial are not possible. Smollett will be seen as another victim heading toward the country’s industrial prison complex which disproportionately incarcerates black and brown men.

Smollett’s hate crime will regrettably affect public perception of hate crimes but it shouldn’t.

However, there has been an uptick of bias-related incidents and hate crimes since Trump has taken office. We have seen a rash of white people calling the cops on blacks, synagogues defaced, and 11 worshippers killed in Pittsburgh. Smollett’s hoax no doubt has tapped into our fears about our safety and our concerns of a country so polarized that we are imploding.

However, all reports of hate crimes should be taken seriously. One hoax is no excuse for law enforcement not to do their job and see each case as a separate incident irrespective of the court of opinion.

The belief that Smollett’s actions make it bad for people of color and LGBTQs to come forth in the future with their reports of hate crimes buys too easily into the notion that “one bad apple spoils the whole bunch.” Such a belief, in and of itself, is bias, suggesting people of color and LGBTQs are a monolith, and all perpetrate hoaxes.

When whites call cops on black people for being black, each case is handled individually, although the police might have suspicion for the real nature of the call.

In the court of opinion, Smollett is guilty. His actions dishonor black activist and journalist Ida B. Wells’s Anti-Lynching Campaign that took afoot in the 1890s.

This year will be the eightieth anniversary of Billy Holiday’s recording of Strange Fruit, a protest song against lynching.

And, just last year, the National Lynching Memorial opened to remember and honor the lives of men and women who were victims. Sadly, in 2019, the Senate is still trying to pass legislation to make lynching a federal hate crime.

Smollett may well have suckered us all. However, to not take each report of a hate crime seriously, because of his fraudulent actions, would be a crime, too."

Page appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on January 31 and delivered an impassioned denunciation of the Trump administration’s policies, and then later pivoted to the case of Smollett’s alleged assault, which was first reported a couple of days earlier.

“The urgency is so severe, and yet we have a media that’s barely talking about it,” Page said on the show, per TIME magazine. “We have a media that’s saying it’s a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd! This sh*t isn’t a debate.”

Page went on to tie administration policies, and specifically Vice President Mike Pence’s views, to the attack. She also made news for criticizing actor Chris Pratt for belonging to a church whose leaders have expressed anti-LGBT views.

After the Smollett story began to fall apart, with the actor brought up on charges that he filed a false police report, Page has now addressed the topic again.

In a Hollywood Reporter piece, Page only touched on Smollett briefly and did not apologize for her previous comments.

“The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath. I had no reason to doubt Jussie,” Page wrote.

She added that the work she did on Gaycation, a TV docu-series, introduced her to many survivors of hate crimes.

Page began the piece by detailing a December incident in which an intoxicated man at a Seattle Seahawks game was accused of harassing, badgering, and groping a lesbian couple and punching one of them in the face before he was fought off by surrounding fans.

According to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer the man, Jay Dee Harp III, has been charged with second-degree assault and malicious harassment, the latter under Washington State’s hate crime statute. That incident has not made national news in the way that the Smollett case did.

“We, as LGBTQ+ people, are forced to fear for our safety because instances of hate violence, like the violence these women experienced in Seattle, happen,” Page said in the piece. “They happen to us all the time.”

Page came out as gay in 2014 in a speech at a Human Rights Campaign conference, per Hollywood Reporter."

With this change, the public has lost certain values that shaped the nation for the better.

One of society’s most devastating losses is the notion of healthy skepticism. While many people simply believed what they were told, plenty of Americans did not rush to accept the ideas, news stories, and political rhetoric with which they were presented. “Question everything” was a constant refrain for these individuals. But for years, the notion of skepticism has been under assault from the progressive left, and today the nation is seeing the results of their efforts.

What Happened to Skepticism?

Two recent news stories illustrate how the left attempts to convince Americans that skepticism is an inappropriate response to situations that serve the progressive agenda. The first is the fake hate crime staged by singer-actor Jussie Smollett, who starred in the television series Empire.

When Smollett falsely claimed that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime, prominent left-leaning politicians, celebrities, and others insisted that the public believe his story, despite its critical flaws. Anything less would be racist and homophobic. Later it was revealed by the Chicago Police Department that Smollett had orchestrated the encounter as part of a plot to earn a higher salary.

Of course, one cannot forget the Covington Kids fiasco, which supposedly highlighted the abhorrent racism of Trump supporters. The first video — aired on an anonymous Twitter account — catapulted to center stage the next media-manufactured reality show. The video made it appear that bigoted high school kids harassed a poor, defenseless elderly native American there to celebrate Indigenous People’s Day. What followed was a spectacle of outrage against the demonic lily-white urchins who had the temerity to wear MAGA hats at the nation’s capital.

The left-leaning chattering class did not think it necessary to wonder what happened before the scene depicted in the video. Nobody stopped to ask, “Are we getting the full story here?” It’s hard to blame them — questioning if a particular scenario is racist is akin to celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday by walking around in blackface.

Then, somebody had to go and release the full two-hour video, which clearly showed that not only were the kids not engaging in racist behavior but they had been subject to racist epithets hurled by Black Hebrew Israelites. Even worse, the kids did not harass Nathan Phillips — the Native American man in the video — he approached them while beating his drum. Nevertheless, many on the left still insist that the boys were in the wrong.

These are not the only examples in recent memory of progressives pressuring people into accepting their preferred narrative instead of thinking critically. This behavior has been on full display in other areas as well. The #MeToo movement argues that all women who claim to be victims of sexual assault automatically should be believed, even with no evidence. Similarly under pressure are individuals who dare to question the commonly accepted narrative on climate change.

Naivete as Virtue

So how can those on the left get people to abandon skepticism? Judging from their rhetoric, leftists wish to foist a virtuous gullibility upon the public. In fact, a common way progressives virtue-signal is by running to social media to proclaim that they believe a particular narrative about certain news stories even before the facts come out. As Smollett’s account began to unravel, the hashtag #IStandWithJussie was still trending on Twitter.

This effort does not involve persuasion as much as coercion. Put simply, the progressive left isn’t trying to convince people to jump to conclusions; it forces them by shaming them as bigots if they do not gullibly conform.

To be fair, many on the left changed their opinion on Smollett when more facts emerged, but the damage was already done. During the days the story was covered in the media, Trump supporters were smeared as vile bigots who have no problem with hate crimes, which further divided the nation.

To those who value healthy skepticism, the far left promotes a philosophy of naivete. But a population that believes everything it hears is easy to manipulate. What happens when a public accepts what the media tell them without question?

Even worse, what if people start to exhibit the same type of blind trust in the government? Every day, forces try to influence our thoughts and opinions, and encouraging gullibility is yet another way to enforce a system of control. While it is not beneficial to be overly skeptical, to the point that rejects facts, Americans must not stop questioning what they are told. Otherwise, it may be too late."

Smollett claimed that last month he was attacked by two white men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs and expressed support for President Donald Trump, according to the Examiner. But Chicago police have determined that Smollett staged a hoax attack and paid two black men to carry it out.

Before the story was determined to be a hoax, Page appeared on “The Late Show” and gave an impassioned plea in which she said people should ""connect the dots"" between the Trump administration, especially Vice President Mike Pence, and the alleged attack on Smollett.

In her op-ed, Page stressed that “the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face… is the story that must be told.”

She vowed to continue speaking out to combat intolerance, because 'no one deserves to be victimized because of who they are."""

Skimming right past the news about somebody named Blake Shelton and former Harajuku girl Gwen Stefani, let’s start with my favorite gossip of the week! Amidst the news that her fraud-obsessed husband might get deported, Teresa “Prostitution Whore!” Giudice was spotted with a 26 year old named Blake Schreck in Miami last weekend. While there isn’t much to this developing story, I’ve discovered that he:

There’s also a blurb on the Jussie Smollett case that centers the word of the Chicago Police Department. I’ll be abstaining from discussing this further, but would like to note that the CPD has fabricated evidence, murdered innocent civilians, and (allegedly) refused to further investigate the strangulations of 75 women since 2001. The speed at which this case has moved should not only worry you, but prove that the police have a vested interest in disproving the existence of this and future hate crimes. My third eye is open and I will not be fooled!



I’d also like to point out that the Tristan Thompson cheating rumors surfaced alongside the allegations that chaos merchant Kim Kardashian was in cahoots with Fashion Nova to rip off designer clothing. One could argue Kris Jenner leverages her children’s personal secrets in an effort to protect their wealth accumulation! Still, isn’t it sad that denim baroness Khloe Kardashian’s business arrangemen t relationship was shattered on Heterosexual Awareness Day? There’s also allegations that Stefani Joanne Ally Maine Angelina Germanotta’s father refused to support her marriage to Christian Carino in hopes she’d wife up Jackson Maine. I wonder what he thought of the forehead touch seen ‘round the world?

I’m also obsessed with a source claiming John Cusack accidentally started a WhatsApp group message with 35 women on Raya. He apparently followed up his blunder with “Weird glitch, sorry!” Who wants to bet that his dating profile includes a “Must Love Dogs” joke?

Something that consistently shocks me about the coverage around the Sussex’s is the language employed by the tabloids. Here, “in their own words” actually refers to secondhand, anonymous sources. From a legal standpoint, it could be argued that “their” and “our” refer to the collective royal tipsters feeding the tabloids this gossip. It could also be debated that it’s a clever manipulation of language to fool you into believing Ok! has an exclusive interview with Harry & Meghan. Despite coming from an anonymous “insider”, here’s the preface to this cover story:

“Now Meghan is finally ready to set the record straight. For the first time, Ok! Can share what’s really happening behind Kensington Palace’s iron gates [...] ‘Meghan doesn’t want to address the rumors in public but feels it’s very important that people know the real story.’”

As reported last week, the gossip circuit is ablaze with rumors that chaos merchant Kylie Jenner is three months pregnant with Travis Scott’s baby. The bulk of the evidence for this particular rumor is a series of photographs outside a doctor’s office in Beverly Hills. “Insiders” also claim “Kylie’s always said she wants four kids, and she wants to have them all in her early 20s.” There’s also the allegation that Fit Tea Federation leader Kris Jenner refuses to let the SICKO MODE (ft. Drake) rapper marry her youngest cash cow. According to tipsters,

“She’s seen her daughters go through countless breakups and divorces, and being a divorceé herself, she’s skeptical about the idea of a marriage lasting forever.”

To clarify, there have been 5 official divorces and approximately 40 public “breakups” amongst Kris and her Kohorts. Somebody should give this incredibly interesting family with so much public heartbreak a television show!

We’re also told that Jackson Maine and Stefani Joanne Ally Maine Angelina Germanotta are set to “finally go public.” While there was certainly a forehead touch seen ‘round the world, the Oscars came and went without much scandal for the two. Still, Life & Style posits that A Star Is Born has cursed the relationships it touched: Bradley Cooper & somebody named Irina Shayk, Lady Gaga & Taylor Kinney, and now Lady Gaga & Christian Carino. I can’t wait to listen to a podcast on this in 20 years! Even better is a fantastic blurb on the record number of women quitting The Bachelor when faced with the prospect of marrying anthropomorphic bran muffin Colton Underwood. In his own words: “Every time I put myself out there, I get fucking rejected.” Maybe you should Investigate that, Colton!

What else? Melissa Gorga wants her own television show and Sharon Stone stormed off the set of a Chanel West Coast music video. (Who?) Jeremy Piven is allegedly strapped for cash after peddling his Malibu home for $4 million below the original price. Stand-up comedy isn’t for everyone, Jeremy! A few pages later is more fatphobic propaganda against Jessica Simpson and her totally regular pregnancy, proving that society might have progressed (slightly) but the tabloids never will! There’s also an interesting report that Luann De Lesseps, of Countess and Friends fame, might be headed back to jail after failing to prove she’s attending her mandated AA meetings. Please god, keep the cameras rolling!

Us Weekly:

This week’s Us Weekly features a spread on Mandy Moore’s story of escaping an abusive marriage to Ryan Adams. While I generally find second-hand sources in stories of abuse like this opportunistic and distasteful, it’s mostly a retelling of what we already know:

Ryan Adams used his influence in the music industry to control Mandy Moore’s financial wellbeing and career.

Her career hit a “slump” after her marriage to Adams.

The FBI is looking into his communications with an underage fan.

Much like Harvey Weinstein, Bryan Singer, Kevin Spacey, more: stories about Ryan Adams have circulated on gossip sites for years. Despite the obvious heartache with each new tale of abuse and trauma surfacing post-#MeToo, I’m praying that his victims find peace and resolution (and, if anything, justice.)

The article, titled “A conservative activist was punched in the face at UC Berkeley. The response enraged the right,” is the first and only article the media outlet has published on the attack.

Background: On February 19, an activist working for the Leadership Institute was on the University of California-Berkeley’s campus helping conservative group Turning Point USA recruit students. The activist, Hayden Williams, was not a Berkeley student but was helping recruit when two men approached him on campus and began cursing. One became aggressive and pushed Williams before punching him in the face.

The encounter was caught on video and published by LI’s Campus Reform website. Williams told Fox Business host Stuart Varney that the men confronted him over a sign posted by TP USA that said, “Hate crime hoaxes hurt real victims,” a reference to the Jussie Smollett allegations which are being treated as a hoax by Chicago police.

A week after the attack, Berkeley officials said police had identified a suspect and were preparing to arrest him and charge him with a felony. While police appear to have acted properly, national media outlets treated the story far differently than they did Smollett’s allegations. Newsweek, for example, reported Smollett’s allegations as fact, despite multiple red flags that the story was not plausible. When video of the attack at Berkeley surfaced, Newsweek reported that a conservative student was “allegedly assaulted.” It would be nice to assume the outlet learned from the mistakes of the Smollett case, but given the media’s track record it seems unlikely.

Berkeley also waited days to condemn the attack, something that doesn’t happen on college campuses when an alleged racist incident occurs. The Post tried to wash over this by saying the university condemned the attack “within days,” as if that were an appropriate amount of time to wait.

A campus-wide email about the assault wasn’t sent until conservative activists complained on Twitter.

The Post’s article follows a long line of “Republicans pounce” or “Republicans seize” headlines from the outlet and others that are used to report news that hurts Democrats. The headlines are used to avoid directly addressing the harmful news, and are instead reported from the angle of how Republicans reacted to the news. Such couching is not done in reverse."

Robbins

Opinion columnist

The Michael Cohen hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee was billed as an impending significant blow to the Trump presidency. We were told the coming revelations would be “detailed, sordid and chilling.” The disclosures were supposed to be “earth shattering.”

Instead, by the midafternoon break, there was no moment of high drama, and nothing particularly revelatory. The testimony turned out to be overhyped and underwhelming.

This was the first of what promises to be a series of public political spectacles organized by House Democrats seeking to embarrass and potentially impeach President Donald Trump ahead of the 2020 election. The optics were not good. The star witness, Cohen, who previously lied to Congress, was a disbarred, convicted perjurer and tax evader who is on his way to jail. The event was organized by Cohen’s allegedly pro-bono lawyer Lanny Davis, a longtime Clinton family operative who sat behind him while Cohen spoke. And Cohen’s team consulted with committee Democrats in preparing his testimony.

Thus, despite Chairman Elijah Cummings’ statement that the committee was “in search of the truth,” there was no whiff of objectivity in this process. It was a political hit job.

The most important headline from the hearing should be that Cohen, a “fixer” who claims to have been as close to the Trump operation as anyone could be for over a decade, has no proof of Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., tried to badger Cohen into saying President Trump lied about his Russia dealings, but to Cohen’s credit she failed.

Cohen's thin evidence

Nevertheless, Cohen chose to feed uncorroborated speculation on the issue, for example mentioning a July 2016 phone call he said he overheard in which Roger Stone supposedly told President Trump that WikiLeaks was going to publish the hacked Hillary Clinton emails. But Cohen’s timeline is off because WikiLeaks had already announced in June 2016 that it intended to publish the emails, so this bomb was a dud.

There were also questions about the Trump hotel project in Moscow — a plan dating to the 1980s that never came to fruition. Cohen poured cold water on the BuzzFeed story alleging that President Trump had instructed him to lie to Congress about the project, and said the idea of offering Vladimir Putin a penthouse in the tower was just a publicity stunt to drive up rental prices.

And it is still unclear how this never-completed long-term proposal could possibly connect to Russian interference in an election that — according to Cohen — Donald Trump viewed as simply an “infomercial.” It would have been far easier just to build the hotel without seeking the White House. And despite Cohen’s impression that Trump shows deference to Putin, the president’s official record — including pulling out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, taking a hard line against Russian ally Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela and arming Ukraine — would make him the worst colluder in history.

Cohen revealed a reimbursement check signed by Donald Trump on Aug. 1, 2017, that Cohen claimed was evidence in “a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws” regarding payoffs to Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels. This is tied to ongoing investigations by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York of alleged finance violations by the Trump campaign. President Trump denies that the payments violated the law, and that any potential issues arose later because of bad legal advice from people like Cohen.

Plus, it is impossible to believe that someone with Trump’s lifetime of business dealings would knowingly pay someone by check to conduct criminal activity. He’s no Jussie Smollett.

This issue will be played out elsewhere, but the primary significance of the check is the date, since Democrats are eager to find any excuse to claim that President Trump has done things while in office that would allow them, in the words of Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., to “lay some sort of soft cornerstone for future impeachment proceedings.”

Trump just like other businessmen

Cohen’s assessment of Trump’s character, namely that he is a “racist, a con man and a cheat,” is what you might expect from someone pursuing a vendetta. But he offered no evidence to substantiate his charge of racism, and the documents he produced on other charges seemed trivial.

Cohen told us that President Trump wanted to appear wealthier than he was for publicity purposes while also trying legally to minimize his property taxes, which probably makes him like most wealthy businessmen. Cohen seemed to think it significant that President Trump took action to prevent the illegal release of his SAT scores and college transcripts — documents we have not seen from other recent presidents, either. And Cohen asserted that President Trump has no interest in making America a better place, even as the president is in Vietnam trying to keep his promises to do that very thing.

Ultimately, the hearing delivered none of the promised bombshells, but it did serve the Democratic political narrative as Democrats prepare for the rapidly approaching post-Mueller, post-collusion world in which they need to move on to other ways to attempt to overturn the 2016 election. In that respect, Cohen did what he was expected to do.

Now he can go to prison.

In New Jersey, an 81-year-old was reportedly assaulted at a Shop Rite in New Jersey for wearing a “Make American Great Again” hat. The incident occurred in Franklin Township.

An 81-year-old man was allegedly attacked in New Jersey by someone who confronted him for wearing one of President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" hats. Somerset County prosecutors said that the man was assaulted at a supermarket after being confronted by the alleged assailant over the hat, according to a local NBC affiliate. The victim had minor injuries and refused medical treatment, the outlet reported, citing local prosecutors.

Is this a hoax or just a misperception? We’ll find out. I won’t be like CNN and say “this is America in 2019.”

Should we at least say there was an alleged politically motivated assault and report on that? Sure. And it’s safe to presume that a very elderly man didn’t allegedly hire someone to assault him in a supermarket to further his career, whatever that may be for this person. At the same time, we’ll probably once again see a story where a MAGA supporter was reportedly assaulted for expressing his political beliefs, which gets zero coverage from the mainstream press, but they will devote hours of coverage to Jussie Smollett, who has been charged for orchestrating the non-hate crime against himself in the streets of Chicago. This game never gets old."

“A law enforcement source told News 4 the attack happened at the ShopRite of Somerset on Elizabeth Avenue,” the news station continued. “The attack left the man with minor injuries, prosecutors said.”

Fellow shoppers at the store expressed outrage at what happened, regardless of politics. “I think it’s very disgusting, the person that attacked him is a coward,” area resident Carlos Mendez told the NBC station.

Additional details about the attack and the suspect were still forthcoming as of Wednesday, but thankfully it sounds like the 81-year-old victim will be OK.

What’s not OK, however, is the shocking frequency with which these assaults seem to be happening.

While disgraced actor Jussie Smollett made national headlines by faking a lynching with a hoax meant to smear Trump supporters, real-life “MAGA” attacks are taking place. They just happen to be targeted toward conservatives.

Meanwhile, the establishment media doesn’t seem very interested in drawing attention to these cases, at least not at the national level. Comparing the coverage of the alleged attack on this elderly man to the media’s breathless obsession with the Smollett hoax is particularly eye-opening.

On Wednesday, for example, we reported on a man who was simply trying to order food at a restaurant when an irate woman assaulted him for wearing a red pro-Trump hat. She had to be removed from the establishment by police, who later discovered that she was an illegal alien from Brazil.

Even students have been targeted for harassment and violent assault for simply supporting the president. High school teachers have gotten in on the action, essentially bullying students who dare hold different political views.

Some cases are far more frightening, such as this incident where a man allegedly pulled a gun and pointed it at a Trump supporter — again, all because of a presidential campaign hat.

There’s plenty of room in America for disagreement and debate, but this is not the way. If the left truly believes in “going high,” then they need to take a long, hard look in the mirror.

The rigid social classes of the 1800s have been replaced with an equally rigid system of “intersectionality,” whereby a person’s power and privilege are determined by the amount of melanin in their skin. Those on the lower rungs of the new caste system must adhere to intersectional ideology in order to compensate for being born with the “wrong” skin color. Strict adherence results in high-society acceptance and a scar-free reputation. A person with high melanin tones is encouraged to opine about any subject — unless their views fall outside accepted dogma.

Jussie Smollett, the “Empire” actor, is accused of taking these new rules too seriously by falsely reporting himself as the victim of a racially motivated attack. Apparently, no one told him there are still lines that can’t be crossed. And really, why would he think there would be? He only took intersectionality to its logical conclusion.

Meanwhile, this new era’s tragicomedies are hitting Jews who are desperate to fit in. Despite the melanin in our skin, we are constantly being told that we are white, white, WHITE! As such, we must take our place in the back of the room, at a separate table, in constant repentance. We are told we have no say in anything, even — especially! — if the subject is anti-Semitism. We are encouraged to malign one another as viciously as possible. Malign a fellow Jew, gain a status point.

“The whole point of suddenly making Jews white, white, WHITE is that we are then incapable of being targets of racism.”

It’s not surprising that such attitudes have contributed to soaring increases in reports of anti-Semitism. Yes, it is illegal in the intersectional guidebook to make a connection between the new caste system and anti-Semitism. After all, the whole point of suddenly making Jews white, white, WHITE is that we are then incapable of being targets of racism.

I know I will be duly punished for this column, both by my fellow Jews (eager to score a week’s worth of status points) and non-Jews (eager to be, well, anti-Semites). But it’s hard to look at the anti-Semitic incidents in New York City alone — reaching almost 50 in less than two months — and not come to this conclusion.

Perhaps the saddest part of this intersectional nightmare is how it threatens to take us back to a less-perfect time. My son and his friends are living Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream. They gather at school or in Central Park, unaffected by one another’s skin color or ethnicity. The other day, as I watched them playing football with two boys from Mexico, I kept thinking of the film “The Perfect Game,” about a group of Mexican boys in the 1950s who struggled against racism when they came to the United States to play baseball.

We have come so far since the ’50s, and yet intersectionalists are desperate to take us back. Why? I can only guess. But perhaps they need to revisit what real racism was so they can understand the horrific damage they’re doing right now.

Regardless, as Jews — because we’re Jews — we need to end this intersectional farce. As New York Times columnist Bari Weiss said during a recent speaking engagement at a Manhattan synagogue, Jews on the left no longer have the luxury of staying silent. Just as important, we need to regain pride in our heritage and our values that have brought so much light into the world. “We are used to being powerless,” Weiss said. “We now need to learn how to use our power — to create a Judaism of affirmation. This will light a fire in every Jewish soul.”

And if it doesn’t, Weiss warned with a reference to anti-Semite Jeremy Corbyn, who has been gaining power as the leader of Britain’s Labor Party: “A slow, insidious Corbynism is coming to America.”

They were so sure it was true. It confirmed all their biases. It reminded them how much better they are than the rest of us. It was so perfect. Now that their self-satisfaction has blown up in their Botoxed faces, how do they rationalize all their precious prejudices? How do they preserve their worldview in defiance of the facts?

Step 1 is to restore Jussie Smollett to his natural, rightful place as a victim. Today he’s aided in that effort by Scott Johnson, Michael O’Connell, and Chris Gardner at The Hollywood Reporter, who remind us that the real culprit is… Hollywood! No, seriously, the headline is “Jussie Smollett and the Pressure of Hollywood Fame.”

One question is whether the pressures and anxieties of modern fame played any role in Smollett’s seemingly inexplicable behavior. “One of the darkest corners of fame is that it becomes addictive,” says Donna Rockwell, a clinical psychologist who specializes in fame and celebrity, “and then you are so afraid of becoming a has-been or yesterday’s news that you might do something desperate…”

Hollywood exerts strange and unrelenting pressures; once released within a person, they can be difficult to contain.

Well, there ya go. Hollywood did it. Who can resist its strange and unrelenting pressures? Otherwise, Smollett’s actions would be “inexplicable.”

Yeah, yeah, I know what you’re saying: “But there are lots of actors in Hollywood, and almost none of them are hate-crime hoaxers!” You might think Jussie Smollett did this because he’s a “jerk” or an “idiot” or a “bad person,” but nothing could be further from the truth. He’s a victim of circumstances. This was done to him by forces beyond his control.

Here are a few reasons Jussie is still the aggrieved party here. Put yourself in his shoes and tell me you’d do anything differently:

He was a child actor and then the work dried up. Smollett appeared in The Mighty Ducks when he was nine years old, and a few years later he and his five siblings — Jojo, Jazz, Jurnee, Jake, and Jocqui — starred in an ABC sitcom called On Our Own. The show was canceled after one season, and then Jussie didn’t get regular work in Hollywood until Empire premiered 20 years later. In the interim, he was reduced to taking odd jobs, and he tried to launch a music career that never took off. Why, at one point he had to make ends meet with monthly residual checks from The Mighty Ducks. Can you even imagine such a hellish existence?

In the interim, he was reduced to taking odd jobs, and he tried to launch a music career that never took off. Why, at one point he had to make ends meet with monthly residual checks from The Mighty Ducks. Can you even imagine such a hellish existence? He came out as gay even though he was ambivalent about it at first. In 2015, Smollett appeared on Ellen and talked around audience questions about his sexual orientation. But then he gave Ellen DeGeneres a second interview in which he said he’s gay. He didn’t like the resulting public scrutiny of his private life: “Everybody had these expectations of what I should be, how I should be, who I should be seen with… And I just wasn’t used to that.” So you can see why he’d commit a hoax, right?

He got signed to a record label but he didn’t like the executives. The success of Empire led Columbia Records to sign Smollett, but he didn’t enjoy dealing with “a room full of old straight white men.” So he broke the deal, recorded an album on his own independent label, and watched it go nowhere. What would you do if you blew an opportunity like that? You’d pretend to be the victim of a hate crime, that’s what.

What would you do if you blew an opportunity like that? You’d pretend to be the victim of a hate crime, that’s what. Faking a hate crime doesn’t disprove the fact that hate crimes really happen. A few weeks ago, former movie star Ellen Page went viral when she blamed people who had nothing to do with a hate crime that didn’t actually happen. But in a guest editorial for THR today, Page explains: “The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath. I had no reason to doubt Jussie. My work on Gaycation — the docuseries I produced to chronicle LGBTQ+ stories from around the world — introduced me to many survivors of hate violence. I know how prevalent and pernicious it can be. If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes.” See, it’s not Ellen Page’s fault for spreading a hoax. She’s not responsible for saying things that weren’t true. If she’s wrong, why is she still so angry? Page was speaking her truth, and she’s a victim, and so is Jussie, so you should really stop oppressing them with your “facts” and “logic.”

Jussie Smollett sought fame and fortune his whole life. Then he got it, and it wasn’t enough. So he pretended to be a victim of a hate crime to draw even more attention to himself. If you hold him accountable for his own actions, you’re just hurting actual victims.

Well, Smollett is an actual victim too, but you know what I mean. Shut up, you straight white male!"

""So this is the new official story, the one you are going to be hearing for a long time, the one your kids will be learning about in school and it's this,"" Carlson said Friday. ""A specific hate crime may not have happened in this case, but hate crimes overall are incredibly common and the incidence of them is rising, so the lesson of Jussie Smollett isn't to be more skeptical of hate crimes, but to be more credulous.""



""CNN wants that to be your take away from the whole thing. It doesn't matter that its anchor slandered and defamed almost half the country over a lie. There is a much more important point here, listen,"" he said.











""Hate hoaxes are so common that you could write a whole book about them and people have, it's all public,"" Carlson said. ""You ought to look it up. Spend an afternoon reading the stories before they get scrubbed off the internet. It's an education. You will never believe CNN again. Trust me.""





TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS: Well, when Jussie Smollett's hoax was still being investigated by the police, ""The New York Times"" and other media outlets suggested that it was a quote, ""conspiracy theory"" to suspect that his claims might not be true. The message was, ""Shut up and believe it or else you're a bad person if not clinically insane.""



Now, as is so often the case, the few people who were willing to think for themselves turned out to be absolutely right. The press is scrambling to explain how exactly did that happen? How could reporters who are literally paid to be skeptical have fallen for such an obvious lie? It's not an easy question to answer. It's far easier just to pretend the whole thing never happened and that's what some are doing.



Jeff Bezos' ""Washington Post"" for example, carries the almost amusingly pompous slogan, ""Democracy dies in darkness."" It's right on the masthead. And yet, just yesterday, ""The Post"" did its best to add to that darkness. The newspaper refused to run a single news story about Jussie Smollett's hoax. If you got your news from ""The Washington Post,"" you would still believe that Smollett was attacked by white racists for the crime of opposing Donald Trump.



MSNBC did pretty much the same thing. Once Smollett was arrested, the channel did not even cover the story in prime time. Other journalists have decided that Smollett cannot be guilty, he simply can't be. Somebody must have set him up, probably from the racist Chicago Police Department. In other words, if the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



SYMONE SANDERS, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, CNN I think we need to see some of the evidence. I think it's very concerning that all of these leaks came from the Chicago Police Department. So frankly, all we have is leaks from the Chicago Police Department, now what they said in this press conference and what Jussie Smollett and his team have said.



ZACH STAFFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE ADVOCATE: This Police Department did in 2016, openly through their union, support Donald Trump. So to have a police department that hasn't been as cooperative as they have been in this round, do not openly give information, do openly lie and mishold information in cases and then to know that they are openly -- have openly supported Donald Trump of the 2016 election, a lot of activists on the ground are saying, ""Wait, what's going on here? Who do we believe out of these two suspect people?""



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: So was it a racist conspiracy from the Chicago Police Department? That's a little far even for a lot of people on cable news. So those people can say that yes, perhaps Jussie Smollett's claims weren't entirely factually true, but so what? They could have been.



Actual Trump supporters may not have assaulted him on the street in Chicago, but they would have it if they could have.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



MISCHELLE TURNER, CONTRIBUTOR, CNN: If it is true, didn't he in fact attempt to paint MAGA supporters as these racist and homophobic people?



TIFFANY CROSS, CO-FOUNDER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, THE BEAT DC: But Mischelle, I have to respectfully disagree, I think MAGA supporters have painted themselves as that. I mean, when you look at footage, when you hear things they say, this is the honest to goodness truth and we have to be bold enough to call that out.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: So this is the new official story, the one you are going to be hearing for a long time, the one your kids will be learning about in school and it's this. A specific hate crime may not have happened in this case, but hate crimes overall are incredibly common and the incidence of them is rising, so the lesson of Jussie Smollett isn't to be more skeptical of hate crimes, but to be more credulous.



CNN wants that to be your take away from the whole thing. It doesn't matter that its anchor slandered and defamed almost half the country over a lie. There is a much more important point here, listen.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



DON LEMON, ANCHOR, CNN: This is an America where hate groups, hate crimes are on the rise.



VAN JONES, ANCHOR, CNN: The reality is, there has been a rise in hate crimes. There has been a rise in intolerance.



CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN: We know that hate crimes are on the rise, a lot of people don't want to accept that, they want this to be trumped up.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: So the problem with what you just heard is, it's a crock, it's totally false. In fact, it's provably untrue. Anyone who says otherwise like the people you just heard is either intentionally misleading you or doesn't understand the numbers and that would include most journalists.



Type in the phrase ""hate crimes"" into Google and you will see story after story claiming that thousands of these atrocities take place every year in our country and the incidence of them is rising.



A story in Vice News yesterday for example claimed that in 2017, there were 7,175 hate crimes in America. Now, reporters almost never do their own statistical analysis for stories like this. They tend to be bad at math. In fact, that's why they are journalists in the first place and not in private equity making real money.



So instead, reporters take their numbers wholesale from partisan activists who pose as researches or from holy fraudulent organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center. These groups use moral panics to gin up fund- raising. They get rich doing it, so of course, they continue. The problem is there aren't that many hate crimes occurring in the country, it's just not a very hateful place so they have to make them up. How do they do that? They do it, and this is key, by counting accusations as crimes.



An accusation is not the same thing as a crime, it's not even close. So if I accuse you of committing armed robbery that does not need that robbery occurred. You have to be convicted of it and once you are, I can count what you did as a crime. Otherwise, it's just something that you said, it doesn't mean anything.



In real life, hate crimes are rare, consider the numbers from California, it's by far our biggest state. Nearly 40 million people live in California. Its demographics have changed dramatically in recent years. So if hate crimes were an epidemic, you would expect to see an awful lot of hate crimes in California, but you don't.



In 2017, in the state of California, they convicted a total of 65 people for committing hate crimes, that's out of 39.5 million people. In other words, far more people got face tattoos or died while taking a shower than committed hate crimes, 65 hate crimes. And by the way, that number has fallen, not risen. In 1996, California recorded 87 hate crimes. So that's the growing epidemic that Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo were just telling you about. They are lying. It's a fraud.



Hate hoaxes by contrast are common. The media spends a lot of time denying that which is your first tip that it's real. Just this morning, ""The New York Times"" wrote a headline that began ""Hate Crime Hoaxes Are Rare.""



""Rolling Stone"" whose most famous story ever was a hoax, assures us that quote, ""False reports of hate crimes are exceedingly rare."" All the rest of the newsroom lemmings nod their heads in agreement, ""Um, yes, don't believe your eyes, this stuff never happens."" But it does happen, in fact, it happens regularly.



Indeed, the higher the profile of the hate crime, the more likely it is to be fake. Those racist messages at the Air Force Academy, you might have read about. The General who runs the place gave an anguished response speech that seemed sincere and it went viral. But the whole thing was fiction. The fake victims did it to themselves.



How about those three University of Albany students who were attacked by white supremacist on the bus a few years ago. Hillary Clinton immediately weighed in, of course, she was deeply outraged, ""This is America,"" she said. It turns out the three students were the dangerous ones themselves. They had attacked a woman and then invented a hoax to cover their tracks.



Threats to Jewish Community Centers were a huge story in 2017. The press suggested they were the work of some deranged anti-Semitic Trump supporters, assuming that's not redundant in the view of the press.



Once again, totally fake. An Israeli teenager did it. And so on and on and on. In the space of a single month, November 2016, there were at least 13 well-publicized hate crimes that turned out to be hoaxes - thirteen. That was also the month that Trump got elected, which tells you what's really going on here. Hate hoaxes are politically useful and that's why people continue to stage them.



We can go on about this and give you many more examples starting with the Covington story just last month. There are lots and lots of examples. Hate hoaxes are so common that you could write a whole book about them and people have, it's all public. You ought to look it up. Spend an afternoon reading the stories before they get scrubbed off the internet. It's an education. You will never believe CNN again. Trust me."

It is fantastic to contemplate such a thing in the U.S., which is fundamentally prouder of nothing than of its Constitution and the immense place that the system created by that Constitution and maintained these 230 years by recourse to interpretation and reassertion of it has played in the unprecedented rise of America from a loosely connected group of colonists numbering only a few million at independence to the overwhelming preeminence of the U.S.A. at the end of the Second World War.

That preeminence has been substantially maintained since.

For at least 60 years I have heard high American officials announce that the United Sates is not a ""banana republic."" Of course it is not, and never was. But there is a complacency about America’s status as a society of laws that is both unbecoming and unjustified. As many judges, lawyers, and commentators have noted, the level of prosecution success in criminal cases is over 95 percent, 97 percent of those without a trial; these, and the proportion of the population that is incarcerated, are totalitarian numbers.

Congressional investigations where there is no lawyer–client privilege, the ease of alleging and gaining convictions on charges of dishonest responses to the police, as well as media trials long before a defense has even been filed (as in the Jussie Smollett case, where the chief of police of Chicago has been garrulously babbling out the prosecution evidence); all of this is a Star Chamber. None of it would be admissible in any other serious common-law country, such as Great Britain, Canada, Australia, or Ireland.

Every nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court is now a pitched battle replete with paid demonstrators at hearings and extensive campaigns of character assassination, but that court has sat inert as practically all the Bill of Rights’ constitutional assurances of due process, prompt and impartial justice, and the avoidance of capricious prosecutions have been abandoned.

It is in this, as other civilized jurisdictions would consider it, tenuous state of the rule of law that the antics of the Comey-McCabe FBI and Brennan-Clapper intelligence direction, and their partisan effort to bend the law to install Hillary Clinton as president and sandbag Donald Trump, should be considered.

Celebrated as Thomas Jefferson rightly is for his seminal role in the creation of the country’s initial texts and its early governance, one achievement for which he has received insufficient credit is the founding of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1802.

While this began as a corps of engineers limited to 20 men at first (led by Benjamin Franklin’s nephew, Jonathan Williams), the objective was to assure a non-political class of officers. The focus on engineering was, at this early stage, the young nation’s chief military requirement.

Jefferson’s initiative assured the U.S. of a nonpolitical military. The country has had twelve presidents who were celebrated combat military officers, from Washington to Eisenhower, including citizen generals such as Jackson, Hayes, and Garfield.

And it has had a number of presidents who were distinguished middle or junior officers, including Presidents Truman, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and George H. W. Bush, and six high-ranking military officers who were unsuccessful presidential candidates, including the first Republican candidate, Colonel John C. Frémont; a general fired by Abraham Lincoln as commander of the Army of the Potomac, George B. McClellan, who had the effrontery to run against Lincoln in 1864; and a hero POW, John McCain.

The point of this recitation is that none of these people dabbled in politics while they were in the armed forces. The only serious figure who did so was General Douglas MacArthur, who, in response to a freshet of Republican-delegate enthusiasm from a midwestern state while he was preparing to liberate the Philippines, wrote to a supporter for public circulation a letter stating that he would accept the Republican nomination in 1944, but would be unable to campaign (as if his commander in chief, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, would tolerate such a thing from a serving theater commander).

When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in 1952, and was asked when he became Republican, he replied: “Today.” No soldier has led Great Britain since Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century, except the Duke of Wellington, for two years.

The federal police (FBI) are another matter. The leader of a successful previous organization and of the FBI for a total of 47 years, J. Edgar Hoover, has been strenuously criticized for his unscrupulous political machinations, but he never attempted to influence a presidential election. When the military are depoliticized, the secret police and intelligence services, if not reined in, can be very powerful, in a democratic country as in a dictatorship.

In the Soviet Union, the army only briefly was politically influential, under Marshal Zhukhov just after the death of Stalin, while Stalin’s last three secret-police leaders, Yagoda, Yezhov, and Beria, were all summarily executed after they had done a great deal of his unimaginable dirty work.

Even in revolutionary and Napoleonic France, the greatest police minister in all history, the egregiously cunning Joseph Fouché, who sent the head of the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre, to the guillotine at the end of the Reign of Terror, after Robespierre had tried to do the same to him, was sent packing finally, rich but mistrusted and powerless.

American democracy is insuperably strong in the hearts of the people and in 230 years of triumphant survival through a vehement and contentious national history. But the recent fantastic cascade of professions of righteous untouchability from Comey and McCabe and Brennan and Clapper shows that there is no institutional tradition of respect for and deference to the constitutional integrity of the system in the main police and intelligence agencies.

Though fired for dishonesty and sent for grand-jury evaluation as a criminal lying to Congress and out of control, Andrew McCabe generally enjoys the support of the Trump-hating media in his book tour, celebrating a lawless disregard for the supremacy of the people under the Constitution. He feared that Trump might be a ""Russian asset,"" and accordingly set a special counsel with practically unlimited powers, who engaged a fervently partisan Democratic staff, upon him.

Almost the entire legal system of the United States requires radical reform and democratization, and the disarming of a virtually omnipotent prosecutocracy.

It is the strength and the weakness of America that it is not really the gentle and kindly country portrayed by Norman Rockwell and Walt Disney. That America exists and is a revered pastoral self-image.

But the U.S. is ultimately a jungle, and jungles are ruled by 30-foot constricting snakes and 600-pound cats, and these are usually the rulers of America, with a varying level of humanization.

The intense struggle for the highest positions in the country is a generally meritocratic struggle, with only rare lapses into mediocrity. The survival and elevation process leaves an inordinate number of severely shattered people. In such a society, the senior police and intelligence apparatus can be dangerous, and in the last few years, it has been.

The outcome of the present struggle for power in Washington should include tighter civilian control of these agencies, as in the military, the end of the effort to criminalize policy differences, and the end of the attempted reduction of the drastic remedy of impeachment to a partisan power play to reverse the result of elections.

That is essentially what it was in the Nixon and Clinton presidencies and has been since the 2016 election.

The United States has had a close call with something close to banana republicanism, and it must draw and apply the lessons of this turbulent time.

It has become common practice for mainstream media organizations to focus on the “Republicans pounce” aspect of any story that would appear unfavorable to the left. In this case, the Post's story was headlined: “A conservative activist was punched in the face at UC Berkeley. The response enraged the right."" It cited a Fox News report published Tuesday, one of several which has been published since the incident occurred last week.

CONSERVATIVES CALL OUT UC POLICE FOR LACK OF ARREST ONE WEEK AFTER BERKELEY CAMPUS ASSAULT ON ACTIVIST

The incident, which was captured on a cell phone, occurred as the activist, Hayden Williams, was manning a recruiting table for Turning Point USA, a conservative organization. Williams, who is not a student, told Fox News last week that he filed a police report immediately after the incident.

Alex Szarka, a Berkeley junior, told Fox News he was walking on campus last week when he saw the altercation and decided to videotape it. The attack quickly went viral in conservative circles but was largely overlooked by the mainstream media.

A search of Williams’ name and the word ""Berkeley"" on the Post’s website doesn’t show any mention of the attack prior to Wednesday’s piece about the right being “enraged.”

ACTIVIST ASSAULTED AT BERKELEY SAYS CAMPUSES EMBEDDED WITH CULTURE OF HOSTILITY TO CONSERVATIVES

Post reporter Katie Mettler wrote that UC Berkeley officials were gearing up to apprehend the suspect but pivoted to the response of conservatives by the third paragraph.

“The news comes after a seven-day campaign by conservative activists both at Berkeley and nationally, who have argued, on social media, right-leaning political websites and Fox News, that because of liberal bias, the attack garnered what they perceive as a delayed response from the police and university and a muted response from the public,” Mettler wrote.

Mettler cited a Donald Trump Jr. tweet in which the president’s oldest son pondered, “Wonder if it would be the same if a conservative beat up a leftist on the Berkeley Campus?”

The Post then put an emphasis on the university denying that it acted with a liberal bias before detailing the attack itself.

Media Research Center vice president Dan Gainor is among the critics of the newspaper’s coverage.

“This is incredible,"" Gainor told Fox News. ""The left-wing Washington Post ignores a hate crime against a young conservative for eight days. Then when it finally chimes in, it’s with the latest version of conservatives pounce. “Instead of reporting the news, the Post notes how conservatives are upset and that, ‘The response enraged the right.’”

MSNBC'S AVOIDANCE OF JUSSIE SMOLLETT STORY DURING PRIMETIME 'A POLITICALLY BIASED JOURNALISTIC CHOICE,’ EXPERT SAYS

Gainor added: “How dare right-wingers be upset that someone got attacked on a college campus because of his politics and the major media all-but ignored it? Especially after turning repeated hate hoaxes into national news stories – like Jussie Smollett. It’s also worth noting that the Post is being sued for $250 million for how awfully it covered the Covington hoax"".

The Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The framing of the story was quickly ridiculed on social media:

Meanwhile, Williams told Fox News on Friday that he’s been attacked before while helping recruit on college campuses, including two weeks ago at U.C.L.A., but never to the degree he was at Berkeley.

(AP) — Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist tried to fabricate a hate crime by setting his home on fire, but the man’s attorney is questioning the evidence.

Attorney Daniel Barnett said the evidence is circumstantial and doesn’t provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Nikki Joly set the August 2017 fire that killed five pets at his home in Jackson.

The 54-year-old Joly was charged last year with first-degree arson. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court, The Detroit News reported.

“We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,” Elmer Hitt, Jackson’s director of police and fire services, said Monday. “We investigated it over what probably was a year’s time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.”

MLive.com obtained the arson investigation report that says gas station surveillance video shows Joly buying gasoline the day of the fire and traces of gasoline was found on his clothes. Phone records and witness statements show Joly was home around the time the fire was set, the report said.

“The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being seen,” police detective Aaron Grove wrote in the report.

Hitt declined to provide a potential motive for the arson. Barnett said the lack of motive causes doubt in the prosecutor’s case.

“It doesn’t make sense,” Barnett said. ”(Joly) was citizen of the year.”

A local newspaper selected Joly as Jackson’s citizen of the year in 2018. Joly helped open the city’s first gay community center, organized its first gay pride festival and helped pass a nondiscrimination ordinance.

Chicago police last week charged the black and gay “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting a racist and homophobic attack."

Tuesday night, a week after the incident, UC Berkeley officials announced that police were preparing to apprehend a suspect, who has not been publicly named, on a felony charge once they were issued an arrest warrant.

The news comes after a seven-day campaign by conservative activists both at Berkeley and nationally, who have argued, on social media, right-leaning political websites and Fox News, that because of liberal bias, the attack garnered what they perceive as a delayed response from the police and university and a muted response from the public.

“Wonder if it would be the same if a conservative beat up a leftist on the Berkeley Campus?” President Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted Tuesday afternoon before news of the pending arrest. He shared the headline of a Fox News story: “Conservatives call out Berkeley police for lack of arrest one week after campus assault on activist.”

Jussie Smollett, “Empire” actor, claimed that on Jan. 29, two masked men identifying themselves as Donald Trump supporters and using racial and homophobic insults attacked him. Smollett said the assailants yelled “This is MAGA country,” bashed his face, crushed his ribs, splashed him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. Smollett’s telling of the hate crime was gobbled up hook, line and sinker by the anti-Trump news media, but Chicago police say it was a hoax. This type of hoax is part and parcel of the left’s broad agenda of victimology, fraudulence and gimmickry, plus gross media gullibility, incompetence and political attention seeking. What’s so troublesome is the fact that despite considerable evidence that the incident was a hoax, no apologies have been issued to either the public or the targets of their malfeasance — President Trump and the Americans who voted for him.

Racial hoaxes have been a major part of the leftist agenda going back decades. In 1987, the Rev. Al Sharpton created the Tawana Brawley hoax, wherein four white men were falsely accused of rape. For perpetrating the hoax, Sharpton was rewarded by receiving national recognition, millions of dollars and a career as a television/radio talk show host, and he ran for president in 2004. He also received 82 invitations to advise Barack Obama’s White House on matters of race.

Most of the nation’s racial hoaxes take place on college campuses. Recall the 2006 Duke lacrosse rape case, in which three affluent white male Duke students were falsely accused of raping a black female stripper. Police exposed Bowling Green State University student Eleesha Long as a liar after she complained about being attacked by Trump supporters the day after his election. At Goucher College in Maryland, scrawlings depicted swastikas and also spelled out the N-word and the names of four black students — including the perpetrator. The Maryland police found out that the perp was a 21-year-old black lacrosse player seeking victimhood. Nonetheless, the incident led to protests, demands for designated safe spaces and demands that incoming freshmen and transfers be required to take a “cultural competency” course.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has compiled some of the most outrageous hate crime hoaxes since Trump was elected. The hate crime hoaxes include claims of attacks on Muslim men and women by Trump supporters. A bisexual woman falsely claimed that Trump supporters were sending her nasty notes. Most of the hate crime hoaxes have been committed by black students. Their charges include the posting of KKK signs, the sending of racist notes and the writing of racist graffiti on a black person’s door with the words “Go Home N—– Boy” and “Whites Only.” A black man was caught on camera spray-painting doors and vehicles with racial slurs, vulgar words and swastikas.

Even professors create hoaxes. Indiana State University professor Azhar Hussain sent bogus anti-Muslim emails to himself, according to police, “trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself.” He was arrested for filing a false police report.

Here’s the good news about the racial hoaxes on the nation’s college campuses: Left-wing college students have a difficult time finding the actual racism they claim permeates college campuses. Thus, they have to invent it. Though it has not been proved yet, these students may have support for their racial hoaxes by diversity-crazed administrators, who nationwide spend billions of dollars on diversity and a multiculturalist agenda. Racial discord and other kinds of strife are their meal tickets.

Black people, as well as homosexuals, should condemn these hoaxes, but so far, most have remained silent. If police are right that Smollett’s claims were a dastardly hoax, it will cause doubt to be cast on future real claims of assault based on race and sexual orientation. It also will have a negative impact on race relations. This is not something to be taken lightly. If Smollett is found guilty of a felony as he is charged, he should suffer heavy penalties, including jail time. There’s a lesson to be learned from one of Aesop’s fables, “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.”

“You know I have been fighting for justice for Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos. They were put in a Collier County’s deputy’s car (inaudbile) Steve Calkin back- it’s almost been 15 years now and disappeared,” the 49-year-old actor shared during his appearance on the “Today” show when asked about the “Empire” star’s innocence or guilt in the case.

“So I wish that that case could have gotten half the attention that the Jussie Smollett thing got,” he added. “But listen everybody that knows, he’s adamant that he’s telling the truth.”(RELATED: ‘Good Morning America’ Has Robin Roberts Breaks Silence On Smollett Interview)

Perry continued, “Everybody that knows him that I know, they all say he’s not the type of person that’d ever do that. So, it’s pretty confusing.” (RELATED: Chicago Police Say ‘Empire’ Actor Refuses To Turn Over Phone Records)

“So right now it’s a wait-and-see,” the “Madea’s Family Reunion” star explained, before being pushed further by one of the hosts about if he thinks Smollett is telling the truth about not being involved in the alleged attack.

“Listen, he is so adamant about it,” the filmmaker responded. “And he’s so convincing in his story that I’m just hoping and standing with him hoping that it all turns out in his favor for sure.”

It comes on the heels of reports last week that Smollett was a suspect in the case after first telling police he was attacked near his home in Chicago on Jan 29. He alleged the suspects yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him. Smollett also told police that the alleged attackers threw a rope around his neck and threw a bleach-like substance on him.

At a press conference last week, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson blasted Smollett for allegedly staging the attack to “promote his career.”

“‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger to promote his career,” Johnson shared. “I am left hanging my head and asking, ‘Why? Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?'”

“‘How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?'” he added. “‘How can an individual who has been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?'”

The “Empire” star has maintained his innocence."

Perry also referenced the cases of Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos, two men who disappeared after allegedly being picked up by a Florida sheriff’s deputy 15 years ago.

“I’ve been fighting for justice for Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos … so I wish that that case could have gotten half the attention that the Jussie Smollett thing [got],” he said. “But listen, everybody that knows him — he’s adamant that he’s telling the truth. Everybody that knows him that I know, they all say he’s not the type of person that would ever do that. So it’s pretty confusing, so right now it’s a wait and see.”

Last week, Chicago police held a press conference in which they alleged Smollett paid $3,500 to stage a “bogus” attack against him to draw attention to himself because he was dissatisfied with his salary. (A source has denied to PEOPLE that Smollett had any sort of issue with his pay, saying, “There’s never been a dissatisfaction with his salary.”)

Smollett, who is black and gay, was arrested last week after turning himself in to police, one day after he was charged. He presented in bond court on Feb. 21, where a judge set his bond at $100,000; he was released after posting $10,000 bond. He has also been asked to surrender his passport. His next hearing is scheduled for March 14.

He’s facing a felony charge of disorderly conduct. If convicted, he could serve up to three years in prison.

Smollett has maintained his innocence. In a statement released by his attorneys after the press conference, the actor’s legal team said that “presumption of innocence … was trampled upon” in the Empire star’s case.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” the statement began. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Appearing on Good Morning America this week, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said there is “a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that does not support his innocence,” citing “physical [evidence], video and testimony.”"

CJR doesn’t break down the numbers. Instead, graphs are utilized to illustrate the trust gap, and as the graph below reveals, while CJR puts “the press” at second to last above “Congress,” it is the media who rank lowest when you add up “a great deal of confidence” and “only some confidence.” Moreover, the media are way ahead of everyone — law enforcement, the military, the Supreme Court, the executive branch — on the “hardly any confidence at all” ranking.

The “executive branch” is the presidency. Considering the unceasing lies and hate the media have thrown at President Trump for three years now, it must be a bitter thing to discover the American people have more confidence in an institution run by Trump than your own.

The reasons for this can be found in other numbers. Only ten percent of Republicans believe the media do not have a partisan bias. Incredibly, only 42 percent of Democrats believe the same.

The most revealing news in this poll of 4,214 adults comes in the form of this question: Do you believe reporters are paid by their sources? A whopping 60 percent of Americans said yes, including a majority of Democrats (54 percent) and more than two-thirds of Republicans (70 percent).

Think about that… This institution is so broken that a majority of both Republicans and Democrats believe reporters are paid by their sources. While I have always believed they sell their souls for free, who knows anymore? During the last decade, every other pillar of responsible journalism has been torn down by so-called journalists, and there have been reports about cash payoffs.

Keep in mind, though, that payoffs don’t only come in the form of money. How many so-called journalists have earned lucrative jobs at various Democrat political operations after years of offering those same Democrats favorable coverage?

What’s more, dozens of so-called reporters — literally, dozens — earned jobs in the Obama administration — an obvious payoff for glowing and unskeptical coverage.

The poll also shows that the public is finally wising up to the media’s use of anonymous sources, those unnamed people who, at least in the case of Trump, have been the most responsible for all the unceasing fake news about the president.

As of now, 41 percent of those polled said they are “less likely” to believe a story that uses anonymous sources, while only 36 percent said it makes no difference. That skepticism is very good news for America.

There is also terrible news for print newspapers and magazines: Only six percent said they use either as a news source. Meanwhile, 40 percent said they get their news from social media and the Internet, which ties with television.

Yep, alternative media are on the rise in terms of both readership and influence.

There is just no question the media have blown up all their credibility and moral authority in pursuit of their white whale, Trump. Those partisan and snarky tweets, the ludicrous fact-checking, and all the fake news…. My God, the fake news… The lies, the manufacturing of sources and events, and most of all, the media’s refusal to learn from their own scandals.

Every time the media are caught lying, they double down.

In just the last few months, we have witnessed this time and again.

After failing to destroy Brett Kavanaugh’s rise to the Supreme Court with lies about him being a serial rapist, the media doubled down with a phony story about Trump ordering his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to commit perjury. When that blew up in their smug faces, the media attempted to destroy the lives of the boys from Covington Catholic High School with provable smears. When that backfired, the media went all in on this Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax.

As I write this, media are treating a disbarred lawyer and convicted perjurer as Moses delivering truth on stone tablets.

The media will never change. They can’t; they’re boxed in now. The only way CNN and MSNBC and the Washington Post and the New York Times can survive is by holding on to their far-left base. Everyone else has walked away. The only customers these failed outlets have left are the ones who demand Russian conspiracy theories, bigotry, and hate against innocent Catholic boys, and the like.

It’s not about journalism anymore; it’s about doing whatever is necessary, no matter how dishonest, crazy, or damaging to a community like Ferguson, Missouri, to hang on to the only customers they have left.

Just days after Smollett was hospitalized, Page appeared on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, where she condemned the attack, expressed frustration with the way the media was covering it and suggested that such hate crimes were tied to the anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs and rhetoric of members of the Trump administration.

In her THR piece, Page did not directly address the recent developments in the Smollett case, including the actor’s arrest for filing a false police report (the Chicago Police believe Smollett staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on Empire). Instead, she focused on the very real violence that LGBTQ+ people face, starting with the story of two openly gay women who were physically and verbally harassed at a Seattle Seahawks game this past December.

“We, as LGBTQ+ people, are forced to fear for our safety because instances of hate violence, like the violence these women experienced in Seattle, happen,” Page said. “They happen to us all the time. It’s the fear that makes us pause before grabbing the hand of our loved one in public. It’s the fear that makes us consider whether or not we are in physical danger before we lean in for a kiss on the cheek.”

Page spoke about meeting survivors of hate crimes while making her docuseries, Gaycation, and noted that recent FBI crime data shows that hate crime in America have risen for three straight years. She also spoke about the psychological toll that hate speech has on members of the LGBTQ+ community, leading them to self-harm or to not report violence for fear of not being believed.

“I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists,” Page said. “The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told.”

On The Late Show With Stephen Colbert last month, Ellen Page blamed Mike Pence and the Trump administration for the rise in hate crimes — like the one supposedly perpetrated against Jussie Smollett. Today, in light of the allegations that Smollett planned the attack himself, Page penned an op-ed for The Hollywood Reporter to remind people that anti-LGBTQ+ violence is very prevalent and very real.

Page was one of the first to speak out vehemently in support of Smollett when news of the attack first broke, and her heated comments on Colbert were widely shared. Until today, Page had yet to speak out about the Smollett case since revelations that the attack might be fake. Smollett was charged with filing a false police report, and police now claim that he planned the attack himself.

In the letter, Page addresses the controversy directly, reminding readers that she had “no reason to doubt Jussie.” She also addresses what could happen if the Smollett hoax turns out to be true: “If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes.”

Page pledged to use her privilege and visibility to continue speaking out — and she’s been doing so recently. Earlier this month, Page called out Chris Pratt for attending what she called an “infamously” anti-LGBTQ+ church. (Pratt responded to the accusations with an Instagram Story, claiming his church was all about love.) Just last week, she opened up about Hollywood pressuring her to stay in the closet when she was in her early 20s."

It is fantastic to contemplate such a thing in the United States, which is fundamentally prouder of nothing than of its Constitution and the immense place that the system created by that Constitution and maintained these 230 years by recourse to interpretation and reassertion of it has played in the unprecedented rise of America from a loosely connected group of colonists numbering only a few million at independence to the overwhelming preeminence of the U.S.A. at the end of the Second World War. That preeminence has been substantially maintained since.

For at least 60 years I have heard high American officials announce that the United States is not a banana republic. Of course it is not, and never was. But there is a complacency about Americas status as a society of laws that is both unbecoming and unjustified. As many judges, lawyers, and commentators have noted, the level of prosecution success in criminal cases is over 95%, 97% of those without a trial; these, and the proportion of the population that is incarcerated, are totalitarian numbers.

Congressional investigations where there is no lawyer-client privilege, the ease of alleging and gaining convictions on charges of dishonest responses to the police, as well as press trials long before a defense has even been filed (as in the Jussie Smollett case, where the chief of police of Chicago has been garrulously babbling out the prosecution evidence); all of this is a Star Chamber. None of it would be admissible in any other serious common-law country, such as Great Britain, Canada, Australia, or Ireland.

Every nomination to the Supreme Court is now a pitched battle replete with paid demonstrators at hearings and extensive campaigns of character assassination, but that court has sat inert as practically all the Bill of Rights constitutional assurances of due process, prompt and impartial justice, and the avoidance of capricious prosecutions have been abandoned.

It is in this, as other civilized jurisdictions would consider it, tenuous state of the rule of law that the antics of the Comey-McCabe FBI and Brennan-Clapper intelligence direction, and their partisan effort to bend the law to install Hillary Clinton as president and sandbag Donald Trump, should be considered.

Celebrated as Thomas Jefferson rightly is for his seminal role in the creation of the countrys initial texts and its early governance, one achievement for which he has received insufficient credit is the founding in 1802 of the United States Military Academy at West Point. While this began as a corps of engineers limited to 20 men at first (led by Benjamin Franklins nephew, Jonathan Williams), the objective was to assure a non-political class of officers. The focus on engineering was, at this early stage, the young nations chief military requirement.

Jeffersons initiative assured the United States of a nonpolitical military. The country has had twelve presidents who were celebrated combat military officers, from Washington to Eisenhower, including citizen generals such as Jackson, Hayes, and Garfield. And it has had a number of presidents who were distinguished middle or junior officers, including Presidents Truman, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and George H. W. Bush, and six high-ranking military officers who were unsuccessful presidential candidates, including the first Republican candidate, Colonel John C. Frémont; a general fired by Abraham Lincoln as commander of the Army of the Potomac, George B. McClellan, who had the effrontery to run against Lincoln in 1864; and a hero POW, John McCain.

The point of this recitation is that none of these people dabbled in politics while they were in the armed forces. The only serious figure who did so was General Douglas MacArthur, who, in response to a freshet of Republican-delegate enthusiasm from a midwestern state while he was preparing to liberate the Philippines, wrote to a supporter for public circulation a letter stating that he would accept the Republican nomination in 1944, but would be unable to campaign (as if his commander-in-chief, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, would tolerate such a thing from a serving theater commander).

When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in 1952, and was asked when he became Republican, he replied: Today. No soldier has led Great Britain since Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century, except the Duke of Wellington, for two years.

The federal police (FBI) are another matter. The leader of a successful previous organization and of the FBI for a total of 47 years, J. Edgar Hoover, has been strenuously criticized for his unscrupulous political machinations, but he never attempted to influence a presidential election. When the military are depoliticized, the secret police and intelligence services, if not reined in, can be very powerful, in a democratic country as in a dictatorship.

In the Soviet Union, the army only briefly was politically influential, under Marshal Zhukhov just after the death of Stalin, while Stalins last three secret-police leaders, Yagoda, Yezhov, and Beria, were all summarily executed after they had done a great deal of his unimaginable dirty work. Even in revolutionary and Napoleonic France, the greatest police minister in all history, the egregiously cunning Joseph Fouché, who sent the head of the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre, to the guillotine at the end of the Reign of Terror, after Robespierre had tried to do the same to him, was sent packing finally, rich but mistrusted and powerless.

American democracy is insuperably strong in the hearts of the people and in 230 years of triumphant survival through a vehement and contentious national history. But the recent fantastic cascade of professions of righteous untouchability from Messrs. Comey and McCabe and Brennan and Clapper shows that there is no institutional tradition of respect for and deference to the constitutional integrity of the system in the main police and intelligence agencies.

Though fired for dishonesty and sent for grand-jury evaluation as a criminal lying to Congress and out of control, Andrew McCabe generally enjoys the support of the Trump-hating press in his book tour, celebrating a lawless disregard for the supremacy of the people under the Constitution. He feared that Mr. Trump might be a Russian asset, and accordingly set a special counsel with practically unlimited powers, who engaged a fervently partisan Democratic staff, upon him.

Almost the entire legal system of the United States requires radical reform and democratization, and the disarming of a virtually omnipotent prosecutocracy. It is the strength and the weakness of America that it is not really the gentle and kindly country portrayed by Norman Rockwell and Walt Disney.

That America exists and is a revered pastoral self-image. But the United States is ultimately a jungle, and jungles are ruled by 30-foot constricting snakes and 600-pound cats, and these are usually the rulers of America, with a varying level of humanization.

The intense struggle for the highest positions in the country is a generally meritocratic struggle, with only rare lapses into mediocrity. The survival and elevation process leaves an inordinate number of severely shattered people. In such a society, the senior police and intelligence apparatus can be dangerous, and in the last few years, it has been.

The outcome of the present struggle for power in Washington should include tighter civilian control of these agencies, as in the military, the end of the effort to criminalize policy differences, and the end of the attempted reduction of the drastic remedy of impeachment to a partisan power play to reverse the result of elections.

That is essentially what it was in the Nixon and Clinton presidencies and has been since the 2016 election. The United States has had a close call with something close to banana republicanism, and it must draw and apply the lessons of this turbulent time.

On Monday, an 18-year-old student was caught on video assaulting an underage Trump supporter at Santa Fe High School in Edmond, Oklahoma.

The underage student was wearing the iconic “Make America Great Again” hat and carrying a Trump banner.

The student’s pro-Trump apparel didn’t break any schools rules, according to the local Edmond Sun.

“On the 25th, students were allowed to contribute a dollar to the fundraising cause in exchange for a pass to wear headgear to school, which is typically not allowed in school facilities during the school day,” school spokeswoman Susan Parks Schlepp said in a statement.

Despite being perfectly within his rights to wear the Trump hat, the kid was confronted and assaulted by the older student, who is legally an adult. According to the Sun, Kenneth Dewayne Jones is named on the municipal court summons on an offense of assault and battery.

The video shows the younger student attempting to avoid a confrontation when the older student seemed to push him against the wall.

The student repeatedly demanded “take it off or I’ll rip it off.”

After the younger student refused to give in, the adult student knocked his hat off and grabbed the banner out of his hands.

“Take this s— off. Take this s— off,” the 18-year-old student yelled.

Thankfully, the belligerent leftist might see justice as the family considers pressing charges.

“At this time we are entertaining pursuing charges. I told my son I was proud of him, he handled the situation very well, he did not become aggressive, he stood his ground for what he believed in, but I was proud of him and I will always back him,” the young student’s father told KFOR-TV.

This encounter is an example of a real politically motivated assault, but it will get nowhere near as much attention as the apparent hate crime hoax crafted by actor Jussie Smollett.

There won’t be any tweets from Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker denouncing this awful attack like the sympathetic tweets made after the alleged attack on Smollett was first reported.

That’s because the recent string of attacks on Trump supporters is exactly what the left has been egging on since the president entered office.

This is the district's second major case regarding the mistreatment of queer student population, as, according to the ACLU of Minnesota which is handling the case alongside Gender Justice, the district was sued following the suicides of nine queer students over two years. The former lawsuit alleged the district ""allowed uncontrolled bullying and created unequal access to education.""

According to the complaint, shared by the ACLU and Teen Vogue, the student—referred to as N.H. for privacy—had transitioned socially prior to high school and upon entering high school in fall 2015, the staff seemed to be ""welcoming and supportive."" According to Twin Cities Pioneer Press, ""The teen's complaint says his teammates and swim coach supported him. School staff used his preferred name and pronouns, and the coach worked with him to decide what kind of swimsuit he'd wear.""

N.H. participated on the boys' swim team, and used the boys' locker room, through February 1 of 2016, when N.H. was pulled out of class and informed he would no longer be allowed to use the boys' locker room, and instead had to use a separate room of his own. He was hospitalized due to mental health concerns only four days later.

""Throughout the remainder of the 2016 school year, and during much of the 2017 school year, this degrading and stigmatizing segregation singled N.H. out as unfit to use the same changing facilities that are available to cis-gender male students,"" the complaint reads. ""N.H. was hospitalized again following a public debate during which the Board heard testimony from members of the public affiliated with hate groups, and ultimately his parents and care providers determined it was critical that he complete his high school education elsewhere.""

""The stakes in this case are high and all too real,"" Gender Justice executive director Megan Peterson said to the ACLU. ""Nearly three percent of Minnesota students identify as transgender or gender diverse,"" adding later, ""Transgender students are two to three times more likely to experience daily verbal and physical harassment, and more than half attempt suicide. As adults, we have an obligation to protect these kids."""

“The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath,” Page wrote in the column published Wednesday morning on the Hollywood website. “I had no reason to doubt Jussie.”

Smollett, a gay, black actor on “Empire,” alleged that he was the victim of a hate crime in late January. He claimed he was attacked by two white men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs and voiced support for President Trump.

Following an investigation, Chicago police determined Smollett staged a hoax attack and paid two black men to carry it out.

When Smollett's story first went public, many figures in Hollywood, politics, and the media jumped to his defense.

About two weeks after the alleged attack, Page appeared on ”The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert and encouraged people to ""connect the dots"" between the Trump administration, particularly Vice President Mike Pence, and the alleged attack on Smollett.

“The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife,” Page told Colbert. “If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street.”

Video of those emotional remarks got millions of views.

In the editorial, Page did not apologize for blaming the hate crime on Pence or her linking the alleged attack to the Trump administration.

Page, who is gay, said even though Smollett’s case was most likely not a true hate crime, she hopes people will not question other hate crimes in the future.

“The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face,” Page said. “This is the story that must be told.”"

Smollett claimed he was attacked by two men wearing Make America Great Again hats. He said the men attempted to put a noose around his neck and assaulted him while yelling, “MAGA country!” in the early hours of the morning last month.

A police investigation commenced and now Smollett has been charged with filing a false police report and disorderly conduct. Chicago police believe Smollett’s story was a hoax and that he paid two Nigerian brothers who had been extras on “Empire” to help him stage the attack.

The Chicago Police Department says this was all because Smollett wanted to “up” his public profile in order to get a larger salary on “Empire.”

Smollett denies these claims. But there is video footage of the Nigerian men buying masks and rope for a noose; and Smollett’s own account of the story has changed several times.

Page was one of many celebrities to immediately back Smollett’s story and use it as fuel to go after the Trump administration.

“The urgency is so severe, and yet we have a media that’s barely talking about it,” Page said in an interview with Stephen Colbert following the Smollett story. “We have a media that’s saying it’s a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd! This s*** isn’t a debate.”

Page then went on to tie the Smollett story to the Trump administration — and specifically Vice President Mike Pence and his stance on homosexual marriage.

“This is what happens,” she said. “If you are in a position of power, and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering — what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves. People are going to be beaten on the street.”

No matter how one feels about Pence or his positions, Page’s words were absurd. She was essentially saying Smollett was attacked because men like Pence encourage it through their words.

No matter how one feels about Pence or his positions, Page’s words were absurd.

Page was, of course, silent as more details about the Smollett case emerged. Many other celebrities who originally backed Smollett’s story also stayed silent — and continue to do so.

Now Page has addressed her interview with Colbert and her words on Smollett and Pence in a guest column for The Hollywood Reporter titled, “Hate Violence Is Not a Hoax.”

Page’s words in the article are even more embarrassing and myopic than her claims in the Colbert interview.

Not only did she not apologize for her rush to judgement or her strange attempt to connect Pence to Smollett — the Smollett case is only briefly mentioned. Page instead spent most of the column trying to change the narrative and prove that hate crimes are real.

What’s so odd about her written words is that no intelligent person is claiming hate crimes don’t exist following the Smollett case; people are instead rightly saying these hoaxes set us back and build narratives that harm real hate crimes.

“The conversation around Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath,” Page wrote when she finally got around to talking about Smollett — the piece opened with a story of a hate crime that took place in Seattle.

“I had no reason to doubt Jussie. My work on ‘Gaycation’ — the docuseries I produced to chronicle LGBTQ+ stories from around the world — introduced me to many survivors of hate violence. I know how prevalent and pernicious it can be. If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes.”

Page then went on to list some frightening statistics about suicide rates among young gay men and women. While those statistics are heartbreaking, Page simply used them as a way to distract from her own rush to judgment and the conversation that should be had about faking hate crimes and building a false narrative around the millions of Americans who voted for President Trump.

Nowhere in her column did Page apologize to Pence or the millions of Americans she helped to smear in her Colbert interview.

Her column was just the latest example of the refusal of elite Hollywood liberals to move outside of their own bubble and have a real conversation.

Prairie (Brit Marling) is alive after being shot in the part one finale. She wakes up in the hospital with her mind and body intact. She can still see, she knows what year it is (2016), but when she names Barack Obama as the president, she is met with confusion. This is because she has awoken in a different dimension. Apparently, she isn't even Prairie anymore, she's Miss Asarova. And all of her dancing comrades from Part I—Homer, Rachel, Scott, and Renata—are also completely different versions of themselves in this alternate reality. They are, though, aware of the change and in awe of the power of their dance. But they don't get to enjoy it because they have a missing person mystery to solve.

As she was promoting The Umbrella Academy, a “fired up” Page appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and blamed Mike Pence‘s policies for contributing to the normalization of homophobia that leads to hate crimes like the one that Smollett’s been accused by law enforcement of staging.

Following the unraveling of Smollett’s story over the past month, Page is now breaking her silence by penning a Hollywood Reporter column. It’s a lengthy piece in which she doesn’t dwell long on the investigation at hand but speaks to the damaging effects if Smollett’s attack was in fact faked. “[I]t could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes,” Page writes. “Very real crimes.” She continues while imploring the public to never lose sight of the conversation about hate crimes:

While the media and public debate the case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day. I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists. The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told.

Page points toward grim statistics to support her argument:

Hatred toward otherized people is institutionalized here and across the globe and reinforced by political rhetoric. FBI data released in 2018 shows reported hate crimes in America rose 17 percent the year prior, the third consecutive year of escalation. In fact, the most recent study from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs reported the deadliest year on record for the LGBTQ+ community. The statistics are plentiful and powerful and all point to a rising tide of hate violence.

The full column is well worth reading and can be found here. The Hollywood Reporter has also published an extensive profile of the now-suspended Empire actor that digs into his internal struggles, including depression, while exploring whether or not the pressures of fame contributed to his disintegrating situation. See the publication’s cover below.

Meanwhile, Smollett’s team maintains that they have evidence (including the $3,500 check that many consider to be a smoking gun) will actually disprove claims of a staged attack. His next Chicago court date will be on March 14.

He added to the Daily Californian that campus police will ""immediately"" pursue the suspect's arrest if the warrant is issued.

What's the background?



Hayden Williams — a field representative for the Leadership Institute, which trains conservative activists — was helping conservative student group Turning Point USA recruit members at UC Berkeley on the afternoon of Feb. 19.

Williams told Fox News' Sean Hannity that some Berkeley students got angry at Turning Point USA's recruitment table sign that read, ""Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims."" The network added that the group also had a sign that read, ""This is MAGA Country"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

The signs also referred to the controversy surrounding ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was arrested last week and accused by Chicago police of staging a fake hate crime against him — at the hands of Trump supporters — to advance his career.

Williams told Hannity the man who punched him claimed Williams and Turning Point were promoting violence — and then the culprit got violent himself, even threatening to ""shoot"" him, according to the video of the incident.

Here's the clip. ( Content warning: language):

The victim added to Hannity that he ""absolutely"" has evidence and eyewitnesses that he didn't provoke the attacker. Williams said, ""I feared for my own safety so I started to record at that moment,"" but he told Fox News the attacker knocked his phone from his hand; however, a bystander recorded video as well.

Then came the face punch — and a black eye for Williams.

$50,000 reward offered

Conservative group Citizens United Foundation is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the suspect's arrest and conviction, Fox News said.

""Any person having information related to this crime is requested to contact Citizens United Foundation at the following email address: BerkeleyThugReward@citizensunited.org,"" the reward offer said. ""In the email, please provide contact information and details of the information in your possession, including relevant facts. Any information provided will be promptly forwarded to the UC Berkeley Police Department.""

Conservatives speak out

Charlie Kirk — founder and executive director of Turning Point USA — was none too pleased with the seemingly slow response of UC Berkeley police.

""This is really surprising,"" Kirk told Fox News on Tuesday. ""From what I understand there's been no arrest. I don't understand why there's no public arrest file on this guy. If he had been wearing a Make America Great Again hat and had punched a liberal in the face there'd be nationwide outrage and a manhunt to find him. The whole thing is crazy.""

Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky called the incident ""abhorrent behavior against free speech on campus.""

Donald Trump Jr. wondered ""if it would be the same if a conservative beat up a leftist"" at Berkeley."

Spoilers below for True Detective season three.

“May memory restore again and again

The smallest color of the smallest day:

Time is the school in which we learn

Time is the fire in which we burn.”

That passage from the Delmore Schwartz poem, “Calmly We Walk Through This April’s Day,” figured prominently in Sunday’s third season finale of True Detective, and for good reason. While the most recent iteration of True Detective may technically be about a case of missing and murdered children, it was far more interested in exploring how memory restores (or erases) important details, and alters one’s understanding of the truth.

The HBO anthology series is one of several recent crime dramas, both fictional and non, that consider how faulty recollections can affect our understanding of a narrative. True Detective, the first season of The Sinner, Sharp Objects, and docuseries like Lorena to Leaving Neverland each pose the same question: “What has been forgotten or denied here, and what does that tell us about human nature?”

By the end of True Detective’s compelling third installment, it becomes clear that former Arkansas detectives Wayne Hays (Mahershala Ali) and Roland West (Stephen Dorff) have been looking at the unsolved 1980 death of Will Purcell and disappearance of Will’s sister, Julie Purcell, through a lens distorted by a string of misguided assumptions, as well as Wayne’s untrustworthy memory. The pursuit of the Purcell case unfolds over three timelines, including one set in 2015, when dementia has clouded Wayne’s brain and made his recollections about the 1980 investigation and the 1990 reinvestigation extra-foggy. Because Wayne acts as our primary window into this mystery, our sense of what happened to the Purcell kids is often as limited as his own.

Throughout the season, the directorial and editing choices convey the blurriness of Wayne’s memories, with moments from one timeline bleeding visually into another and visions appearing before him that may or may not be hallucinations. All of that calls into question the veracity of what Wayne thinks he knows. He’s a (mostly) honest man, but a terribly unreliable narrator. In the season finale, as the pieces of the Purcell puzzle finally fit together from our perspective, the visual timeline becomes even more frequently blurred: Just when it seems like we at last understand what happened to Will (whose death turns out to have been accidental), and Julie (who apparently died years after escaping captivity on the Hoyt estate), the episode suggests maybe we don’t.

During one of Wayne’s frequent hallucinatory conversations with his late wife, Amelia (Carmen Ejogo), she suggests that maybe Julie didn’t die at all and is instead living a happy life with her young daughter and husband, who once was the boy with an elementary-school crush on her. “What if,” Amelia asks, “there’s another story?” Ultimately True Detective never says whether Amelia’s theory is correct. When Wayne actually tracks down the woman who might be Julie, he has an episode and forgets why he’s driven to her house. The title of the finale, “Now Am Found,” which evokes the hymn “Amazing Grace,” could be a reference to Julie finally being found, or the notion that letting go of his quest for the truth, by choice or because of his illness, is the only way Wayne can find peace. Like so many modern crime stories, this one offers no solid resolution, but it does speak powerfully to the dance between denial, guilt, and forgetfulness that goes on when a person tries to sew up the loose ends of their past.

While it’s natural to connect this season of True Detective to previous ones, the show it most reminds me of is Sharp Objects. In that HBO limited series, Camille Preaker (Amy Adams) is not a detective, but she is a journalist investigating the murders of young girls in her Missouri hometown while also dealing with her own personal demons. Like Wayne’s issues, those demons are intertwined with the case she’s working. Camille doesn’t have dementia, but she is a raging alcoholic and an expert avoider of confronting family issues. The murky fluidity of her mental state is matched by the stream-of-conscious-style direction of Jean-Marc Vallée, which, as in True Detective, slides back and forth between Camille’s past and her present.

Sharp Objects is slightly less ambiguous than True Detective. By the time it’s over, we know how Camille’s sister Marian died years prior, and we know who’s responsible for the deaths of the girls in Wind Gap. It’s also clear that Camille knows all that, too. What we don’t know is how Camille will cope with what she’s learned. The mysteries may be resolved, but her work of adjusting, yet again, her grasp of her family’s dynamics — specifically those involving her mother, Adora (Patricia Clarkson) and her younger sister, Amma (Eliza Scanlen) — has only just begun. Her understanding of the story has changed again, one last time, as the credits roll.

The notion of memory informs other recent crime-dramas, including the first season of The Sinner, in which Jessica Biel plays a woman who kills a random stranger on a beach but can’t recall why she did it, and HBO’s The Night Of, which stars Riz Ahmed as an accused murderer who insists he’s innocent but, due to the use of drugs and alcohol, is unable to remember the moments that led to a woman winding up dead in his presence. While these two seasons of television tie up more neatly than Sharp Objects or the recent True Detective, they still present protagonists second-guessing their own realities, which highlights how suppressed memory and denial influences the way we interpret stories.

In a completely different way, Twin Peaks: The Return achieved something similar by activating the audience’s sense of nostalgia for the original series, then forcing them to consider the possibility of some other version of the Laura Palmer murder mystery. In the last two episodes in particular, co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost trafficked in alternate history, resurrecting footage from the original Twin Peaks pilot but reframing it without the body of Laura (Sheryl Lee), wrapped in plastic, and having Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) take a woman who looks exactly like Laura to the Palmer family home, only to find other people living there. This is Lynch and Frost’s way of asking the same question that was posed by Amelia in the True Detective finale: “What if there’s another story?”

A number of docuseries and true-crime shows have posed this question, too. Even though True Detective can be viewed as an indictment of the type of true crime that re-litigates seemingly unsolved murders, it shares something in common philosophically with nonfiction-based television that revisits high-profile incidents with the perspective born out of hindsight. Both seasons of American Crime Story retraced significant cases from the 1990s — the O.J. Simpson trial and the murder of Gianni Versace — but did so in a way that compelled us to reexamine them with sharper eyes and more nuanced analysis of key figures involved.

Lorena, the Amazon docuseries about Lorena Bobbitt, John Wayne Bobbitt, and the former’s famous removal of the latter’s penis in response to years of abuse, does the same thing. Twenty-five years later, a situation that once sparked more crass jokes than conversations about domestic abuse now tells a different, much deeper story about society’s warped relationship with masculinity and its propensity to disregard women who seem too “angry.”

When it debuts on HBO this weekend, I’m certain that Leaving Neverland, the already controversial docuseries about two men who say they were sexually abused by Michael Jackson throughout their childhoods, will also force many people to reconsider their feelings about the King of Pop. While it’s not the first time that underage sex-abuse allegations have been raised about the singer, it is the first time that these particular victims and their families have spoken at such great length about how Jackson groomed them. The two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, talk at length about how their love for Jackson was so deep and their shame so profound that it took years for them to fully process that they had been abused. (The Jackson family has denounced the allegations, and the late singer’s estate has sued HBO for $100 million.) It’s the kind of documentary that not only colors anew whatever perspective you held about Michael Jackson’s alleged pedophilia, but also forces a personal assessment of our relationships with his music — relationships that, for many of us, were born when we were around the same age as the boys who say they became victims.

What both Lorena and Leaving Neverland do, essentially, is turn us into Wayne Hays. As we watch, we’re the ones looking back at past criminal cases and trying to figure out what really happened. We’re the ones realizing we overlooked or forgot important details. We’re the ones comprehending that when it comes to abuse, be it spousal or child, the truth is sometimes terribly complicated and depressingly straightforward all in one breath.

Though it’s largely a product of coincidence, it’s interesting that these memory-driven crime shows are gaining so much cultural traction at a time when discussion of politics and current events — including real-life criminal quagmires, like the one involving Jussie Smollett — tend to devolve into arguments in which people on opposite sides contend they know “the real truth.” All of the series I’ve mentioned here imply that to figure out what the real truth is, you have to keep your mind open, acknowledge false assumptions, and realize that memories don’t always reflect actual reality.

True Detective and other memory-driven fare aren’t necessarily trying to teach us a lesson. But if there is one to take away, it’s embedded in that Delmore Schwartz poem: Time can be a school in which we learn to cast the past in unbiased light and revisit it with the enlightened perspective that years can be generous enough to provide, if we’re willing to accept it."

Countless people were stolen from their homeland and put into slavery—slavery that differed from the ancient world in that it explicitly and directly used race, not right of conquest, as the perceived validity of the institution. During Black History Month, I want to highlight some of the slave rebellions that have taken place across North America, South America, and the West Indies as a reminder that Black people, no matter where they were in the world, were not passive in the fight for their own freedom and emancipation. This is Freedom Friday.

But this time on a Wednesday.

Last week, everything that went on with the Jussie Smollett case (and is still ongoing) just left me in a state of malaise in which I wasn’t sure if I was going to finish out this series the way I’d wanted to, but a recent piece from FiveThirtyEight reminded me as to why I desired to talk about this subject in the first place.

They reported that a July 2018 survey “from the left-leaning Data for Progress found that 26 percent of Americans supported some kind of compensation or cash benefits for the descendants of slaves.” This survey was done in response to both Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris vaguely saying they were open to the idea of paying reparations to Black Americans “as restitution for slavery.” It’s an idea that is very unpopular but has been pushed into public consciousness again due to the writings of Ta-Nehisi Coates, in his 2014 essay “The Case for Reparations.”

Growing up with predominantly white educators until high school, my concept of reparations was formed by them and their idea that it didn’t make sense—a handout that would “demean” Black people. Other than that, it was something that I would hear referenced in comedy and treated with an air of delusion, even in Black areas, until Coates. However, it wasn’t until fairly recently that I’ve found myself radically Team Reparations, and it surrounds one country: Haiti.

The Haitian Revolution

As this is going to be a long post, I don’t want to bury the lede, so before we get into the blood and guts of the whole thing here, for the TL;DR crowd: Despite winning their freedom, the people of Haiti were required to pay the equivalent of $21 billion dollars in today’s money, under duress by France, which was a massive economic hinderance. They became independent in 1804; they didn’t pay off the debt until 1947. Now, let’s go back to the beginning.

To just lay out the scope of things, the Haitian Revolution has a lot of historical importance for a number of reasons: It was the reason the United States got the Louisiana Purchase from France, was the largest slave uprising since Spartacus’s, challenged of the Western ideas about the innate inferiority of Black people, and showed Black people enslaved across the world that they could fight and win against their oppressors.

That’s why Europeans were so quick to put them in their place.

Slavery in the Carribean was a cruel, often short life, where you were worked to death and then replaced with new enslaved peoples from Africa at the drop of a hat due to diseases, such as malaria and yellow fever, causing high mortality.

In 1787 alone, the French imported about 20,000 slaves from Africa into Saint-Domingue (Haiti), while the British imported about 38,000 slaves total to all of their Caribbean colonies. At least 50% of the slaves from Africa died within a year of arriving. This, in the eyes of the French, made Black people nothing more than beasts of burden to be used up until there was nothing left and the ocean could take them. Slaves also had no legal rights, so for Black women, rape by masters, their unmarried sons, or white overseers was a common occurrence on plantations.

The cruelty continued in severe punishments that rivaled other places in the slaveholding Empires. Whenever a slave left the plantation or disobeyed their masters, they were subjected to whippings or torture in the forms of castration or burning, both as a personal lesson and as a threat for other slaves who greatly outnumbered the white population.

This happened despite weak attempts from the Royals back in France to attempt to regulate that type of violence. Without the power to actually enforce such policies, most of the codes in the “Code Noir” to protect slaves were broken constantly.

And then the French Revolution began. The National Assembly made some radical changes in French laws and published the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which declared all men free and equal—then someone mentioned the slaves. In a genuine twist, the French National Assembly actually did agree to end slavery and abolished slavery in French colonies abroad.

Yay.

Oh, but when Napoleon took over, he brought back slavery because of his wife, Marie Josèphe Rose Tascher de La Pagerie, or as I like to call her, Jo—the daughter of slave owners who didn’t want to drop in the tax bracket. Vive La Révolution.

I’m sure, at this point, you’re waiting for an important name to come up: François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture. Toussaint Louverture, despite the lack of fully accurate birth records, is assumed to have been around fifty years old when led the Revolution in Haiti.

He was born a slave but became a free Black man in his thirties, educated enough to read and write on his own. During his time as a free man, he was said to have amassed a bit of wealth for himself on the island—not exactly the usual trappings of a revolutionary.

In May 1791, after the white slave owners refused to recognize the freedom of the slaves as laid out by the French National Assembly, the seeds of the rebellion began to take place, and when the signal to fight was raised by slaves on 14 August, the Haitian revolution began in earnest.

I don’t want to get into the full military history of the Haitian revolution and its twists and turns. I made sure to leave a full-throated list of sources down below for all your needs, but I’ll just pick some of the important things that are worth discussing.

So initially, the goal of Black Haitians wasn’t even to be independent of France. They just wanted the Freedom that had already been given to them through the National Assembly. Under the military leadership of Toussaint Louverture, the forces he commanded, of mostly of former slaves, ending up winning against both the British and Spanish forces that had come to the island during the revolution, and Louverture actually gave a lot of power back to France.

It wasn’t until 1801 that he circulated a constitution for Saint-Domingue that called for black autonomy and a sovereign black state.

Napoleon was not a fan and sent forces to Saint-Domingue with the secret mission to restore slavery. The French thought they would return to the island and all the Black would be excited to go back to slavery because it was “their natural state,” and they were really shocked that the Black people hated them so much. *Deep sigh.*

Despite their attempts, the French did not succeed, with most of their troops dying from yellow fever and the rest being hospitalized, including one of their commanders. The man who replaced him was the Vicomte de Rochambeau, and he wanted to essentially commit genocide against the black Haitian people. He drowned so many people in the water that men wouldn’t want to eat the fish there because they’d have feasted on human flesh.

Eventually, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the man who took up after Louverture was killed, defeated Rochambeau, and on 1 January, 1804, Dessalines officially declared independence and renamed the island “Haiti” after the indigenous Arawak name.

The Haitian Revolution was brutal, as was the aftermath. It’s no surprise that a people who had spent their lives brutally enslaved and had to deal with thousands of violent deaths on their side would then have a brutal way of handling their independence. The 1804 Haitian massacre of the white population of the island colored the way the United States would see the idea of freeing slaves, for fear of the violence that would come their way.

George Washington found the news about the slave revolt in Haiti “lamentable,” and it’s no wonder why. The revolt in Haiti and its independence, the rage that it came from, was a beacon to every Black person living under the lash. The Haitian Revolution inspired slaves across the diaspora to revolt for their freedom, and that is what made Haiti so dangerous.

In 1825, France arrived on the shores of Haiti with warships at the ready. France demanded Haiti compensate France for its loss of slaves and its slave colony. Therefore, in exchange for the French accepting Haiti as a sovereign republic, France demanded payment of 150 million francs and that Haiti discount its exported goods to them by 50%.

It took Haiti 122 years, to pay off both the original ransom and the “tens of millions more in interest payments borrowed from French banks to meet the deadlines.” This bleeding of the country is how Haiti went from producing 60% of the world’s coffee and 40% of the world’s sugar imported by France and Britain in 1789, the wealthiest and most prosperous colony of all the colonies in the Caribbean, to one of the poorest nations on Earth.

The economic instability helped create the political instability, with Haitians having endured more than 30 coups and a series of dictatorships, all the while giving money to their former owners through two World Wars.

Haiti has asked for reparations from France, but the chances of that happening are slim to none.

As a Global Research article asked in 2013:

“Europeans and North Americans regularly dismiss demands for reparations, saying the crimes of slavery and colonialism were committed by their ancestors. If we accept the logic that responsibility for these crimes does not belong to the current generation, then we must also conclude that the great wealth reaped from those crimes—which facilitated Europe’s and North America’s primitive accumulation of capital and world dominance today—should also not belong to the descendants of slave-owners and colonists. “Why couldn’t and shouldn’t the billions now spent on policing, intimidating, and repressing the Haitian people be invested in the Haitian police, agriculture, education, and healthcare? This is what most Haitians ask today.”

The conversation about reparations is not going anywhere, because as we talk about economic equity, especially on the progressive left, there is no way to avoid the topic. If the British government could give payouts to slaveowners for their loss of property, why are they not compelled to help build up or give some sort of economic restitution to the islands they created to bring them wealth?

If France, with the 6th largest economy in the world, could economically violate Haiti for 122 years, why are they not accountable for reparations? If Black Americans built this country and have had to deal with systematic inequality from the boats to the present day, why is it unreasonable to give them reparations?

It’s because, in the eyes of many, slavery is not something with far-reaching socio-economic repercussions for modern-day Black people. It’s just history.

Haiti was free of its economic debt to France seventy-two years ago. In perspective, Bernie Sanders was around five years old when Haiti paid it off. Joe Biden was four. Donald Trump was born the same year. This is not history; this is within the lifetimes of people who are around today.

I put all of this out there to illustrate that the discussion about reparations is not only important, but it is also fair when talking about economic equity. I have no delusions that this will change the majority of people’s minds. Still, I hope it gave you some food for thought.

Do you hear the people sing?

Singing the song of angry men?

It is the music of the people

Who will not be slaves again!

When the beating of your heart

Echoes the beating of the drums

There is a life about to start

When tomorrow comes!

There's no doubt that taking your brows from your natural color to platinum, barely there shade is a look—and one that only the daring tend to take. But after we gushed over the brows at Alexander Wang's Fall 2019 Collection showing, where all of his girls—including Kaia Gerber—had theirs bleached on site, we're suddenly all itching to try this look out for ourselves.

But much like with making the decision to change the hair on your head, there are a lot of things to know and consider before you go ahead and bleach your brows. Like how often they will need to be touched up, and the risks that come along with DIYing it—but also, just how easy it is to fix if you ultimately decide it's just not a look for you.

We chatted with colorists and bleach experts Hannah Edelman (otherwise known as Hannah The Painter) of Brush In Hand Hair Studio and Julia Elena of Hairstory to get the lowdown on all you need to know before taking the leap. Get the full scoop, below.

Anyone can pull off bleached brows if done right (and worn with confidence)

Edelman splits brow bleaching into three major categories based on intensity. The first (and least intense) category is a shift, which is a subtle lightening—usually one shade lighter—ideal for someone who colors their hair a shade or two lighter than their natural. Next is the medium category, which she describes as a ""bleach and tone,"" which is a two-step process that involves a lightener and a demi-permanent color. The third, the most intense and extreme, is the full bleach out—which is the edgy look we saw at Alexander Wang.

With that said, all levels of intensity can work on all skin tones and hair colors, as brows can be toned to flatter your skin's undertones. ""As a general rule of thumb, your brows should match your hair's base color, aka the darkest shade of your hair,"" says Edelman. ""If your natural color is much darker than your base color, bumping your brows lighter will create a more cohesive and convincing overall look.""

However, if a full bleach is what you're going for, you can throw all rules out the window, according to Edelman. ""[The wearer] doesn't care about the rules. It's a bold, in-your-face, on-your-face look carried by the wearer's badass confidence.""

Be aware that you will get attention with this look

While we can all agree that bleached brows are a fun look to try out, Elena wants you to keep in mind that they also come with a bit of vulnerability. ""You're exposing your face to something non-conforming after all, so you do need to be ready for that when you decide to bleach your brows.""

You can achieve your desired look in just one session

Unlike trying to bleach your head from chocolate brown to platinum blonde—which can sometimes require multiple, spaced-out sessions—you can achieve the alien brow look of your dreams in just one session, according to Elena. ""Usually, I bleach the brows in one session, and sometimes I may need to reapply for a bit depending on the original brow color."" Easy, peasy.

Keep in mind, brows grow fast

After you bleach your brows, Elena points out that you'll begin to see your roots in just one week, and you'll see your natural color coming back in about two. Your brows will likely need to be touched up more often than you touch up your regular hair color if you dye or bleach it, too.

Go to a professional

While some bleach aficionados might want to DIY a bleached brow at home, Edelman suggests going to a professional—especially if you're going for the full bleach out. ""A carefully applied brow shift can be done at home, but I would defer to a professional in any other case,"" she says. ""I am going to give you a Jewish mother spiel: the risks are real! Your skin could have adverse reactions such as blistering, bleeding, and/or bruising. You could accidentally get the product in your eye. With any at-home lightening sesh, there is a possibility of severely damaging your hair.""

Elena agrees—warning that, gulp, far scarier results can occur: ""In an extreme case, you can lose your brows altogether if the bleach is left on too long."" Nobody wants singed brows or a blistery forehead, so take their advice and seek the skills of a professional.

However, if you really trust yourself enough to DIY it (and aren't trying to go more than a shade or two lighter), make sure you protect your skin. ""Apply a petroleum jelly base around your brows to protect your forehead and sensitive eyelid,"" says Edelman. ""Place small pieces of foil over your eyebrows while they're processing. Also, try using a lightener that contains coconut oil, such as Pravana, to help soothe and protect your skin.""

Don't worry if you end up hating them

So, you decided to go for it and decide it's just not for you—no need to panic, they are easily fixable according to Edelman. ""You have options,"" she says. ""After a shameful Insta story, a few minutes of demi-permanent color will put your brows back to where you want 'em. Be nice and put a little conditioner on them, too.""

Elena kids that if you hate them, you can just shave them—but, no, really, she points out that you can tone them back to your original color or even try a different color should you feel adventurous. ""Just remember, you can always have your brows back if you don't like the bleached look.""

So, if you happen to find yourself bleached brow-curious, you might as well give it a whirl."

The Jussie Smollett saga continues as more reported evidence seems to be complicating the case EVEN MORE.

According to The Blast, one of the brothers who allegedly staged Jussie Smollett‘s homophobic and racist attacks has a history of homophobic statements.

The site pulled up old tweets allegedly made by brother Ola Osundairo chastising another Twitter user for liking Frank Ocean.

Back in March of 2013, Twitter user @JuiceMan3k, who is reported to be Ola, tweeted at a friend, writing, “Why you following Frank Ocean … you know that ni**a gay right.”

Another tweet from a few months earlier read, “YOU’RE GAY THATS WHO YOU ARE,” although it’s not clear who this tweet was directed at.

Less than 24 hours after The Blast exposed these tweets, the content has now been deleted, which could be a bad move for the prosecution’s case.

When news hit that the Nigerian-American brothers Ola and Abel could have helped Jussie stage an attack, they told CBS Chicago “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

These past tweets could debunk the brothers’ deceleration that they’re not homophobic. The tweets could also be a pivotal part in the case. A source close to the case told The Blast that deleting the tweets could be viewed as intentional destruction of evidence and “there could be severe ramifications.”

“We have a media that’s saying it’s a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd. It isn’t a debate,” Page told Colbert and millions of viewers.

“It feels impossible to not feel this way now with the president and Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married,” she continued. “Let’s be clear. The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. … He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana, and I think the thing we need to know and I hope my show Gaycation did this in terms of connecting the dots in terms of what happened the other day to Jussie, I don’t know him personally, I send all of my love.”

“Connect the dots,” she said. “This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?”

This is, of course, utter nonsense, particularly after new evidence has led authorities to arrest and charge Mr. Smollet for filing a false police report, allegedly paying two African American men to stage the attack on him.

With all this new information, surely Ms. Page is sorry for jumping to conclusions, sorry for telling millions of Americans that Pence is responsible for the attack because of his Christian faith, right?

Wrong.

In fact, in her first time speaking out with regard to Smollett since the new revelations in the case, Page doubled-down on her activism and acknowledged her own “privilege” as a “white cisgender woman,” but notably left out any apology for perpetuating the apparent hoax on national TV, nor did she offer any apology to Mr. Pence.

“The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath. I had no reason to doubt Jussie,” said Page, writing a guest column at The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday. “If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes,” she added.

“While the media and public debate the case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day,” she implored. “I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists. The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told.”

Concerning her own “privilege,” Page said she “must speak.”

“To the extent that my visibility and experiences can give voice to others who don’t share my privilege and opportunity — and because I take the trust and platform I’ve been given so very seriously — I must speak,” wrote the actress. “As a queer but white cisgender woman, I benefit from the protections and safety that my income and status afford me,” she said, though Page noted that she has not personally “escaped the threats of violence and the very real acts of violence and harassment that threaten and endanger our community and other underrepresented people.”

Page then stressed that religious leaders, the media, and politicians all help to advance the persecution of LGBT folks.

“When the rhetoric we read and the hate speech we hear comes from our politicians, our media and entertainment, our neighbors and families and our religious leaders, we internalize the pain in damaging, self-defeating ways,” she wrote. “We are wary and afraid to report hate violence.

I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists. The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told. … When the rhetoric we read and the hate speech we hear comes from our politicians, our media and entertainment, our neighbors and families and our religious leaders, we internalize the pain in damaging, self-defeating ways. We are wary and afraid to report hate violence. We lose hope as we continue to be victimized. The cruelty, the hate and the words manifest shame.

In the article, she fails to apologize for her role in casting blame on Donald Trump and Mike Pence for the “attack” on Empire actor Jussie Smollett, that Chicago police now believe was staged by the actor himself.

Following the hoax attack, the Juno actress appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and blamed the Trump administration for the hoax attack. Many Hollywood celebrities also blamed Trump and his supporters for the “attack.”

“The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife,” the 32-year-old said.

“If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street!”

Page even defended Smollett personally, saying, “We have a media that says it’s a debate that whether or not what happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd. Its not a fucking debate.”

That interview, posted on Colbert’s YouTube page under the title, “Ellen Page Calls Out Hateful Leadership,” went viral."

As if to prove just how utterly useless she is as a so-called journalist, Roberts only now is saying that there were “a lot of red flags” in Smollett’s claim he was the victim of a hate crime at the hands of two white Trump supporters armed with a noose and bleach who were out hunting for blacks and gays in downtown Chicago at 2 a.m. in subzero weather.

“Even though that you all were saying early on there was no reason not the believe his story, there were a lot of red flags, that a lot of people saw of people saw. You all had questions. Even though weren’t, of course, going to be public about that,” Roberts said during an interview with Chicago’s superintendent of police Eddie Johnson earlier this week.

Now you tell us, Robin!

Now you tell us you were skeptical of the story, because when you were the only journalist in America who interviewed Smollett, you expressed no skepticism at all. In fact, you didn’t even use the word “alleged” to describe the crime.

Her excuse for her irresponsible softball interview is even worse.

After the hoax blew up and Smollett was arrested and indicted for filing a false report, Roberts said this with a straight face: “We have to remember, at that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent. It was credible. And that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday and then we found out about the brothers.”

Oh, so the media are now believing the police, are taking everything the police tell them as gospel, are setting aside their own skepticism and doubts, their own professional responsibilities, to defer to law enforcement.

When did this rule change happen?

When did the abdication of independence and every tenet of professional journalism occur?

That is not only a terrible and revealing excuse coming from Roberts, it is also not true. When the agenda suits their left-wing cause, the media are always willing to express doubts about what law enforcement tells them. This is merely a handy shield for Roberts to hide her own biases and cowardice behind.

Jussie Smollett is black and gay, he claimed to be the victim of an attack at the hands of white Trump supporters, and as laugh-out-loud ludicrous as his story was from day one, just like the rest of the media, Roberts wanted that lie out there.

What’s more, were she in fact a journalist — as opposed to a left-wing propagandist, had she actually questioned Smollett in the same way she would a Trump supporter who claimed he was beat on by Antifa or some other left-wing sacred cow, it would have cost her with her establishment media confederates, who were just as invested in keeping the Smollett lie alive, who were just as skeptical as her but chose to cover up that skepticism until it no longer mattered.

This entire affair has exposed Roberts as unreliable, dishonest, and cowardly.

Also, she probably didn’t want to risk losing another opportunity to appear on Smollett’s hit show Empire, like she did last year without disclosing that conflict of interest.

When 60 percent of the public believe journalists are paid by their sources, they don’t just mean cash payoffs; they mean payoffs like the opportunity to appear on a hit series.

There is more than one way to buy a journalist.

""The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath,"" Page wrote in a guest column in The Hollywood Reporter.

Page, the star of big-screen hits ""Juno"" and ""Inception,"" does not address the latest Smollett developments in the column.

On Feb. 1, she condemned what she believed was a hate crime against Smollett during an appearance that went viral on CBS ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert's program.

""The urgency is so severe, and yet we have a media that’s barely talking about it,” Page said at the time. “We have a media that’s saying it’s a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd! This shit isn’t a debate.”

(AP) - In a story Feb. 26 about a Michigan transgender, gay rights activist charged with arson, The Associated Press reported erroneously that police said the man tried to fabricate a hate crime by setting his home on fire. The FBI initially investigated the arson as a possible hate crime but police have not provided a motive.

A corrected version of the story is below:

Gay rights activist accused of setting own home on fire

Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist set his own home on fire

JACKSON, Mich. (AP) - Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist charged with arson set his home on fire in an incident initially investigated by the FBI as a possible hate crime, but the man's attorney is questioning the evidence.

Attorney Daniel Barnett said the evidence is circumstantial and doesn't provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Nikki Joly set the August 2017 fire that killed five pets at his home in Jackson.

The 54-year-old Joly was charged last year with first-degree arson. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court, The Detroit News reported.

""We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,"" Elmer Hitt, Jackson's director of police and fire services, said Monday. ""We investigated it over what probably was a year's time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.""

MLive.com obtained the arson investigation report that says gas station surveillance video shows Joly buying gasoline the day of the fire and traces of gasoline were found on his clothes. Phone records and witness statements show Joly was home around the time the fire was set, the report said.

""The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being seen,"" police detective Aaron Grove wrote in the report.

Hitt declined to provide a potential motive for the arson. Barnett said the lack of motive causes doubt in the prosecutor's case.

""It doesn't make sense,"" Barnett said. ""(Joly) was citizen of the year.""

A local newspaper selected Joly as Jackson's citizen of the year in 2018. Joly helped open the city's first gay community center, organized its first gay pride festival and helped pass a nondiscrimination ordinance.

Chicago police last week charged the black and gay ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting a racist and homophobic attack."

They happen to us all the time,” the actress and LGBTQ activist wrote in a guest column for The Hollywood Reporter.

Page addressed allegations that Smollett, an actor on Fox’s “Empire,” orchestrated a fake attack last month in Chicago. Smollett told police that two masked men yelled racial and homophobic slurs, beat him up, tied a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him.

After a monthlong investigation, Chicago police charged the actor with filing a false report and said he staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.”

“The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath. I had no reason to doubt Jussie,” Page continued, adding that through her recent work on her TV docuseries “Gaycation” she has met many survivors of hate crimes.

“I know how prevalent and pernicious it can be,” she added. “If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes.”

Hate crimes, like the one Smollett said happened to him, are on the rise: The FBI reported last year that hate crimes increased 17 percent from the year before.

“While the media and public debate the case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day,” Page wrote.

People of color are disproportionately victimized by hate violence. In 2017, the country’s population was 13 percent black, while 28 percent of all hate crime victims were black. LGBTQ people, especially trans women of color, are at a greater risk as well. Twenty-nine transgender people were murdered in 2017, the deadliest year on record for the community.

Page added that Smollett’s story, whether true or not, does not change the very real violence that members of marginalized communities experience every single day.

“I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists,” she wrote. “The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question.”

Out of interest, I sat in.

The students, mostly around eighteen, seemed horrified by my friend’s apparent incompetence when she asked sincerely how they can know, for example, whether the world is round rather than flat.

Instead of thinking that the question might be deeper than it appears, the students presumed that my friend was one of those flat-earth enthusiasts who lurk online, or that she simply hadn’t done her due diligence.

The bravest of them vocalised these thoughts with a note of horror in his voice – “haven’t you researched this?” he asked shrilly. “Haven’t you read about this? It’s easy to know that the Earth is not flat – just look into it.”

The line between knowledge and belief is now blurrier and more undulating than at any point

Of course, my friend does not think the world is flat; she was attempting to get the students to think about what is actually involved in knowing something. ”Who in this room,” she enquired, “has empirically tested the hypothesis for themselves?”

No one answered in the affirmative. “The person who can prove the hypothesis knows in a way that I don’t,” she went on. “I’m not a scientist, so I take it on authority that they are right, but if knowing something entails fully understanding it, or being able to prove it, then I suppose I don’t know. Do you?”

The young man in the front who had spoken up earlier looked a bit perturbed.

The line between knowledge and belief is now blurrier and more undulating than at any point during my lifetime, and likely will be for a good deal longer than that. We rely on authorities to tell us or to reinforce what we know or should know, and sometimes what we should believe, but facts seem more ubiquitous and less delineated than ever.

The fact that there is a bizarre online movement of people who truly believe that the Earth is flat attests to that.

As a writer, I want to write about events in the world, and if I want to pay my bills, such writings are far more likely to find an interested publisher when those events are at their peak in the news cycle. However, I find myself more and more reluctant to participate in a social media cycle that seems increasingly rushed and overconfident about what is known.

In the last several weeks, we have seen Empire actor Jussie Smollett understandably sympathised with and supported all over social media and in papers when news emerged that he had been the target of a racially motivated attack.

It instantaneously spawned unreserved and furious public statements on what the incident said about the state of America today, until increasing evidence indicated that Smollett had lied about the attack.

Reflected through a lens of signalling and emotion, the truth can change shape

Not just deeply immoral, this is a heinous inflammation of bigotry on all sides at a delicate time for race relations in the US. Very little sympathy endures for people who falsely claim the special treatment afforded to victims of serious crimes like the one alleged.

Such people drain resources which should go to those who are legitimate victims, but they also impose on and disrespect the collective good will of society in a way which many find difficult to forgive.

It seems evident, given the number of recent examples in the news in which events or situations first appear one way, and then turn out (as most things usually do) to be more complex in reality, that the best response when consuming and contributing to online content is to slow down and wait for more information.

Sympathy for victims is appropriate, but we could also be generally more charitable – not just toward victims and those who are perceived as victims, but to the fallibility of human interpretation and understanding.

Reflected through a lens of signalling and emotion, the truth can change shape. It takes mindful awareness to protect our humanity and that of others, not to lash out, and to think about what it is to know something."

But, she has effectively said to hell with all that. In 2017, Ayorinde played a villainous Instagram model and mistress in the biggest movie of the summer: Girls Trip. Though she could have easily been typecast into this kind of role, Ayorinde resisted this, because of her commitment to fight for depictions of diversity among Black women. Never mind that Ayorinde is so stunningly beautiful that even if she stole any partner of mine, I wouldn't even be mad about it. She is so much more than just her looks; Ayorinde is in the fight. Which is why, this year alone, she appeared as the estranged daughter of Mahershala Ali on HBO's True Detective. She is also appearing as Dana in NBC's new NYC-based feel-good drama, The Village. But perhaps most importantly, Ayorinde will play a pivotal part in retelling the life of the slave, revolutionary, and abolitionist Harriet Tubman. After making a very deliberate decision early in her career to never be put in a box, it's all paying off for Ayorinde.

Born in London to Nigerian parents, Ayorinde's family moved to the Bay Area, where she took acting classes and piano lessons. Even as a kid, Ayorinde knew exactly what she wanted to do. ""I knew I wanted to be a professional performing artist—obviously I didn't use those words—but knowing that I would be an entertainer when I was growing up was kind of a no-brainer,"" she tells me. ""I was really serious about it."" She was so serious that she got an agent in New York while she was still an undergraduate at Howard University in Washington, D.C. ""I would go back-and-forth between New York and D.C. for auditions and then come back to class like nothing happened,"" she says.

This college hustle paid off. Ayorinde played nearly a dozen small roles before she snagged a regular part in Netflix's Luke Cage, where she played alongside two-time Academy award winner Mahershala Ali for the first time. About Ali, Ayorinde says, ""He's just so genuine, and he has such a big heart. And you can just tell on set everyone just really truly enjoys working with him and enjoys his energy."" But Ali isn't the only accomplished actor she's had the pleasure of working with. In Girls Trip, she was in the company of industry veterans like Regina Hall, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and Queen Latifah, who all let loose behind the scenes in addition to their onscreen shenanigans. Unsurprisingly, it was on this set that Ayorinde learned a valuable lesson about being an actor: Don't take yourself too seriously. ""For me to watch these heavy hitters just have such a great time and be so down-to-earth, it really really inspired me, and it's something that I'll never forget,"" she says. ""I've taken it to other jobs that I've done after that one.""

I don't think it's hard for Ayorinde to find laughter and joy, though. She openly describes herself as ""a chicken,"" with a laugh. Her personal watch-list includes Sex and the City;Soul Food (the series, not the movie) reminds her of her own sisters, and she appreciates classic Black movies like Coming to America and Harlem Nights. A natural light-heartedness is on full display throughout our conversation, and I find myself wondering how the hell she pulled off a stint on True Detective, known for its really dark undertones, and what it will be like for her to help tell the true story of Harriet Tubman, which is inspirational, of course, but not exactly pleasant.

Though she can't give specific details on the biopic yet, Ayorinde will be playing someone ""integral"" to Tubman's life who, as far as Ayorinde knows, has never been portrayed on film or television. Looking back on her experience shooting it, she shares: ""It made me look at myself, and make sure I'm walking in my purpose, and doing what I'm supposed to do to make the world a better place."""

Smollett said the assailants yelled “This is MAGA country,” bashed his face, crushed his ribs, splashed him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. Smollett’s telling of the hate crime was gobbled up hook, line and sinker by the anti-Trump news media, but Chicago police say it was a hoax. This type of hoax is part and parcel of the left’s broad agenda of victimology, fraudulence and gimmickry, plus gross media gullibility, incompetence and political attention seeking. What’s so troublesome is the fact that despite considerable evidence that the incident was a hoax, no apologies have been issued to either the public or the targets of their malfeasance — President Trump and the Americans who voted for him.

Racial hoaxes have been a major part of the leftist agenda going back decades. In 1987, the Rev. Al Sharpton created the Tawana Brawley hoax, wherein four white men were falsely accused of rape. For perpetrating the hoax, Sharpton was rewarded by receiving national recognition, millions of dollars and a career as a television/radio talk show host, and he ran for president in 2004. He also received 82 invitations to advise Barack Obama’s White House on matters of race.

Most of the nation’s racial hoaxes take place on college campuses. Recall the 2006 Duke lacrosse rape case, in which three affluent white male Duke students were falsely accused of raping a black female stripper. Police exposed Bowling Green State University student Eleesha Long as a liar after she complained about being attacked by Trump supporters the day after his election. At Goucher College in Maryland, scrawlings depicted swastikas and also spelled out the N-word and the names of four black students — including the perpetrator. The Maryland police found out that the perp was a 21-year-old black lacrosse player seeking victimhood. Nonetheless, the incident led to protests, demands for designated safe spaces and demands that incoming freshmen and transfers be required to take a “cultural competency” course.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has compiled some of the most outrageous hate crime hoaxes since Trump was elected (http://tinyurl.com/y2xcc3co). The hate crime hoaxes include claims of attacks on Muslim men and women by Trump supporters. A bisexual woman falsely claimed that Trump supporters were sending her nasty notes. Most of the hate crime hoaxes have been committed by black students. Their charges include the posting of KKK signs, the sending of racist notes and the writing of racist graffiti on a black person’s door with the words “Go Home N----- Boy” and “Whites Only.” A black man was caught on camera spray-painting doors and vehicles with racial slurs, vulgar words and swastikas.

Even professors create hoaxes. Indiana State University professor Azhar Hussain sent bogus anti-Muslim emails to himself, according to police, “trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself.” He was arrested for filing a false police report.

Here’s the good news about the racial hoaxes on the nation’s college campuses: Left-wing college students have a difficult time finding the actual racism they claim permeates college campuses. Thus, they have to invent it. Though it has not been proved yet, these students may have support for their racial hoaxes by diversity-crazed administrators, who nationwide spend billions of dollars on diversity and a multiculturalist agenda. Racial discord and other kinds of strife are their meal tickets.

Black people, as well as homosexuals, should condemn these hoaxes, but so far, most have remained silent. If police are right that Smollett’s claims were a dastardly hoax, it will cause doubt to be cast on future real claims of assault based on race and sexual orientation. It also will have a negative impact on race relations. This is not something to be taken lightly. If Smollett is found guilty of a felony as he is charged, he should suffer heavy penalties, including jail time. There’s a lesson to be learned from one of Aesop’s fables, “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.”

Regarding “Schiff threatens lawsuit to disclose Mueller report” (Nation/World, Monday): Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is correct in saying the full report of the Mueller investigation be made available to the public for us to decide whether there was any coordination between Trump or any of his associates with Russia in swaying the 2016 presidential election. It is the only way to assure that the true facts are not changed or distorted in anyway. And to have new Attorney General William Barr state that he alone will decide in his own words what the public sees is ludicrous.

I, like many Americans, are quite capable of discerning the facts in the Mueller probe, and I don’t need “Good Morning America,” “60 Minutes” or Sean Hannity to do that for me.

This is a government of, by, and for the people and we have every right to see the full unedited report of the Mueller investigation.

Activists or terrorists?

Regarding “Opposition steps up call for action in action Venezuela crisis” (Nation/World, Monday): Although the designation “activists” is used in the article, the opposition in Venezuela should more accurately be described as terrorists. And it would follow that Venezuelan legislator Juan Guaido is the leader of this terrorist movement. He has no doubt made a deal with Trump for U.S. oil companies to exploit the country’s resources if he should be illegally installed as president. He is a puppet with U.S. pulling the strings. There is also no doubt he will be vastly enriched if the coup is successful.

It is past time for our country to stop fomenting regime changes in other lands. The policy has failed in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria and will fail in Venezuela.

Sadly, if a military option is made real, the failure will result in more American lives lost along with those, including civilians, of Venezuela.

Teacher’s lament

Regarding ""'Empire’ producers cut Smollett from season’s last episodes"" (Newsmakers, Saturday): Learning that Jussie Smollett made more than $100,000 per episode on the ‘Empire’ series and that he allegedly staged a hate crime as a media hoax to promote his career was sickening to me on many levels.

But it mostly was sickening because I know that most of our state’s teachers make less than half this amount per year working long hours each day for 10 months of the year and spend part of that on classroom materials that are not covered by school districts.

It is incredible to me that this actor would abuse his status privilege to hijack news coverage for this lowly attempt to gain notoriety and greed when hard-working women and men are serving the public to educate our children for a fraction of his income. Maybe one day our value system will be retooled, and educators will be valued as much as star crazed celebrities.

The U.S. isn’t a banana republic, but its police apparatus sometimes comes close.

The broadening revelations of the lawless, almost putschist excesses of the Comey-McCabe FBI and elements of the Justice Department and the Brennan-Clapper intelligence services invite serious contemplation of how close the United States came to being a country where regime change might be plausibly and self-righteously attempted by what in undemocratic countries is generally known as the secret police. It is fantastic to contemplate such a thing in the United States, which is fundamentally prouder of nothing than of its Constitution and the immense place that the system created by that Constitution and maintained these 230 years by recourse to interpretation and reassertion of it has played in the unprecedented rise of America from a loosely connected group of colonists numbering only a few million at independence to the overwhelming preeminence of the U.S.A. at the end of the Second World War. That preeminence has been substantially maintained since.

For at least 60 years I have heard high American officials announce that the United Sates is not a “banana republic.” Of course it is not, and never was. But there is a complacency about America’s status as a society of laws that is both unbecoming and unjustified. As many judges, lawyers, and commentators have noted, the level of prosecution success in criminal cases is over 95 percent, 97 percent of those without a trial; these, and the proportion of the population that is incarcerated, are totalitarian numbers. Congressional investigations where there is no lawyer–client privilege, the ease of alleging and gaining convictions on charges of dishonest responses to the police, as well as media trials long before a defense has even been filed (as in the Jussie Smollett case, where the chief of police of Chicago has been garrulously babbling out the prosecution evidence); all of this is a Star Chamber. None of it would be admissible in any other serious common-law country, such as Great Britain, Canada, Australia, or Ireland.

Every nomination to the Supreme Court is now a pitched battle replete with paid demonstrators at hearings and extensive campaigns of character assassination, but that court has sat inert as practically all the Bill of Rights’ constitutional assurances of due process, prompt and impartial justice, and the avoidance of capricious prosecutions have been abandoned. It is in this, as other civilized jurisdictions would consider it, tenuous state of the rule of law that the antics of the Comey-McCabe FBI and Brennan-Clapper intelligence direction, and their partisan effort to bend the law to install Hillary Clinton as president and sandbag Donald Trump, should be considered.

Celebrated as Thomas Jefferson rightly is for his seminal role in the creation of the country’s initial texts and its early governance, one achievement for which he has received insufficient credit is the founding of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1802. While this began as a corps of engineers limited to 20 men at first (led by Benjamin Franklin’s nephew, Jonathan Williams), the objective was to assure a non-political class of officers. The focus on engineering was, at this early stage, the young nation’s chief military requirement.

Jefferson’s initiative assured the United States of a nonpolitical military. The country has had twelve presidents who were celebrated combat military officers, from Washington to Eisenhower, including citizen generals such as Jackson, Hayes, and Garfield. And it has had a number of presidents who were distinguished middle or junior officers, including Presidents Truman, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and George H. W. Bush, and six high-ranking military officers who were unsuccessful presidential candidates, including the first Republican candidate, Colonel John C. Frémont; a general fired by Abraham Lincoln as commander of the Army of the Potomac, George B. McClellan, who had the effrontery to run against Lincoln in 1864; and a hero POW, John McCain.

The point of this recitation is that none of these people dabbled in politics while they were in the armed forces. The only serious figure who did so was General Douglas MacArthur, who, in response to a freshet of Republican-delegate enthusiasm from a midwestern state while he was preparing to liberate the Philippines, wrote to a supporter for public circulation a letter stating that he would accept the Republican nomination in 1944, but would be unable to campaign (as if his commander-in-chief, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, would tolerate such a thing from a serving theater commander). When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in 1952, and was asked when he became Republican, he replied: “Today.” No soldier has led Great Britain since Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century, except the Duke of Wellington, for two years.

The federal police (FBI) are another matter. The leader of a successful previous organization and of the FBI for a total of 47 years, J. Edgar Hoover, has been strenuously criticized for his unscrupulous political machinations, but he never attempted to influence a presidential election. When the military are depoliticized, the secret police and intelligence services, if not reined in, can be very powerful, in a democratic country as in a dictatorship. In the Soviet Union, the army only briefly was politically influential, under Marshal Zhukhov just after the death of Stalin, while Stalin’s last three secret-police leaders, Yagoda, Yezhov, and Beria, were all summarily executed after they had done a great deal of his unimaginable dirty work. Even in revolutionary and Napoleonic France, the greatest police minister in all history, the egregiously cunning Joseph Fouché, who sent the head of the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre, to the guillotine at the end of the Reign of Terror, after Robespierre had tried to do the same to him, was sent packing finally, rich but mistrusted and powerless.

American democracy is insuperably strong in the hearts of the people and in 230 years of triumphant survival through a vehement and contentious national history. But the recent fantastic cascade of professions of righteous untouchability from Comey and McCabe and Brennan and Clapper shows that there is no institutional tradition of respect for and deference to the constitutional integrity of the system in the main police and intelligence agencies. Though fired for dishonesty and sent for grand-jury evaluation as a criminal lying to Congress and out of control, Andrew McCabe generally enjoys the support of the Trump-hating media in his book tour, celebrating a lawless disregard for the supremacy of the people under the Constitution. He feared that Trump might be a “Russian asset,” and accordingly set a special counsel with practically unlimited powers, who engaged a fervently partisan Democratic staff, upon him.

Almost the entire legal system of the United States requires radical reform and democratization, and the disarming of a virtually omnipotent prosecutocracy. It is the strength and the weakness of America that it is not really the gentle and kindly country portrayed by Norman Rockwell and Walt Disney. That America exists and is a revered pastoral self-image. But the United States is ultimately a jungle, and jungles are ruled by 30-foot constricting snakes and 600-pound cats, and these are usually the rulers of America, with a varying level of humanization.

The intense struggle for the highest positions in the country is a generally meritocratic struggle, with only rare lapses into mediocrity. The survival and elevation process leaves an inordinate number of severely shattered people. In such a society, the senior police and intelligence apparatus can be dangerous, and in the last few years, it has been. The outcome of the present struggle for power in Washington should include tighter civilian control of these agencies, as in the military, the end of the effort to criminalize policy differences, and the end of the attempted reduction of the drastic remedy of impeachment to a partisan power play to reverse the result of elections. That is essentially what it was in the Nixon and Clinton presidencies and has been since the 2016 election.

Attorney Daniel Barnett said the evidence is circumstantial and doesn’t provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Nikki Joly set the August 2017 fire that killed five pets at his home in Jackson.

The 54-year-old Joly was charged last year with first-degree arson. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court, The Detroit News reported.

“We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,” Elmer Hitt, Jackson’s director of police and fire services, said Monday. “We investigated it over what probably was a year’s time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.”

MLive.com obtained the arson investigation report that says gas station surveillance video shows Joly buying gasoline the day of the fire and traces of gasoline was found on his clothes. Phone records and witness statements show Joly was home around the time the fire was set, the report said.

“The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being seen,” police detective Aaron Grove wrote in the report.

Hitt declined to provide a potential motive for the arson. Barnett said the lack of motive causes doubt in the prosecutor’s case.

“It doesn’t make sense,” Barnett said. “(Joly) was citizen of the year.”

A local newspaper selected Joly as Jackson’s citizen of the year in 2018. Joly helped open the city’s first gay community centre, organized its first gay pride festival and helped pass a nondiscrimination ordinance.

Chicago police last week charged the black and gay “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting a racist and homophobic attack.

The man police say is Greenberg then pushed Williams repeatedly and punched him in the face. Greenberg could not be reached for comment.

AD

The news comes after a days long campaign by conservative activists both at Berkeley and nationally, who have argued, on social media, right-leaning political websites and Fox News, that because of liberal bias, the attack garnered what they perceive as a delayed response from the police and university and a muted response from the public.

AD

“Wonder if it would be the same if a conservative beat up a leftist on the Berkeley Campus?” President Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted Tuesday afternoon before news of the arrest. He shared the headline of a Fox News story: “Conservatives call out Berkeley police for lack of arrest one week after campus assault on activist.”

The group Williams was working with on campus, Turning Point USA, was founded in 2012 as a conservative grass-roots network for Americans on college campuses and in high schools. The UC Berkeley chapter had asked for recruiting assistance from Williams, who is not a student there but works as a field representative for another conservative group, the Leadership Institute.

AD

Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, rallied conservatives around the incident. “A conservative is the victim of a vicious attack, and no one is held responsible? Where is the media?” Kirk, who has amassed a large social media following, tweeted Monday: “Hate crime!”

AD

But university spokesman Dan Mogulof said that characterizations that the university and the police department acted with a liberal bias were unfounded.

“We have a police force that is dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is enforcing the law and bringing people to justice,” Mogulof said. “They operate independently, and they are professionals.”

Mogulof said public perception of the investigation should not be swayed by “armchair” law enforcement officials.

AD

Williams did not respond to an interview request from The Washington Post, but he did appear on several Fox News and Fox Business TV segments. In one interview, Williams told Fox Business’s Stuart Varney that the men who approached him took issue with a sign displayed by Turning Point USA that claimed hate crime hoaxes harm real victims, a reference to the Jussie Smollett case. The two men began cursing, Williams said, before one became physically aggressive.

AD

“At that moment, I knew this might be a troublesome situation,” Williams told Fox Business, “so I took out my phone and started recording right then.” Nearby, another student began recording, too, capturing on video the escalating violence.

The videos show a man wearing a backpack and black clothes shove Williams repeatedly and then punch him in the face.

AD

Within days, university leaders had condemned the attack, and authorities said they had identified a possible suspect.

But the response time, campus activists argued, was insufficient.

In a Twitter thread two days after the assault, Bradley Devlin, a UC Berkeley student and former president of the campus College Republicans, praised the police for sending an alert and the administration for condemning the violence in media reports. But he critiqued the chancellor for not sending a campuswide letter with the same sentiment.

AD

Soon after, a message was sent to the Berkeley community.

“Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason,” Chancellor Carol Christ and Vice Chancellor for student affairs Stephen C. Sutton wrote. “That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here. Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.”

AD

Devlin believes the statement was a direct response to pressure from conservative activists.

“After several years of violent, liberal intolerance, conservative students and activists wanted the university to commit in practice to the ideals they express in theory,” he said.

The following day, the university police department announced that it had identified a suspect and determined that he was not a student or member of the UC Berkeley staff or faculty.

AD

In the Fox Business interview, Williams’s black eye from the attack was still visible.

“There is a certain culture that is especially hostile on Berkeley’s campus, and across the country, to conservative students,” Williams said. “They’re willing to use violence if they think you’re being too controversial.”

AD

Since President Trump took office, the Berkeley campus has become a national stage for bitter tensions between the far left and the far right. The cancellation of conservative commentator Ann Coulter’s speech on campus in 2017 garnered widespread coverage.

Campus authorities feared riots would break out and safety would be compromised. Coulter said that “everyone who should be for free speech” had “turned tail and run.”

This incomplete thread chronicled dozens of such hoaxes during the Trump era, and now there appears to be a doozy to add to the list. The following story out of Michigan is wild. Local officials have accused a local LGBT activist of setting fire to his own house:

When the home of Nikki Joly burned down in 2017, killing five pets, the FBI investigated it as a hate crime. After all, the transgender man and gay rights activist had received threats after having a banner year in this conservative town. In the prior six months, he helped open the city’s first gay community center, organized the first gay festival and, after 18 years of failed attempts, helped lead a bruising battle for an ordinance that prohibits discrimination against gays. For his efforts, a local paper named him the Citizen of the Year. Authorities later determined the fire was intentionally set, but the person they arrested came as a shock to both supporters and opponents of the gay rights movement. It was the citizen of the year — Nikki Joly. “It’s embarrassing,” said Travis Trombley, a gay resident who fought for the ordinance. “How do you do it to the community you have put so much effort into helping?”

Why would Jolly do such a thing? Arson is an extremely serious felony, and killing multiple pets in the process is simply horrific. The suspected motive is pathetic:

A police investigative report suggests a possible reason for the fire. Two people who worked with Joly at St. Johns United Church of Christ, where the Jackson Pride Center was located, said he had been frustrated the controversy over gay rights had died down with the passage of the nondiscrimination law, according to the report. The church officials, Barbara Shelton and Bobby James, when asked by police about a possible motive for the fire, said Joly was disappointed the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival, held five days before the blaze, hadn’t received more attention or protests.

""Or protests."" If confirmed, this would suggest that Joly is more or less addicted to activism. Having won a number of battles in his community, he grew bored by the lack of controversy, so he allegedly manufactured one. The point of activism ought to be making policy progress, preferably while winning over hearts and minds. Achieving such progress, and being met with public ambivalence, should be considered a double victory. Accomplishments, coupled with public indifference. This is how equality is normalized. But if personal gratification and adrenaline rushes became the priority, as it increasingly appears, that's not activism. That's selfishness. Criminal selfishness. And incinerating two dogs and three cats in pursuit of this 'activism high' is unspeakably cruel. Imagine being so obsessed with the act of confronting bigotry that you literally torch your home and kill your pets in the process of inventing bigotry to confront.

The Detroit News story also notes a number of previous actions and manipulations that alienated Joly's own allies, suggesting that this crusader exhibited warning signs about his trustworthiness. After the blaze destroyed the home he was renting, Joly urged supporters to be ""very angry,"" and channel that rage into pushing for change. Local groups raised nearly $60,000 to help him. But following an investigation, police gathered evidence that pointed in one direction:

The sequence of events would have made it difficult for anyone but Joly to set the fire, Grove said in the police report. “The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being scene,” wrote Grove. Joly told an insurance company investigator the arsonist must have been in the home at the same time he was, according to the report. Lab tests by police found traces of gasoline on the clothes Joly was wearing on the day of the fire, said the report. Two weeks after the fire, Joly was questioned for four hours by a city police detective and two FBI agents. During the interview, he drooped his head, staring at the floor, not looking at his interlocutors, according to the report. He didn’t admit setting the fire and didn’t deny it, either.

After 13 months of police work, Joly was finally arrested. He's been charged with arson, appearing in court earlier this month. The case, which has roiled the local community since 2017, has received renewed scrutiny in the context of the Smollett story. The purpose of highlighting this story is absolutely not to claim that genuine hate crimes do not exist. According to a number of metrics (which are sometimes imperfect, and some organizations tracking such things have no credibility), reported US hate crimes have increased in recent years, especially against Jews. The purpose of calling out hoaxes is to (a) shame the perpetrators, who are hurting their own supposed causes through myopic and sociopathic tactics, and (b) to try to tap the breaks on society's knee-jerk overreactions to certain allegations. Phony hate crimes make it harder for real victims to be believed, while sowing dissent and distrust. They are insidious and damaging -- and must be met with strong social opprobrium and severe punishment.

JACKSON, Mich. (AP) — Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist tried to fabricate a hate crime by setting his home on fire, but the man’s attorney is questioning the evidence.

Attorney Daniel Barnett said the evidence is circumstantial and doesn’t provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Nikki Joly set the August 2017 fire that killed five pets at his home in Jackson.

The 54-year-old Joly was charged last year with first-degree arson. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court, The Detroit News reported.

“We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,” Elmer Hitt, Jackson’s director of police and fire services, said Monday. “We investigated it over what probably was a year’s time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.”

MLive.com obtained the arson investigation report that says gas station surveillance video shows Joly buying gasoline the day of the fire and traces of gasoline was found on his clothes. Phone records and witness statements show Joly was home around the time the fire was set, the report said.

“The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being seen,” police detective Aaron Grove wrote in the report.

Hitt declined to provide a potential motive for the arson. Barnett said the lack of motive causes doubt in the prosecutor’s case.

“It doesn’t make sense,” Barnett said. “(Joly) was citizen of the year.”

A local newspaper selected Joly as Jackson’s citizen of the year in 2018. Joly helped open the city’s first gay community center, organized its first gay pride festival and helped pass a nondiscrimination ordinance.

Chicago police last week charged the black and gay “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting a racist and homophobic attack."

The 32-year-old actress felt compelled to write on the subject after Smollett was arrested on a felony disorderly conduct charge for filing a false police report, which claimed the “Empire” star was attacked in an alleged hate crime.

“The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath. I had no reason to doubt Jussie… If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes.”

When Nikki Joly’s two-story home in Jackson, Mich. went up in flames in August 2017, it grabbed the attention of local newspapers and other concerned citizens in the community, some of whom initially worried the fire could have been intentionally set and may have been a hate crime against the outspoken gay rights campaigner.

More than a year later, however, the 54-year-old Joly faces a charge of one felony count of first-degree arson for the Aug. 10, 2017 fire that destroyed his home and killed his two German shepherds and three cats.

At the time, coverage of the case was almost entirely limited to local media.

Then, the Jussie Smollett story broke.

MICHIGAN MOM WHO KILLED HER 3 CHILDREN USED FAKE DOCTOR'S NOTE TO GET THEM OUT OF SCHOOL, INVESTIGATORS SAY

The 36-year-old Smollett is accused of orchestrating an elaborate hoax via two “bogus” hate crimes – one employing an alleged attack, and one involving a threatening letter and mysterious (but ultimately harmless) white powder – all in order to secure a pay raise. He was charged in Chicago with felony disorderly conduct last week and remains free on bail.

But Joly’s attorney is pushing back on the comparisons to Smollett, saying the case against the transgender man was never touted or investigated as a hate crime.

Elmer Hitt, director of police and fire services in Jackson, told Fox News on Tuesday that some in the community – as well as the police investigators – considered the possibility the fire may have been a hate crime, it's just that, ultimately, the investigation led them to look at the blaze as arson.

“It was investigated as arson with the potential, initially, of it being a hate crime,” Hitt said.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S ALLEGED HATE CRIME HOAX SHEDS LIGHT ON SIMILAR PHONY ACCUSATIONS

Joly’s attorney, Andrew Abood, told Fox News that throughout the investigation and recent court proceedings, Joly never claimed the fire was a hate crime.

“There is no comparison. In [the Smollett] case, two people were paid by the actor. Our client never said it was a hate crime,” Abood said when reached over the phone on Tuesday. “We have maintained all along and he asserted through four hours of interrogation with the FBI that he did not start the fire.""

But authorities disagreed. Joly was arrested and charged in October, shocking his supporters.

“It’s embarrassing,” Travis Trombley, a gay resident who fought for an anti-discrimination ordinance that Joly championed for years in Jackson, the Detroit News. “How do you do it to the community you have put so much effort into helping?”

Joly had been touted for his relentless 18-year effort to pass the local anti-discrimination law designed to protect members of the LGBT community and minorities in Jackson.

“There is no space for hate and ultimately, love will win,"" Joly told MLive in an extensive profile last year after he was named Jackson’s Citizen of the Year. ""I believe that, 99 percent of the time.""

Yet, only months after that profile, officials say Joly traded love for a lighter, starting the fire at the home he shared with his longtime partner, Chris Moore.

No one was home at the time and traces of gasoline were later found in five rooms on the first floor.

A neighbor, identified in a police report as Robert Tulloch, was among the first people interviewed after the fire.

CALIFORNIA PROFESSOR REPRIMANDED FOR SAYING POLICE 'NEED TO BE KILLED,' REPORTS SAY

According to the Detroit News, Tulloch was questioned about his whereabouts because he had sent a threatening letter to the city manager and council objecting to plans to raise a rainbow flag at a city park as part of pride events planned for later that month.

“That is an in-your-face declaration and will be met with a violent response,” the email read in part, police said.

However, Tulloch’s whereabouts at the time of the fire – he was making a deposit at a bank drive-thru – were confirmed and he was cleared.

As they investigated further, Jackson police began to zero-in on a new suspect: Joly.

According to the Detroit News, Joly told police he bought $10 worth of gasoline the morning of the fire to mow the lawn. When it got too hot to continue, he stopped and went to work at St. Johns United Church of Christ, where the Jackson Pride Center was located.

While at work, Joly received a phone call from Moore, who said she had forgotten her lunch at home and wondered if Joly could bring it over to her.

That call was at 1:02 p.m., police said.

Joly told police he returned to the home and went inside for a minute or two before leaving again. The fire was first reported by neighbors at 1:16 p.m.

Police Det. Aaron Grove wrote in his report the sequence of events made it difficult for anyone but Joly to set the fire.

“The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being [seen],” he wrote.

Two weeks after the fire, Joly was interviewed by city police and two FBI agents. He didn’t admit to setting the blaze, but didn’t deny it either, the Detroit News reported.

Hitt declined to offer a motive for the house fire, saying it would be made public by the prosecution at trial.

A police investigation report, however, suggests a possible reason for the arson could have been Joly’s apparent frustration with the recent lack of controversy and protests surrounding gay rights in Jackson after the passage of the non-discrimination law, the Detroit News reported.

MICHAEL GOODWIN: WHAT TRUMP HATE CRIME 'VICTIMS' HOPE TO GET OUT OF THEIR LIES

Abood told Fox News on Tuesday that police are basing their case against Joly only on coincidence, on a “hunch.”

“It is simply a matter of coincidence and that is tantamount to a hunch and certainly not beyond a reasonable doubt,” he said.

Regardless of the outcome in the Smollett and Joly cases, experts said when presumed victims of hate crimes are actually the perpetrators, it is “terrible” for social movements, specifically for people “facing real hate crimes.”

“Real hate crimes are on the rise,” Graham Cassano, associate professor of sociology at Oakland University, told the Detroit Free Press on Monday. “But as these crimes increase and become publicized, it’s not surprising to me that people would take the opportunity to use this to their advantage and fabricate hate crimes.”

Cassano added: ""When someone comes along and fabricates a hate crime it calls into question people who have really experienced these things. It's absolutely awful. It really, to my mind, is incomprehensible.""

Now that Chicago police say they have debunked the “Empire” actor’s key claims, and he is facing a felony charge of filing a false police report, the scandal remains an indictment of an increasingly polarized cultural moment. Smollett has steadfastly maintained his innocence.

The fast-developing story has fed directly into the divisions between right and left, white and black, urban and rural, gay and straight, and binary and nonbinary gender identifications that have spurred a level of paranoia frequently compared with that of the McCarthy era. The deleterious effects of the 24/7 stream of agitprop and outrage that fuels social media only add to the toxic stew.

“This is a tragedy no matter what,” says Van Jones, CNN host and political commentator, who is founder of the Oakland-based nonprofit Dream Corps. “Either he’s telling the truth and not being believed or more likely he’s let down millions of fans and certainly hurt the cause of social justice for the true victims of hate crimes. Either way, we’re seeing a tragedy unfold.”

The Smollett case has grabbed the public’s attention not just because he’s a celebrity but because the dizzying arc of his fall from grace — after generating so much sympathy as a victim — so perfectly reflects the debates raging in a hyperactive and information-saturated news environment. Smollett was instantly catapulted into the global spotlight, some might say by his own design.

Katheryn Russell-Brown, a law professor at the University of Florida, has studied more than 100 racial hoaxes, involving both white people inventing black assailants and black people inventing white attackers. In the latter case, she says the assault is typically portrayed as a hate crime.

“This case fits right in,” she says. “It’s drawn as this fight for social justice and recognition.” With all the combustible elements — race, violence, fraud, celebrity and Trump — it was a media storm in the making. “It’s a story that everyone can talk about.”

Smollett was arrested Feb. 21 and released on $100,000 bail. He continues to assert that he is telling the truth about the devastating ambush.

A week after he earned an NAACP Image Award nomination for his work on “Empire,” Smollett was dropped from the final two episodes of the Chicago-based production’s 18-episode order for Season 5. His status on a presumed Season 6 is highly questionable. In the estimation of many, Smollett’s career in entertainment is effectively over, irreparably damaged as reaction to his stunning downfall runs the gamut from snickering to scorn.

“This is a moment where everybody needs to take a step back and look in the mirror,” Jones says. “You don’t get something this big and this messy unless there are a lot of things going wrong in the culture.”

Smollett’s story has garnered worldwide attention because it touched so many raw nerves. The actor told police that he was jumped by two men wearing ski masks who yelled homophobic and racial slurs and told him that Chicago was “MAGA country.”

“You don’t get something this big and this messy unless there are a lot of things going wrong in the culture.”

Van Jones

The reference to President Donald Trump’s signature slogan instantly turned the incident into a political act in addition to a hate crime. Smollett also said the men, who have since cooperated with police, poured a substance thought to be bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck in a noose-like fashion. The claims painted a picture of a real-world “Purge” mentality surfacing to endanger the lives of those in historically marginalized communities.

False claims about Trump supporters only widen the trust gap, making it harder for everyone to unclench fists and find common ground. But Trump also bears some blame for the current environment, asserts Jones.

“Unfortunately, we have seen people use dishonesty, manipulation and divisive rhetoric and make it to the White House,” he says. “The idea of alternative facts, and people only caring about their own tribes and selective outrage — this is not just a Jussie issue. This has leached out from the White House into our whole political culture.”

At the same time, Smollett’s case offers a lesson for the body politic about the danger of making instant judgments on social media — as many celebrities and politicians did — about abuse and misconduct claims. “We have to ask ourselves, are we overreacting to centuries of oppressed people not being believed to the point where we are creating an incentive for people to say things that aren’t true to get our support?” Jones suggests.

In an extraordinary public rebuke, Chicago Police Dept. Superintendent Eddie Johnson detailed the investigation that led authorities to determine that Smollett staged the incident with two acquaintances, who were paid $3,500. Johnson, who is African-American, didn’t hide his disdain for having to devote time and money to investigate what police believe to be a bogus claim spurred in part by Smollett’s “dissatisfaction” with his “Empire” salary. Most contemptible, in the view of Johnson and others, was Smollett’s willingness to “take advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Using a noose to invoke the harrowing history of African-Americans facing lynch mobs was a flash point for many observers.

“I’m left hanging my head and asking why,” Johnson said Feb. 21 during a news conference following Smollett’s arrest. “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

Smollett, here with A.Z. Kelsey on Fox’s “Empire,” has been dropped from the season’s final two episodes.

CNN’s Jones also calls the use of a noose “the heart of the offense” for those concerned with social justice. He points to the irony that the history of lynching was put in sharp relief last year when civil rights activist Bryan Stevenson at long last opened the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Ala. Smollett himself appeared in an episode of the Epix documentary series “America Divided” devoted to hate crimes that included a visit to the Peace and Justice memorial.

Marc Feldman, a psychiatrist who specializes in factitious disorders, says that patients who make false reports typically do so out of a need for nurturing.

“They want to be cared for. They want to be honored and respected and loved,” Feldman says. “This behavior helps achieve that goal. They may have a lot of apparent success in life, but it’s not enough.” Feldman adds that some people may concoct false scenarios as a way of reasserting control over their situations. Some may also get a thrill from misleading people.

“This may have been the ultimate game and sport for Mr. Smollett,” Feldman says. “I think it was ultimately a selfish gesture.”

“Selfish” is the last word that Smollett’s friends and co-workers would use to describe the actor, who became a fan favorite for his role as the openly gay son Jamal who clashes with his music mogul father on “Empire.” Smollett has been highly regarded by Fox executives as a team player and tireless supporter of the show. The esteem with which he was held has made the turn of events since Jan. 29 that much harder for those around him to process.

Jones, who has done extensive work in the field of criminal justice reform and rehabilitation, maintains that there is still hope for Smollett, if guilty, to turn his reputation around.

“In the fullness of time, forgiveness, redemption and reconciliation are possible in all things,” he says. “He’s still a very young guy and a very talented guy. I don’t think God is finished with Jussie Smollett yet.”

Kelly was bailed out of jail by his “friend,” Valencia Love on Monday. The 47-year-old, who is a corporate officer for a child care center and a manager of a restaurant, both in Chicago, has come under fire after paying the $100,000 bond. There have been calls for a boycott of the restaurant — Love on the Blu — and many were questioning how a woman who works with children could bring herself to bail out an accused pedophile.

Love on the Blu was promptly ripped with negative reviews on Yelp, a social networking site that lets users post reviews and rate businesses. “It sucks,” one commentator wrote about the restaurant. “But what sucks EVEN more is that the owner a WOMAN is SUPPORTING a CHILD MOLESTER. Let this place it’s bad food and morally poor owner go out of business.”

Another said, “It really will be our own. The fact that this BLACK WOMAN could bail out a rapist and an abuser is despicable. You own a children’s day care. You should be ashamed of yourself. He’s spent millions of dollars settling cases out of court. And you still think he’s innocent?! Every day you walk into your daycare I hope you realize you have failed those children”

The Yelp page says at the top, “This business is being monitored by Yelp’s Support team for content related to media reports.”

There were also calls for a boycott: This is the woman who bailed @rkelly out of jail. She owns @LoveOnTheBlu in Blue Island and Lord and Child Daycare in Chicago. Her name is Valencia Love. SHUT HER DOWN. pic.twitter.com/4ZobPfYpDk — kiki bryant (@uppitykiki) February 26, 2019 In an interview on Tuesday with Chicago reporter Tia Ewing, Love defended herself by claiming she didn’t condone abuse and insisted the Grammy Award-winning singer needed a chance to “prove his innocence.”

“He’s not a monster, he’s not,” she said before adding, “He’s been nothing but a gentleman to me.” She also inferred that Kelly was innocent, saying in part that “There are three sides to every story, his side, there’s [sic] (the alleged victims, and the truth.

Read Love’s comments below.

There may still be more trouble for Kelly. After his release from jail on Monday, Kelly, 52, drove straight to the flagship McDonald’s in Chicago’s River North, also known as the Rock ‘n’ Roll McDonald’s. It was the same location where he allegedly met a teenager who he got pregnant before arranging for an abortion, according to Jim DeRogatis, the Chicago journalist who has been reporting on Kelly’s sex allegations for decades.

Among the conditions of his release from jail, the judge ordered Kelly not to have contact with females under 18. McDonald’s is, of course, in many places a haven for teenagers.

Patrice Jones, one of Kelly’s many accusers, sued the singer in 2002, years after he allegedly picked her up as a teenager at the same Chicago Rock ‘n’ Roll McDonald’s in 1998. She claimed Kelly got her pregnant when she was underage and that he arranged for her to get an abortion, according to Jim DeRogatis, the Chicago journalist who has been reporting on Kelly’s sex allegations for decades.

Prison time might be sooner than later for Kelly.

Just days after Smollett was hospitalized, Page appeared on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, where she condemned the attack, expressed frustration with the way the media was covering it and suggested that such hate crimes were tied to the anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs and rhetoric of members of the Trump administration.

In her THR piece, Page did not directly address the recent developments in the Smollett case, including the actor’s arrest for filing a false police report (the Chicago Police believe Smollett staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on Empire). Instead, she focused on the very real violence that LGBTQ+ people face, starting with the story of two openly gay women who were physically and verbally harassed at a Seattle Seahawks game this past December.

“We, as LGBTQ+ people, are forced to fear for our safety because instances of hate violence, like the violence these women experienced in Seattle, happen,” Page said. “They happen to us all the time. It’s the fear that makes us pause before grabbing the hand of our loved one in public. It’s the fear that makes us consider whether or not we are in physical danger before we lean in for a kiss on the cheek.”

Page spoke about meeting survivors of hate crimes while making her docuseries, Gaycation, and noted that recent FBI crime data shows that hate crime in America have risen for three straight years. She also spoke about the psychological toll that hate speech has on members of the LGBTQ+ community, leading them to self-harm or to not report violence for fear of not being believed.

“I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists,” Page said. “The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told.”"

Ola and Abel Osundairo have apparently deleted homophobic tweets that went viral Tuesday.

The Blast reported two tweets were deleted over the past 24 hours. Ola Osundairo tweeted in 2013, “Why you following Frank Ocean … you know that ni**a gay right.” Another message read, “YOU’RE GAY THATS WHO YOU ARE.” Ola also once wrote, “I don’t follow any man. I follow woman.”

If they had no issue with the tweets they wouldn’t have deleted them, but the social media posts may haunt them. After the Chicago Police Department claimed the brothers told them the attack was orchestra by Jussie and they were paid $3,500, they released the following statement: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

But there were more credibility issues with their story.

Earlier this week, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” when they said Jussie sent a hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself. One federal law enforcement source told TMZ, “I think he [Johnson] went too far. We’re not there yet.”

TMZ also reported, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson may have also gone too far when he said Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.'” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

TMZ also reported, “There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the ‘attack’ — Bon [Abel Osundairo] wrote, ‘I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.’ Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ‘This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.'” The $3,500 breakdown was reportedly “$600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks,” according to TMZ reports.

The brothers were also on video appearing to buy items allegedly used for the attack.

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett has denied all allegations he staged the attack.

(AP) — In a story Feb. 26 about a Michigan transgender, gay rights activist charged with arson, The Associated Press reported erroneously that police said the man tried to fabricate a hate crime by setting his home on fire. The FBI initially investigated the arson as a possible hate crime but police have not provided a motive.

Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist set his own home on fire

JACKSON, Mich. (AP) — Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist charged with arson set his home on fire in an incident initially investigated by the FBI as a possible hate crime, but the man’s attorney is questioning the evidence.

Attorney Daniel Barnett said the evidence is circumstantial and doesn’t provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Nikki Joly set the August 2017 fire that killed five pets at his home in Jackson.

The 54-year-old Joly was charged last year with first-degree arson. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court, The Detroit News reported.

“We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,” Elmer Hitt, Jackson’s director of police and fire services, said Monday. “We investigated it over what probably was a year’s time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.”

MLive.com obtained the arson investigation report that says gas station surveillance video shows Joly buying gasoline the day of the fire and traces of gasoline were found on his clothes. Phone records and witness statements show Joly was home around the time the fire was set, the report said.

“The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being seen,” police detective Aaron Grove wrote in the report.

Hitt declined to provide a potential motive for the arson. Barnett said the lack of motive causes doubt in the prosecutor’s case.

“It doesn’t make sense,” Barnett said. ”(Joly) was citizen of the year.”

A local newspaper selected Joly as Jackson’s citizen of the year in 2018. Joly helped open the city’s first gay community center, organized its first gay pride festival and helped pass a nondiscrimination ordinance.

Chicago police last week charged the black and gay “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting a racist and homophobic attack."

James Crowley in the summer of 2009, the immediate reaction among many was that Sgt. Crowley was a racist and a bigot, arresting Gates merely on the basis that he was black. (The police, investigating a suspected burglary, were involved in an altercation with Gates over his identification and finally arrested him on charges of disorderly conduct.)

People without the slightest idea of what police officers deal with every day to protect themselves and the populace were consulted as experts, fully equipped to comment on the “racial” event. Crowley’s name was all over the media, the catalyst for furious speculation about racial profiling in America.

Yet in the midst of all the confusion, many blacks spoke in Crowley’s defense, including Colin Powell and a black police officer by the name of Leon Lashley, who was present at the time of Gates’s arrest.

Lashley declared that he supported Crowley “100 percent.”[1] Powell acknowledged that the situation would have been better had “Skip” (referring to Gates) come outside and talked to the officer.

But the facts were largely ignored by those eager to take offense at the mere idea of racial profiling. Cambridge Mayor E. Dennis Simmons declared that “race plays a role in everything.”[2]

Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick was of a similar opinion, and declared that as a friend of Gates, he was “troubled” by his arrest.[3] Ryan S. King, a policy analyst at the Sentencing Project, was so convinced that the event represented a clear example of racial profiling that she declared,

“If you look at every stage of the criminal justice system from initial police contact all the way through sentencing and incarceration, you see that African Americans are disproportionately impacted by each stage. What we ultimately see as disparate incarceration rates are contributed to by all of these factors.”[4]

Jelani Cobb of Spelman College agreed with her.[5] Charles Ogletree of Harvard, a close friend of Gates and a lawyer who represented Gates as his attorney after the incident, argued that it was after Gates produced “both his Harvard University identification and his Massachusetts driver’s license with his photo and address on it” that Gates was eventually arrested.[6]

According to Ogletree’s argument, Gates was presumed guilty before the evidence was examined. Yet this does not fit the facts.

First, Ogletree based his argument on the account of a single eye-witness: Gates himself. Even Ogletree admits that is a challenging position, saying “as Professor Gates’ attorney, I am aware that I present one person’s perspective on the matter,” but justifying that “my conclusions are also based on decades of experiences in courtrooms, classrooms, and public and private forums.”[7] Although impressive, Ogletree’s resume cannot by itself be used as a substitute for legal evidence.

As Gates’s lawyer, it was his duty to present facts proving that the police judged Gates on a racial basis or arrested him unlawfully. Yet Ogletree provided no hard evidence and even admitted that there was nothing in Sgt. Crowley’s record to show that he was a racist, for Crowley “is well respected by his African American former coach at CRLS, George Greenidge.”[8]

Second, Sgt. Crowley had other officers with him, including Lashley, who defended Crowley’s actions. All officers at the scene testified that Gates only produced his identification after he was arrested.

Third, Sgt. Crowley’s prior record showed no hint of racism. With the central argument for his case falling apart, Ogletree’s last resort was to cry racial profiling, desperately marshaling the inarticulate and demonstrably false thesis that blacks are arrested because they are black (hence the much-quoted phrase driving while black).

Yet Crowley was promoted to his position as an instructor at the police academy by a black police commissioner. He even gave mouth-to-mouth to black athlete Reggie Lewis after he suffered a heart attack in 1993, when Crowley was working as security at Brandeis University. Reflecting on that event, Crowley noted,

“I wasn’t working on Reggie Lewis the basketball star. I wasn’t working on a black man. I was working on another human being.”[9]

The arguments claiming a racial motivation for officers arresting blacks are simply arguments without arguments, since they have little factual foundation.[10]

Things have changed a little over the years. One could say that the Henry Louis Gates debacle was an unfortunate event, but now we have people staging hoax in order to advance an ideology or even their careers. We are talking about “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.

Smollett deliberately staged a hate crime assault on himself and then filed a police report! The New York Times itself reported:

“One of the two men interviewed by the police in connection with a reported attack on the ‘Empire’ star Jussie Smollett has appeared on the show… he two who were questioned are brothers.”[11]

The Chicago police superintendent declared that Smollett staged the hate crime “because he was dissatisfied by his salary.”

In his report, Smollett declared that he was assaulted “by two men yelling homophobic and racial slurs in downtown Chicago. He told ‘Good Morning America’ in an interview broadcast Thursday morning that he was ‘pissed off’ by the attack and those who doubted his story, which is being investigated as a possible hate crime.”[12]

He said that the attackers were almost certainly Trump supporters, for they told him that this was “MAGA [Make America Great Again] country.”[13] Those Trump supporters, continued Smollett, grabbed him, placed a rope around his neck, and poured bleach on him. Smollett declared:

“It felt like minutes but it probably was like 30 seconds. I can’t tell you honestly. I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming.”[14]

So how did Smollett get out of this gruesome conundrum? Well, he “fought the fuck back.”[15] In other words, Smollett was like Batman fighting criminals and bad guys in the streets of Gotham. With his fighting skills and perhaps with some sophisticated gadgets like smoke pellets, black gauntlets, grapple guns, and batarangs, Smollett was able to “fight the fuck back.” Smollett went on numerous TV shows telling the inexorable truth while sobbing.

“I think people need to hear the truth,” Smollett said. “Cause everybody has their own idea. Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community — young, black children — to know how strong that they are.”[16]

Well, it turns out that the whole thing was a complete fabrication. It was reported that Smollett “paid $3,500 to two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to stage the attack ‘and drag Chicago’s reputation through the mud in the process.’” Johnson declared: “We have the check he used to pay them.”

So much for the Smollett debacle. But this was just the beginning. It has been reported that a transgender man by the name of Nikki Joly set fire to his own house in order to perpetuate the hoax that hate crime is alive and well.

What we are seeing here is that Smollett just shows the race crowd is really in a bad shape. The interesting thing is that he was uncritically being interviewed by the establishment without any skepticism. So sad.

Jussie Smollett, ""Empire"" actor, claimed that on Jan. 29, two masked men identifying themselves as Donald Trump supporters and using racial and homophobic insults attacked him. Smollett said the assailants yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" bashed his face, crushed his ribs, splashed him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. Smollett's telling of the hate crime was gobbled up hook, line and sinker by the anti-Trump news media, but Chicago police say it was a hoax. This type of hoax is part and parcel of the left's broad agenda of victimology, fraudulence and gimmickry, plus gross media gullibility, incompetence and political attention seeking. What's so troublesome is the fact that despite considerable evidence that the incident was a hoax, no apologies have been issued to either the public or the targets of their malfeasance — President Trump and the Americans who voted for him.

Racial hoaxes have been a major part of the leftist agenda going back decades. In 1987, the Rev. Al Sharpton created the Tawana Brawley hoax, wherein four white men were falsely accused of rape. For perpetrating the hoax, Sharpton was rewarded by receiving national recognition, millions of dollars and a career as a television/radio talk show host, and he ran for president in 2004. He also received 82 invitations to advise Barack Obama's White House on matters of race.

Most of the nation's racial hoaxes take place on college campuses. Recall the 2006 Duke lacrosse rape case, in which three affluent white male Duke students were falsely accused of raping a black female stripper. Police exposed Bowling Green State University student Eleesha Long as a liar after she complained about being attacked by Trump supporters the day after his election. At Goucher College in Maryland, scrawlings depicted swastikas and also spelled out the N-word and the names of four black students — including the perpetrator. The Maryland police found out that the perp was a 21-year-old black lacrosse player seeking victimhood. Nonetheless, the incident led to protests, demands for designated safe spaces and demands that incoming freshmen and transfers be required to take a ""cultural competency"" course.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has compiled some of the most outrageous hate crime hoaxes since Trump was elected. The hate crime hoaxes include claims of attacks on Muslim men and women by Trump supporters. A bisexual woman falsely claimed that Trump supporters were sending her nasty notes. Most of the hate crime hoaxes have been committed by black students. Their charges include the posting of KKK signs, the sending of racist notes and the writing of racist graffiti on a black person's door with the words ""Go Home N——- Boy"" and ""Whites Only."" A black man was caught on camera spray-painting doors and vehicles with racial slurs, vulgar words and swastikas.

Even professors create hoaxes. Indiana State University professor Azhar Hussain sent bogus anti-Muslim emails to himself, according to police, ""trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself."" He was arrested for filing a false police report.

Here's the good news about the racial hoaxes on the nation's college campuses: Left-wing college students have a difficult time finding the actual racism they claim permeates college campuses. Thus, they have to invent it. Though it has not been proved yet, these students may have support for their racial hoaxes by diversity-crazed administrators, who nationwide spend billions of dollars on diversity and a multiculturalist agenda. Racial discord and other kinds of strife are their meal tickets.

Black people, as well as homosexuals, should condemn these hoaxes, but so far, most have remained silent. If police are right that Smollett's claims were a dastardly hoax, it will cause doubt to be cast on future real claims of assault based on race and sexual orientation. It also will have a negative impact on race relations. This is not something to be taken lightly. If Smollett is found guilty of a felony as he is charged, he should suffer heavy penalties, including jail time. There's a lesson to be learned from one of Aesop's fables, ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf.""

93,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/27/media-covington-students-bias,2019-02-27 00:00:00,Was the media biased against the Covington students?,['Michael Massing'],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10aabef16787623eab901ce5fe1de90ada3dce97/81_0_2399_1440/master/2399.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=fbdd65427b901496ae9827d4e5fccbc8,"['wrote', 'sandmann', 'biased', 'media', 'catholic', 'covington', 'post', 'school', 'incident', 'trump', 'native', 'students', 'video']","Two recent incidents have strengthened conservatives’ belief that liberal journalists are implacably opposed to Donald Trump and his supporters: the 18 January encounter between a group of Kentucky students and a Native American activist on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and the claims by Jussie Smollett that he had been attacked by hoodlums shouting racist and anti-gay slurs. In both cases, conservatives say, journalists – based on flimsy evidence – trafficked in stereotypes that Trump supporters are vulgar bigots.

Is there any merit to these claims? Of the two cases, Smollett’s seems less revealing. If it is true (as the Chicago police now say) that he orchestrated the attack on himself, it can only be considered the twisted product of a warped mind. The initial reports about the incident were so troubling that even President Trump condemned it as “horrible”. Journalists – relying on police sources and quickly correcting the story as it unfolded – performed more or less responsibly.

The Lincoln Memorial case is more telling. As journalists themselves have acknowledged, the initial stories about the encounter between the students of Covington Catholic high school and Native American activist Nathan Phillips were based on a short video posted online that gave a partial and skewed account. A much longer video posted the following day showed that before the encounter the students had been taunted by a group of Black Hebrew Israelites, who called them “faggots”, “incest babies” and “dirty ass crackers”. The video also called into question claims made by Phillips in a series of interviews that the students had suddenly swarmed around him and blocked his path to the monument. All of this seems to provide another cautionary tale about the rush to publish in the age of 24-hour news.

But what about the charge of bias? Aside from the haste, was the coverage influenced by the media’s disgust with Trump and disdain for his supporters?

To assess these questions, I examined the coverage of one news organization. The Washington Post was the first major outlet to run a story based on the initial video, thus playing a key part in moving the incident from the internet to the mainstream. In addition, it is the subject of a lawsuit filed on behalf of Nicholas Sandmann, the 16-year-old student at the heart of the story, and his family.

According to the suit, the paper engaged in a modern form of McCarthyism by competing with other news organizations “to claim leadership of a mainstream and social media mob of bullies which attacked, vilified, and threatened” Sandmann, “an innocent secondary school child”. The Post, it claimed, targeted him “because he was the white, Catholic student wearing a red ‘Make America Great Again’ souvenir cap” on his school’s trip to Washington for the March for Life. According to the suit, the Post falsely accused Sandmann of instigating the incident and of engaging in “acts of racism” by “swarming” Phillips and “blocking” his path.

The paper, it went on, “ignored basic journalist standards” because it wanted to advance its well-known “biased agenda” against the president by “impugning individuals” perceived to be his supporters. The suit said it was seeking damages in excess of $250m because that is the amount Jeff Bezos paid for the paper in 2013. The Post says it plans to launch a vigorous defense.

It’s strange to see a suit accusing the Post of being politically motivated presenting its own case in such starkly political terms. But the details command attention. The Post’s initial story, it notes, was headlined, “It was getting ugly’: Native American drummer speaks on the MAGA-hat wearing teens who surrounded him.” Relying heavily on an interview with Phillips, the article relayed his claim “that he felt threatened by the teens and that they suddenly swarmed around him”. It also noted his assertion that he heard some in the crowd chanting “Build that wall.” It stated as well that he had served in Vietnam.

The piece carried statements from the Indigenous Peoples Movement calling the incident “emblematic of our discourse in Trump’s America” and from a Native American attorney branding it “an aggressive display of physicality”. It noted that school officials did not respond to a request for comment and that a spokeswoman for the diocese of Covington said officials were investigating; it gave no indication that it had sought comment from any of the students.

After the longer video (made by the Black Hebrew Israelites) was posted, the Post ran stories on both that group’s history of militant confrontation and on their profane taunting of the Kentucky students. It also corrected its earlier statement about Phillips’s military service (he had served in the Marine Corps but not in Vietnam).

In addition to these tangled reports, the Post ran a number of stories and columns that hewed to a clear story line. A historian named William S Cossen, for instance, wrote about “the Catholic Church’s shameful history of Native American abuses”. While the diocese and high school were investigating the incident, he wrote, they should also investigate “the Catholic Church’s history of interactions with indigenous people in the United States”. He went on to relate sordid highlights of that history, which included forced assimilation and “spiritual colonialism”.

Apparently that was not enough, for a few days later the Post featured another piece on how “the face-off between Catholic school teens and a Native American elder is a reminder of 500 years of conflict”. It quoted one scholar as saying that the confrontation “was just so in line with the history of colonization and appropriation” and another maintaining that “this seems like the latest iteration of using religion to beat Native people in the head”.

As the controversy unfolded, Post opinion writer Paul Waldman weighed in on why Trump felt “overjoyed” by it. It was, Waldman wrote, because it allowed him and conservative commentators to fire up the base with “the same metanarrative” they have been feeding it for years – that “white people, men and Christians are the only remaining victims of racial discrimination”. Liberals have their own “outrage system” but it is “much more decentralized and ad hoc” than the conservative one, which “was built for this very purpose”. The article made no mention of the death threats that Sandmann and his school were receiving nor of the calls on social media for Covington students to be doxed, punched in the face, and fed to a woodchipper (as proposed by film producer Jack Morrissey).

On the opinion pages, Post editorial board member Jonathan Capehart devoted not one but two columns to condemning Sandmann and his fellow students. The added context provided by the longer video, he insisted, did nothing to diminish the despicable nature of their actions. Likening Sandmann’s “smirk” to “the Kavanaugh scowl”, he wrote: “Ask just about anyone who is not straight, white and male what they see in that smirk and you’ll most likely open up a world of hurt,” including “memories of continual bullying and other abuse at the hands of entitled men and boys who weren’t or never feared being held accountable”.

Finally, Robin Givhan, the Post’s fashion critic, penned a polemic denouncing the MAGA hat and its status as “an inflammatory declaration of identity”. The aesthetically benign baseball cap, she wrote, has been transformed into “an open wound, a firestorm of hate and a marker of societal atavism”. It’s an “angry roar” that’s been “weaponized” into “a symbol of us vs them, exclusion and suspicion, of garrulous narcissism, of white male privilege, of violence and hate”. Again, there was no mention of the angry roar that had been directed at Sandmann, nor of the firestorm of hate that had forced him and his family to live in a constant state of concern over their safety.

On 13 February, an independent investigative firm hired by the Covington diocese released its report on the incident. It found “no evidence” that the students had made “offensive or racist” statements or chanted “built the wall”. It did, however, find that some of the students had done a “tomahawk chop” while Phillips was chanting. But even if one accepts that Sandmann was smirking and that the Covington students were rowdy, does that warrant the whirlwind of fury and bitterness that the Post and other news organizations helped to unleash on them? Is it fair to implicate this 16-year-old in 500 years of Catholic oppression of Native Americans or in generations of bullying of blacks, gays and women? Don’t the attacks on him qualify as their own form of bullying?

The Post ran columns by Megan McArdle and Kathleen Parker that made this point. “All things considered,” Parker wrote, “this potentially combustible situation was relatively innocuous compared with what transpired afterward via social and other media … how many times must we witness these rushes to judgement before skepticism gets a chance to show off?”

We live in an era of hatred, incitement and bitter polarization, all skillfully stoked by Donald Trump. Journalists have to do their best not to succumb to it."

They created this game for their own entertainment. The “big cheese” is in a duffel bag over 500 miles away at a train station in New Mexico. The six participants took to the airplanes, trains, and backwoods just to claim the spoils. As you can imagine, this was a total disaster as people’s greed and self-aggrandizement took over their more noble character. They would do anything to win the “big cheese” — especially after being told by the conspirator, “There are no rules” to this Rat Race. No rules? Hmm.

Fast forward to the Windy City. Jussie Smollett, a biracial actor/musician and self-proclaimed homosexual, took to social media claiming two Trump supporters wearing Make America Great Again hats assaulted him. He said they doused him with bleach, called him racial and homosexual slurs, and put a noose around his neck on the streets of Chicago. Really? On first take, this sounded suspect at best, but how could this even make headlines with people actually believing it?

As in “Rat Race,” there are “no rules” to winning the “big cheese.” In this case, becoming the victim is winning the spoils. There are no limits to the despicable measures the liberals will use to concoct another emotional racial fairy tale. Even the boy who cried wolf was eventually ignored and eaten alive because of his love affair with victimhood. Fortunately, the two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were paid to conspire the attack on Smollett came out and said: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

The Rat Race toward victimization is the new conquest, triumph, or victory in America, especially for the Left. No longer is becoming a victor over oppression, regression, or suppression seen as the ultimate goal. For Jussie Smollett, being a liar to smear President Trump and gain notoriety from liberals was worth it. Smollett knew that, as a “black man,” he could use a “white lie” to hide behind his own misery and “the people” would believe it. He did it because it works in today’s media culture!

As the boy who cried wolf ended in demise, he will have a similar fate as he cries “racism” — his career and integrity will be in question."

GoFundMe’s fine print says the crowdfunding site cannot be used for “campaigns we deem, in our sole discretion, to be in support of, or for the legal defense of alleged crimes associated with hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination, terrorism, or intolerance of any kind relating to race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity, or serious disabilities or diseases.”

Critics might say that covers a lot of ground. Some would argue a campaign “in support of” hate crimes is not the same as a campaign for the legal defense of someone accused of them. Of course, GoFundMe is a private corporation and is under no legal obligation to help anyone raise any money for anything.

Daryl Hatton, CEO of crowdfunding rival ConnectionPoint, notes that crowdfunding companies can’t raise money to pay for someone’s bail. “Raising money for bail is prohibited by the payment processors and the credit-card companies,” he says. “As crowdfunding platforms we have to comply with these prohibitions.” (The prohibition apparently doesn’t apply to nonprofit groups and companies like Facebook FB, +1.26% , which hosted campaigns to raise bail money for immigrant families detained at the border last summer.)

GoFundMe has a variety of rules regarding who can raise money for what on its site. Most of the forbidden activities are not controversial. You can’t launch GoFundMe campaigns for anything illegal. You can’t use it for ransom. You can’t use it to sell counterfeit goods. You can’t use it to finance political campaigns or sell unregulated financial products. You can’t use it for fraud.

But legal defenses are, well, legal. Indeed they are guaranteed by the constitution, even in the case of violent crimes, and heinous crimes, such as alleged sex with minors.

At the moment there are GoFundMe campaigns on behalf of Roger Stone, Michael Cohen, “justice for Jussie” Smollett, and for Paul Manafort. (Money raised for Manafort so far: $5.) None are accused of violent crimes, but all are accused of serious offenses.

One awkward question raised by GoFundMe’s policies is what would happen if a poor, unknown person — someone without fame or rich friends — found themselves wrongly accused of a violent crime. Under the company’s rules, as applied in the case of Kelly, it would seem that they, too, might be unable to raise defense funds on the platform.

The paradox is that if R. Kelly had used GoFundMe to pay his legal bills during his battles with the Internal Revenue Service, he might now have some money to pay for his legal defense against charges of sex with minors. GoFundMe rules say nothing about legal defense funds for fighting the IRS.

Meanwhile rival GoGetFunding says its doors are open. “We have hosted a number of legal defense campaigns on our site — including those for murder, serious crimes, controversial political cases and more,” says a spokeswoman.

She added, “I have already spoken with the CEO, who is in agreement that we would allow such a campaign as we are an impartial site that allows those facing legal costs the opportunity to raise funds from their family, friends and supporters in order to ensure they are able to employ the best legal defense they can afford — as is their absolute right.”

“We are not a legal platform and therefore will never act as judge and jury for any defendant who chooses to use our site,” she said. “That will be for the court system to determine. Our role is to ensure those facing legal costs have the chance to be represented fairly and adequately.”

How much a campaign for R. Kelly might raise is another matter."

13 Republicans joined with Democrats to admonish Trump’s move — well short of the number Democrats would need to overturn the president’s promised veto.

As The Hill reports, the vote marks the first time Congress has taken formal action to block a presidential emergency declaration since the power was created in the National Emergencies Act of 1976.

Democrats hinged their opposition on the basic principles of constitutional law, arguing that Trump’s unilateral move marks a clear-cut violation of the separation of powers and the unique authority of Congress to dictate where federal dollars are spent.

“If it were truly an emergency we’d all be there with the president,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said several hours before Tuesday’s vote, during a conference of the American Legion in Washington. “Our founders had great vision. They did not want a king.”

As a reminder, here’s a list of all the national emergencies…

…and since the National Emergencies Act went into effect in the mid-1970s, a total of 58 have been declared, most of which were in regard to foreign issues (like the War in Iraq).



Jussie Smollett has been charged with a crime after his false report went viral. Erich “Mancow” Muller joins Alex to discuss the real victims of this crime including himself as a Trump supporter living in Chicago.

“People will say, ‘Well, there have been a lot of emergency designations.’ That’s right,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). “This is the only one — the only one — that has been used to get around a Congress’s refusal to appropriate money for a particular objective.”

The Hill points out that passage in the upper chamber is not guaranteed, but appears increasingly likely. Three GOP senators — Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Tom Tillis (N.C.) — are already on record in support of the disapproval resolution, and a handful of others are leaning that way.

The president, for his part, has vowed in no uncertain terms to veto the resolution if it travels that far. Neither chamber is expected to have enough support to win a two-thirds vote to override the promised veto.

“They’re not going to be able to reverse this emergency declaration. But it does show that they’re in denial that there’s a crisis at the border,” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) told The Hill ahead of the vote. “Pelosi goes to the border and waves a Mexican flag saying there’s no crisis the same week that an illegal alien goes to Napa right in her own backyard and attacks a cop,” he continued. “I mean it’s it’s happening every day. There’s a real crisis and the president is taking steps to keep our country safe.”

No matter, what, Trump already called the endgame – “we’ll see you in the Supreme Court.”

Original Story:

When Americans think of the risk of nuclear war, they often think of North Korea or Iran in their pursuits of nuclear weapons that can strike the United States. Others might look to Russia or China, the two largest nuclear arsenals that are both capable of striking the United States today. We rarely consider the most volatile potential nuclear standoff in the world right now between India and Pakistan.

This is a mistake made by American media, as the tensions between India and Pakistan have been the most likely catalyst for a nuclear war since both nations acquired nuclear weapons capabilities. If World War III starts any time in the near future, it will likely start in south Asia between these nuclear neighbors.

Tensions have been high for decades and reached a critical tipping point two weeks ago following a terrorist attack in Kashmir. Since then, there have been exchanges between the two sides, including an air strikes on terrorist training camps by India’s air force and the downing of two Indian fighter jets yesterday.

One of the aircraft fell inside AJ&K while other fell inside IOK. One Indian pilot arrested by troops on ground while two in area: DG ISPR — Govt of Pakistan (@pid_gov) February 27, 2019



The geopolitics surrounding this conflict are as complicated as they get. Both governments are considered friendly with Washington DC, though there have been diplomatic conflicts with Pakistan’s government in recent years.

China is not officially allied with Pakistan, but that’s just on paper. They have strong ties with Islamabad and consider their neighbors in India to be a major potential threat.

Russia, like the U.S., has relationships with both sides, but may lean towards Pakistan if push comes to shove.

Could a war start between India and Pakistan soon? If things don’t deescalate quickly, it seems almost inevitable. Both sides are leaving room for deescalation despite the increased military activity, but they have gone to war in the past with less provocation. There seem to be two possible ways for this to turn into a nuclear war.

Scenario 1: Pakistan counters Indian military incursions with tactical nuclear weapons

Pakistan is the only nuclear armed nation that does not have a policy against first nuclear strikes. All other nuclear armed nations (other than Israel, which denies having a nuclear arsenal) state as national policy that they will never use nuclear weapons unless nuclear weapons are used against them first.

Nobody knows what the threshold is for Pakistan to use their nuclear weapons. This is by design. Because India’s conventional military forces both outnumber and are better equipped than Pakistan’s, they’ve always used the threat of nuclear weapons as their countermeasure to India’s superiority. This is similar to NATO’s stance against Russia through the Cold War. Russia was militarily capable of running over Europe through sheer size, but the presence of nuclear weapons in Europe was always viewed as the balance.

Pakistan views their nuclear arsenal the same way. They may not be able to stop India head-to-head in a conventional war, but they would be willing to nuke Indian forces, possibly even within their own borders if necessary. If this current conflict continues to escalate and India gets more aggressive with their military strikes, Pakistan may feel it necessary to use tactical nuclear weapons to level the playing field.

Scenario 2: India fears a nuclear strike so they preemptively attack known launch facilities in a counterforce offensive

If diplomacy breaks down, either through escalation of military strikes and counterstrikes or through a terrorist attack similar to the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai, it’s very possible pressure for action by the vast Indian population would result in an attempt by India to take out Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities before they’re able to use them. India has extremely accurate ordinance delivery systems that are capable of pinpoint strikes. They also have intelligence about all of Pakistan’s launch facilities… at least they hope they have information on all of them. Combine those two ingredients with a strong, albeit untested missile defense system and we may have a recipe for a counterforce offensive.

This scenario would make it much more likely China would get involved early. They may view the action against Pakistan as a precursor to action against Chinese nuclear facilities. If that’s their perspective, they may attempt to take out India’s nuclear capabilities shortly after India takes out Pakistan’s.

America would be drawn in

Two things are certain about America’s response to a nuclear war regardless of how it starts. First, there is very little chance anyone will want to get involved directly in a nuclear war in south Asia. Second, any action by either Russia or China would make it nearly impossible for us to stay out of it. Nearly 1/5th of the world’s population is in India and Pakistan. The economic fallout from any nuclear war in the region would be crippling to much of the developed world.

Public sentiment will initially demand that we stay as far away from the conflict as possible. If India is able to take out Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities without China getting involved, it’s possible we could stay out of the conflict and focus on building a lasting peace. But that may be wishful thinking. India is strong and technologically advanced, but it’s hard to imagine them completely incapacitating Pakistan. It’s even harder to imagine China not getting involved.

Fight fake news. Support NOQ Report.

The most unpredictable components are the terrorist organizations on both sides. Pakistan has multiple Islamic terrorist groups that want India out of Kashmir. India has Hindu terrorist groups that want a deeper separation from Muslims, a goal that becomes easier to achieve through a war with Pakistan. Meanwhile, the Islamic State and al Qaeda are still active in the region and would love to see these countries at war.

Any one terrorist organization could engage in an operation that prompts either or both sides of the conflict to get more aggressive.

If tensions are not brought down quickly, war seems inevitable. While American attentions are directed towards Michael Cohen’s testimony or Jussie Smollett’s latest claims, WWIII may be ramping up in south Asia. From there, it will spread. We need to be watching.

At the end of January, #wearealljussie was a trending hashtag. Writers crafted think pieces about the very real violence QTPOC (Queer, Trans People Of Color) face, supporting Smollett's decision to file a report and to be vocal about his attack.

Two week ago, I wrote about Smollett, and ended the piece with this thought: Waiting for the invisible to be made visible through a body with celebrity status means that many more of us are harmed, and die, in silence.

Despite the roller coaster that the Smollett case has become, I remain convinced that fame, and the privileges that come along with it, will not save QTPOC.

There is an inherent flaw to the logic that Smollet’s hate crime, if concocted and false, will somehow negatively impact others who share his identities: It assumes that society was already listening to marginalized voices enduring violence. History and statistics tell us that this isn’t the case and that believing and supporting QTPOC survivors is the exception and not the norm.

Positing Smollett as the reason why QTPOC won’t be heard ignores how QTPOC are systemically silenced in the first place and places the onus on a person of color instead of on white supremacy.

Whether or not Smollett made it up is irrelevant for me at this point. But the initial support of Smollett and the lack of support for other QTPOC survivors unearths a glaring truth about culture. We find worth in the cultural relevancy of a person and we think that their social capital and influence will somehow speak or change things for us. Sometimes, it does work that way and many times, it doesn’t.

“The task is to transform society,” activist and revolutionary Huey P. Newton said in his book, “Revolutionary Suicide.” “Only the people can do that — not heroes, not celebrities, not stars.” Newton makes a salient point. Celebrities are effigies of our culture. They are corporeal representations of our society's engagement with itself.

However, that representation is not a reflection of reality.

Celebrity culture is an extension of the heavily muscled arm of capitalism, reaching to commodify our attention. Their unique position in society make them optimal vehicles to drive forward marketing, advertising and even political campaigns.

That’s not to say that being a celebrity doesn’t have disadvantages. It does, as does every other cultural signifier of wealth and class. But being a celebrity means having access to resources, such as wealth and social capital, that cushion the realities of systemic disenfranchisement.

Smollett's name brought up important dialogue about the intersections of racism and queerphobia and the erasure that happens at its junction.

Before Smollett's attack, a threatening, homophobic letter addressed to Smollett was delivered to Fox Studios in Chicago. In response, ""Empire"" hired armed security guards to protect the staff and cast of the show and offered 24/7 personal guards to Smollett. He allegedly turned the offer down. The irony of it now seems cruel. The situation inspired plenty of white supremacists and queerphobic vitriol — something the actor addressed in his dramatic Good Morning America interview.

As the facts piled up, it got harder and harder for supporters to find validity in Smollett's story. Tethered to our dedication to addressing injustice, we refused to silence another marginalized voice. But Smollett's actions capitalized on a movement built and sustained by QTPOC, who are harmed the most by hate crimes.

Most QTPOC don’t have the resources or access to be provided with or to hire security teams to ensure their safety. Certainly, most don’t have the connections to get a Good Morning America interview or to drop new music almost immediately after an attack.

In fact, many QTPOC don’t report hate crimes in the first place because of the fear of judgement and discrimination from the police force. The amount of support Smollett cultivated was staggering but it revealed how readily politicians and other famous figures will mobilize when another socially visible person experiences violence.

Where’s this cavalry of support when non-famous QTPOC are victims of hate crimes?

Actress Laverne Cox spoke on this stark difference in realities in an interview last year. “I understand that I’m very lucky,” she said. “I understand that I’ve been chosen. It makes me sad … It’s very intense.”

Although Smollett didn’t create the systems that silence or erase QTPOC, he is now complicit in perpetuating them. He was intentional in his exploitation of his identity in ways that have a rippling impact on other QTPOC who don’t share his fame or wealth.

However, the eagerness with which Smollet was crucified is just as telling as his hoax. Smollett isn’t the first person to lie about a hate crime yet somehow, the rhetoric is that this highly publicized instance will harm all QTPOC. This rhetoric isn’t present when white perpetrators file false police reports or call law enforcement on POC for non-criminal activity.

We cannot expect celebrities to lead us in movement. While they may play an important role in disseminating the messages of movements, celebrities cannot be the loci of activism. If celebrities are centered, the movement crumbles when the person does, leaving the marginalized vulnerable in the wreckage."

But the danger of such an outrageous and dangerous performance could have been worse. He could have falsely claimed that his assailants were….. Jews. Just think about it. That could have ignited nationwide riots, reminiscent of violence perpetrated by mobs of blacks in Ferguson and in Baltimore, but this time targeting Jews. A calamity of epic proportions would have ensued. The current overt Jew hating boldly being displayed by blacks not only on the streets of NYC but around the nation in our colleges and sadly enough, in Congress are warning signs we cannot further ignore.

The physical attacks on local Lubavitch/Hassidim, by blacks, although increasing in volume and intensity, is barely reported in the New York Times, Daily News or the electronic media. “Some 10 people were violently attacked in the last 60 days alone,” said Rabbi Yaacov Behrman, who heads the Brooklyn, Crown Heights based, “Jewish Future Alliance.” The Aitz HaChaim synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh is still fresh and vivid in our minds. Overt Jew hating and its growing accompanying violence is on the rise.

One has to merely look at the likes of Al Sharpton, the demon behind the 1991 Crown Heights Black rioting that left Yankel Rosenbaum dead of stab wounds. Sharpton eventually soared in prominence as a final contender for the 2008 Democrat Presidential nomination, was hired as a top commentator for MSNBC News and became a major advisor to President Obama. You have the shocking photo 2005 of then senator Obama standing proudly by the side of Louis Farrakhan at a Black Congressional Caucus get-together. Put all of these ominous omens together and we’re holding our breaths that another prominent Black or gay personage looking for headlines does not scapegoat Jews by claiming they violently physically or verbally attacked him/her. Just thinking."

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” ”Empire” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The series, on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged.

“Empire” has nine episodes left to air in its fifth season; the last two episodes are still being worked on. The show returns from its winter break on March

Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars.

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” ”Empire” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The series, on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged.

Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars.

When most Americans think of lynching, they summon images of the horrific murders of American blacks, particularly in the years of the Jim Crow South. To describe such murders as ""bias-motivated acts of terror,"" as Cory Booker has, would certainly be accurate. ""This bill,"" Booker says, ""will not undo the damage,"" but it ""will acknowledge the wrongs in our history. It will honor the memories of those brutally killed."" So, when Senate Democrats offered their proposed new law, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018, I had assumed that it would be a symbolic congressional action to recognize these injustices that took place and to honor the victims. Considering that the act passed the Senate unanimously, that's likely what most senators also believed.

But that's not what the act is, and that's certainly not its intent. The real purpose of the act appears to be the legal redefining of the word ""lynching"" to include a include a much broader scope of lesser crimes, and to grow the federal government's power to prosecute these lesser crimes that it includes in its new definition. Lynching is not a problem in the United States anymore, and the language of the act affirms that fact unequivocally. The act cites that at least ""4,742 people, predominantly black African-Americans, were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968."" The act then goes on to describe efforts by Congress before 1968 to ""end lynching,"" and it also references its efforts since 1968 to ""apologize to the victims of lynching and their descendants."" But never once does the initial ""findings"" section of the act suggest that acts of lynching are still prevalent, therefore requiring new powers or correction today, because no data as to lynching in America are provided beyond the year of 1968. These numbers cited appear to have been drawn from a study by the Tuskegee Institute, which defines lynching thusly: ""There must be legal evidence that a person was killed. That person must have met death illegally. A group of three or more persons must have participated in the killing. The group must have acted under the pretext of service to justice, race or tradition."" So even in the definition used by the only study that the act cites, there is admission that ""lynching"" is not defined explicitly as a race-related crime. That same study finds that nearly 1,300 whites were lynched in that same timeframe who likely weren't murdered because they were white. Consider the lynching of the notorious Ruggles brothers. In May of 1892, brothers John and Charles Ruggles were captured after robbing a stagecoach in Northern California. While they were imprisoned in Redding, California, it had become apparent that the two young outlaws were quite the hit with the ladies around town, who brought the men flowers, cakes, and ""even offers of marriage."" That didn't sit too well with other men around town, so four days before their official trial, a group of masked men grabbed them from their cell in Redding and hanged them from a derrick without trial. That is a perfectly fitting example of a lynching, albeit not one that most would conjure when hearing the word. The point is, the word has always had a specific, practical meaning, and it is nothing like the one Senate Democrats are presenting. Here's something interesting to consider. The alleged attack against Jussie Smollett would certainly not, in the commonly understood definition throughout history, be considered a ""lynching."" But it would fit the definition of a ""lynching"" in the Democrats' newly proposed law. The act appropriates for the federal government the right to completely remove the most basic requirements for a crime to be defined as a ""lynching,"" now declaring that a ""lynching"" is any act where ""2 or more persons willfully cause bodily injury to any other person, because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of any person."" According to this definition, a Hasidic Jew being punched by two black guys is now to be defined by the same word we've used for decades to describe a mob of racist whites hanging an innocent black man. The language of the act then becomes very careful. It continues with a separate clause defining lynching to include attacks based upon the ""gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of any person."" That language mirrors, verbatim, that used in the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. The only difference is that one or more people committing to such an attack is a ""hate crime,"" according to the previous legislation's description of the crime. Now, when two or more people do the same thing, it's a ""lynching."" Some Americans took notice of the illogical inclusion of attacks against gays or transgenders as an example of ""lynching."" After all, isn't this bill ostensibly meant to ""honor the victims"" of the actual travesty of lynching in America? And there is not one cited historical precedent in the bill of lynching suffered by homosexuals or transgenders. Activist Tariq Nasheed went so far as to suggest that the attack against Jussie Smollett, a black gay man, aligns too perfectly with these added non sequiturs to address the ""lynching"" of gay Americans. He suggests that Kamala Harris was involved in Smollett's orchestrating the hoax, ostensibly to justify the inclusion of language defining any attack ""meant to do bodily harm"" by ""2 or more people"" due to the victim's sexual orientation as a ""lynching."" The coincidences of Jussie Smollett's alleged attack aligning perfectly with the curious language of Democrats' proposed anti-lynching law don't end there. It is broadly imagined by the proponents of limitless government expansion that regulating crimes of race-related bias is a federally protected power that derives from the Thirteenth Amendment's allowing Congress the power to eliminate the ""badges, incidents, and relics"" of slavery. But the federal power to prosecute crimes motivated by non-race-related bias relies primarily upon the Commerce Clause. Therefore, the act also includes the same ridiculous caveats as previous federal hate crime legislation to justify such intrusion into the jurisdiction of the states. For any of these attacks against a homosexual or transgender person to be deemed a ""lynching,"" and therefore federally prosecutable under the new law, the defendant or victim must be traveling ""across State or national lines"" or utilize a ""channel, facility, or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce in connection"" to the crime, or using a ""a firearm, dangerous weapon, explosive or incendiary device,"" or interfering ""with commercial or other economic activity in which the victim is engaged at the time"" of the attack. That same language, again, exists almost verbatim in the 2009 Hate Crime Prevention Act. Here's what's new: according to the ""Justice for the Victims of Lynching Act,"" if the attack occurs ""during the course of, or as a result of,"" the ""defendant or the victim ... using a phone, the internet,"" or ""the mail,"" then the crime might now be subject to federal prosecution under the new law. Jussie Smollett claimed to be on the phone with his manager when he was allegedly attacked. Since he claimed that he was attacked for his race, this crime would be subject to federal prosecution under the new law for that alone — again, due to law's assumption of federal jurisdiction by the Thirteenth Amendment. But the fact that he was on the phone, and that the alleged attackers could be seen as interfering with his ""economic activity,"" would make the fact that he was allegedly attacked for his sexual orientation also federally prosecutable for that reason. While it may signify nothing more, there are marvelous coincidences in the circumstances of Jussie Smollett's hate crime hoax and the circumstances described in the language of the act, which would legally deem it the ""modern day lynching"" that Kamala Harris immediately claimed it was. It is not hyperbole to say that this language in the Democrats' proposed law makes a mockery of every victim of an actual lynching in America's history. They are using the horrific legacy of lynching against blacks in the Jim Crow South to advance a political agenda that has nothing to do with honoring the murdered victims of historical racism and everything to do with advancing federal power and identity politics at the expense of the memory of the true historical victims of racism. But I have to admit, it's pretty brilliant of them, politically. It has become sadly apparent that Congress doesn't read the legislation it considers. Since no one will read the bill, how could anyone possibly be against a ""Justice for the Victims of Lynching Act""? William Sullivan blogs at Political Palaver and can be followed on Twitter."

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” ”Empire” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The series, on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars.

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” ”Empire” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The series, on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

The series, on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars.

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” ”Empire” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The series, on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

The series, on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars.

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” ”Empire” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The series, on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged.

“Empire” has nine episodes left to air in its fifth season; the last two episodes are still being worked on. The show returns from its winter break on March

Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

Reaction was swift from the people on social media, particularly among Trumpist Republicans who were outraged that an entertainment industry figure would use race, politics, deceit and fabrication to divide people and take advantage of their differences to further his own career.

""I'm outraged that someone would create a false story about our side. Obviously, those nasty Dems and Liberals are behind this,"" said one man at a recent MAGA rally. ""Our exalted leader was right to criticize Smollett and the biased media who covered the story. He would never even consider using race, fear and division to help himself!"""

Williams'],https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/190220_Smollett.jpg,"['crime', 'good', 'kernel', 'black', 'hoax', 'racial', 'supporters', 'trump', 'hoaxes', 'students', 'college', 'hate']","Jussie Smollett, “Empire” actor, claimed that on Jan. 29, two masked men identifying themselves as Donald Trump supporters and using racial and homophobic insults attacked him. Smollett said the assailants yelled “This is MAGA country,” bashed his face, crushed his ribs, splashed him with bleach, and put a noose around his neck.

Smollett’s telling of the hate crime was gobbled up hook, line, and sinker by the anti-Trump news media, but Chicago police say it was a hoax.

This type of hoax is part and parcel of the left’s broad agenda of victimology, fraudulence, and gimmickry, plus gross media gullibility, incompetence, and political attention-seeking.

What’s so troublesome is the fact that despite considerable evidence that the incident was a hoax, no apologies have been issued to either the public or the targets of their malfeasance—Trump and the Americans who voted for him.

Racial hoaxes have been a major part of the leftist agenda going back decades. In 1987, the Rev. Al Sharpton created the Tawana Brawley hoax, wherein four white men were falsely accused of rape.

For perpetrating the hoax, Sharpton was rewarded by receiving national recognition, millions of dollars, and a career as a television/radio talk show host, and he ran for president in 2004. He also received 82 invitations to advise Barack Obama’s White House on matters of race.

Most of the nation’s racial hoaxes take place on college campuses. Recall the 2006 Duke lacrosse rape case, in which three affluent white male Duke students were falsely accused of raping a black female stripper.

Police exposed Bowling Green State University student Eleesha Long as a liar after she complained about being attacked by Trump supporters the day after his election.

At Goucher College in Maryland, scrawlings depicted swastikas and also spelled out the N-word and the names of four black students—including the perpetrator. The Maryland police found out that the perp was a 21-year-old black lacrosse player seeking victimhood.

Nonetheless, the incident led to protests, demands for designated safe spaces, and demands that incoming freshmen and transfers be required to take a “cultural competency” course.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has compiled some of the most outrageous hate crime hoaxes since Trump was elected. The hate crime hoaxes include claims of attacks on Muslim men and women by Trump supporters. A bisexual woman falsely claimed that Trump supporters were sending her nasty notes.

Most of the hate crime hoaxes have been committed by black students. Their charges include the posting of KKK signs, the sending of racist notes, and the writing of racist graffiti on a black person’s door with the words “Go Home N—– Boy” and “Whites Only.”

A black man was caught on camera spray-painting doors and vehicles with racial slurs, vulgar words, and swastikas.

Even professors create hoaxes. Indiana State University professor Azhar Hussain sent bogus anti-Muslim emails to himself, according to police, “trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself.” He was arrested for filing a false police report.

Here’s the good news about the racial hoaxes on the nation’s college campuses: Left-wing college students have a difficult time finding the actual racism they claim permeates college campuses. Thus, they have to invent it.

Though it has not been proved yet, these students may have support for their racial hoaxes by diversity-crazed administrators, who nationwide spend billions of dollars on diversity and a multiculturalist agenda. Racial discord and other kinds of strife are their meal tickets.

Black people, as well as homosexuals, should condemn these hoaxes, but so far, most have remained silent. If police are right that Smollett’s claims were a dastardly hoax, it will cause doubt to be cast on future real claims of assault based on race and sexual orientation. It also will have a negative impact on race relations.

This is not something to be taken lightly.

If Smollett is found guilty of a felony as he is charged, he should suffer heavy penalties, including jail time. There’s a lesson to be learned from one of Aesop’s fables, “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.”

Out of interest, I sat in.

The students, mostly around eighteen, seemed horrified by my friend’s apparent incompetence when she asked sincerely how they can know, for example, whether the world is round rather than flat.

Instead of thinking that the question might be deeper than it appears, the students presumed that my friend was one of those flat-earth enthusiasts who lurk online, or that she simply hadn’t done her due diligence.

The bravest of them vocalised these thoughts with a note of horror in his voice – “haven’t you researched this?” he asked shrilly. “Haven’t you read about this? It’s easy to know that the Earth is not flat – just look into it.”

The line between knowledge and belief is now blurrier and more undulating than at any point

Of course, my friend does not think the world is flat; she was attempting to get the students to think about what is actually involved in knowing something. ”Who in this room,” she enquired, “has empirically tested the hypothesis for themselves?”

No one answered in the affirmative. “The person who can prove the hypothesis knows in a way that I don’t,” she went on. “I’m not a scientist, so I take it on authority that they are right, but if knowing something entails fully understanding it, or being able to prove it, then I suppose I don’t know. Do you?”

The young man in the front who had spoken up earlier looked a bit perturbed.

The line between knowledge and belief is now blurrier and more undulating than at any point during my lifetime, and likely will be for a good deal longer than that. We rely on authorities to tell us or to reinforce what we know or should know, and sometimes what we should believe, but facts seem more ubiquitous and less delineated than ever.

The fact that there is a bizarre online movement of people who truly believe that the Earth is flat attests to that.

As a writer, I want to write about events in the world, and if I want to pay my bills, such writings are far more likely to find an interested publisher when those events are at their peak in the news cycle. However, I find myself more and more reluctant to participate in a social media cycle that seems increasingly rushed and overconfident about what is known.

In the last several weeks, we have seen Empire actor Jussie Smollett understandably sympathised with and supported all over social media and in papers when news emerged that he had been the target of a racially motivated attack.

It instantaneously spawned unreserved and furious public statements on what the incident said about the state of America today, until increasing evidence indicated that Smollett had lied about the attack.

Reflected through a lens of signalling and emotion, the truth can change shape

Not just deeply immoral, this is a heinous inflammation of bigotry on all sides at a delicate time for race relations in the US. Very little sympathy endures for people who falsely claim the special treatment afforded to victims of serious crimes like the one alleged.

Such people drain resources which should go to those who are legitimate victims, but they also impose on and disrespect the collective good will of society in a way which many find difficult to forgive.

It seems evident, given the number of recent examples in the news in which events or situations first appear one way, and then turn out (as most things usually do) to be more complex in reality, that the best response when consuming and contributing to online content is to slow down and wait for more information.

Sympathy for victims is appropriate, but we could also be generally more charitable – not just toward victims and those who are perceived as victims, but to the fallibility of human interpretation and understanding.

Reflected through a lens of signalling and emotion, the truth can change shape. It takes mindful awareness to protect our humanity and that of others, not to lash out, and to think about what it is to know something."

The easy answer is bias. And that might have even been the right answer a generation ago.

These days the media isn’t biased. It’s tribal.

Bias leads us to make mistakes. But the media wasn’t making a mistake when it loudly broadcast false claims with plenty of red flags about Trump supporters wearing red hats. Just as the media wasn’t making a mistake when it spread fake news about attacks on Muslim women by Trump supporters after the election. This wasn’t an error due to prejudice, but an active effort to reinforce tribal prejudices.

The Covington Catholic story in particular was not newsworthy by any rational definition of the term. The media insisted on making it news because it perfectly encapsulated the tribal prejudices of its base of urban and suburban lefties by pitting anti-abortion kids in MAGA hats against saintly minorities.

There’s another example of tribal hatred masquerading as news in the news now.

Prime Time Sports, a small sports memorabilia store in a Colorado Springs mall, announced that it was going out of business. Malls are emptying out across the country and there was no reason why the closing of a mall shop selling Cubs t-shirts and Patriots mini-helmets should have ended up in hundreds of papers around the country. But the reason why its closing ended up in major papers and news networks, including CNN. says a great deal about the malicious nature of political tribalism on the Left.

“A Colorado store that boycotted Nike after its Kaepernick ad will close,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette gloated about the misfortune of a mall store 1,400 miles away.

“He stopped selling Nike products because of Colin Kaepernick,” the Washington Post breathlessly reported. “Now his store is closing.”

The fate of a 2,000 square foot hole in the wall placeholder in a dying mall had somehow become of crucial interest to the opinion-shapers and policymakers of the nation’s capital. But when Kermit Gosnell, the abortion doctor suspected of hundreds of cases of infanticide, was on trial, the Post dismissed it as a “local crime” story. Those are the same tribal priorities that led the media to be outraged that Governor Northam wore blackface 34 years ago, but not that he now backed infanticide.

The headlines sum up why the national media found the closing of a mall shop so newsworthy. The owner had dared to buck the media’s tribal message that Colin Kaepernick was a civil rights hero. Going out of business was his punishment. It was a story of just deserts. A moral lesson for America.

Stand up to our social justice mega-corps and we will destroy you. And then dance on your grave.

Stories of ordinary people punished for their political views have slowly become a staple of the media. These often focus on some random person caught on video in what can be spun as a politically incorrect moment during a confrontation, and then being followed around by the cameras as their lives are destroyed. The Covington Catholic case is the most famous of these types of tribal humiliation stories.

Their existence says everything about where the media, its parent leftist movement and America are.

In a liberal society, people from different tribes can agree to disagree because they recognize their mutual humanity. In a tribal society, the ‘other’ is less than human. Tribal narratives are about the superiority of ‘our’ people to ‘their’ people. Outrage at selective incidents is used to dehumanize the ‘other’ tribe, to call for violence against them, and then to urge their utter destruction.

Or, as New York Times columnist Sarah Jeong once tweeted, “#CancelWhitePeople”.

Tribal superiority is reinforced through ritualistic acts of humiliation of the other side. Media stories like the one about a sports store in a failing mall going out of business ‘count coup’ on conservatives.

Once upon a time, America was a liberal society. And Americans were able to coexist together.

It’s easy to see what we have lost by what we now have. A tribal society is governed by mysteries and absolutes. Morality is relative and contradictory. The only real absolute truth is the superiority of the group. Divisions between tribes are therefore absolute. Unity is possible only against a common enemy.

[wpipa id=”94167″]

And so we’ve lost science and replaced it with scientism. Science was a set of techniques for testing the accuracy of answers. Scientism is the conviction that anything a politically correct PhD says about the entire planet or the universe must be believed with a religious fervor because it makes you a more moral person.

Religious tolerance and tolerance for all different ideas have also become casualties.

In a tribal society, the other tribe is evil because of its ancestry and beliefs. These two are intermingled, as they were in Nazi Germany or among the leftist exponents of ‘white privilege’. Your tribe is superior because of its ancestry and beliefs. The enemy tribe is evil because of its race and its beliefs.

Racial tolerance has been replaced by racial tribalism. Coexistence is held to be a physical impossibility. The new racial theorems claim that ‘whiteness’ and ‘blackness’ are in perpetual conflict, and that racial justice can only come by recognizing this conflict and doing everything possible to destroy ‘whiteness’.

There’s nothing progressive about this narrow-minded tribalism. Instead the ‘progressives’ have destroyed what was once a liberal society while declaring that their tribal hatreds and prejudices, their intolerance and refusal to listen to other points of view, are justified by tribal outrage and grievance.

All other forms of morality and justice have been supplanted by the tribal representation of ‘diversity’.

Tribal warfare begins with outrage, it escalates to raids and then to war. The media is already saturated with the tribal outrage of victimhood. The purpose of outrage is to declare something unacceptable. Media tribal outrage depicts almost any conservative views as unacceptable causes of tribal suffering. Every day, conservative views are responsible for the murder and oppression of minorities. Like Colin.

The next step in the tribal war is the raid. The raid is a brief skirmish that inflicts harm and humiliation on a tribal foe, demonstrating his weakness and the strength of the raiders. It raises the morale of the tribe, encouraging it to embark on a conflict, while weakening the morale of its targets to resist.

The media has been conducting these tribal raids for some time now. Over time the intentions behind them have become more explicit. Stories that reinforce the tribal conviction that conservatives are morally inferior give way to stories that seek to economically and even physically punish conservatives.

The journalists tweeting about Nick Sandmann of Covington Catholic and his “punchable face” were demonstrating that the ultimate purpose of tribal narratives about the evil of the ‘other’ in his MAGA cap is to escalate that outrage, demonstrations of inferiority and ritual humiliations into violence.

The deluge of disgust, contempt and hatred is a tide that can only wash up on one bloody shore.

Different tribes can coexist in a liberal society, they can separate in a federation whose divisions are governed by strict rules, or, hatred and anger will funnel them into an escalating tribal war.

The media is the voice of the leftist tribes reinforcing their identities, policing their boundaries and stirring up hatred, outrage and violence against the rest of the country. It lets no incident pass it by that it can use to stir up more tribal enmity, whether it is a boy in a red cap in Washington D.C. or a mall store closing in Colorado Springs. It has become the greatest enemy of a tolerant and open society.

A week after GMA aired her exclusive interview with Jussie Smollett, Robin Roberts says she’s not happy that the 36-year-old Empire actor lied to her face.

“It’s a setback for race relations [and] homophobia,” she said Thursday. “I cannot think of another case where there’s this anger on so many sides, and you can understand why there would be.”

Roberts added that “the fingers were pointed” at MAGA supporters in an unfair way.

Coming up next this Thursday morn @GMA my interview with @JussieSmollett. He gives a detailed account of what happened that night in Chicago. In our last hour…you'll hear his message to young gay youth and the LGBTQ community. — Robin Roberts (@RobinRoberts) February 14, 2019

Earlier in the week, Roberts defended her decision to interview Smollett, saying that, given the information she had at the time, she had no reason to think he was being dishonest with her.

“We have to remember, at that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative,” she said.

“Now this was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers (Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo Osundairo, who told police Smollett paid them to help him stage the attack).”

Coming up this Thursday morn GMA @JussieSmollett has turned himself in and is now in custody…charged with a felony. We’ll have the latest details…@DanAbrams and @sunny will join to discuss. — Robin Roberts (@RobinRoberts) February 21, 2019

And while this is certainly true, Robins can’t be blamed for something she didn’t know, The Blast reports that some GMA staffers had their suspicions.

The Blast reports:

According to our sources, some of the people who were in the room during the interview felt the validity of Smollett’s story was “up in the air” after his conversation with Roberts. Our sources say when Smollett and his team left the room after the interview was completed, there was immediately a feeling among the “GMA” staffers that something about Smollett’s story was amiss. We’re told the interview came about because Smollett approached “GMA” about doing the sit-down, which was a very coveted interview to score. Our sources say Smollett specifically requested Robin Roberts for the interview because the two had a history together–Roberts appeared on an episode of “Empire” that aired in April 2018.

After turning himself into police, Jussie Smollett posted $100,000 bail yesterday and has since been released from custody. Meanwhile, the producers of Empire have stated that Smollett has been suspended from the series for the remainder of the season.

Noah took to the airwaves dissecting every detail of the case against Smollett. The actor allegedly faked a homophobic and racist attack on January 29 to boost his profile and demand a salary increase on the Fox series Empire.

“They’re saying he paid his accomplices with a check,” Noah noted. “What, did he write ‘fake hate crime’ in the memo?” Noah steamed. He went on to needle Smollett for paying for a crime with a check, which is easily traceable by police. Noah further ripped Smollett for planning to get the crime on camera, only to discover the surveillance camera in the area wasn’t actually pointing at the scene. “You’ve got to be sh*tting me. He wanted to be caught on camera but didn’t know which way the camera was pointing? You’re an actor. That’s your only job!”

In the final moments of his monologue, Noah noted the real cost of the Smollett hoax: that he terrified queer and people of color with his story, angered Trump supporters for trying to frame them for the crime and embarrassed political figures who referred to the crime as a “lynching.” Noah noted, however, that the Smollett story began as one about people who hated the actor for his skin color and sexuality. Now, Noah notes, “people hate him because he’s an asshole. They’re judging him on the content of his character, not his skin. And that, my friends, is progress.”

The sad thing: Noah has a point. Jussie Smollett posted $100,000 bail on Thursday and has since been released from custody. Meanwhile, the producers of Empire have stated that Smollett has been suspended from the series for the remainder of the season."

Fox TV drama Empire actor Jussie Smollett plays on the show the gay character Jamal Lyon. In real life, Smollett is an African-American gay male who has been charged with concocting an elaborate racist and homophobic assault against him. Smollett’s fan base, needless to say, is flummoxed. So, too, are many Americans trying to push through this deeply polarized moment.

The big question now is about whether Smollett’s case will affect public perception of hate crimes, especially impacting people of color and LGBTQ communities. As one of millions of online commenters suggested, “Jussie has essentially set back the progression of both black folk and the LGBTQ community all while playing right into the hands of MAGA.”

When his story first came out, Smollett had a groundswell of support. Specifically, he said he was assaulted by two men in the wee hours of the morning who shouted, “This is MAGA country” and who put a noose around his neck. The investigation, however, has disclosed that Smollett knew the two Nigerian-American men involved, one of whom has appeared on the Empire. Smollett reportedly paid the two men $3,500 to attack him, while the rope to make the noose was bought at a nearby hardware store and the bruises on his face and body were self-inflicted.

In the time since those developments came out, I have been asking myself the same question as Chicago Chief Police Eddie Johnson, who said during a press conference, “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make a false accusation?” Smollett’s hoax dredges up the country’s horrors of lynching and gay bashing. For me, as an African-American lesbian, three hate crime incidents came to my mind immediately: Emmett Till, James Byrd, and Matthew Shepard. Till was lynched in Money, Mississippi, in 1955, and Byrd in Jasper, Texas, in 1998. Byrd’s killing was called a “lynching-by-dragging.” Shepard was gay-bashed to death in Laramie, Wyoming, in 1998.

Despite the recent news, Smollett is still seen as innocent in the eyes of many American-Americans—straight and LGBTQ. Despite the many inconsistencies in his story, there are communities of people of color in urban cities that have every reason not to trust the police. Chicago is still recovering from the wounds of the cover-up around the shooting of Laquan McDonald, who in 2014 was fatally shot 16 times by white Chicago Officer Jason Van Dyke. Van Dyke lied about the threat posed by McDonald and was backed up by fellow officers, but was then shown to have lied when dashcam video of the shooting came out.

“I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility?” Selma film director Ava DuVernay tweeted. “That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

In many of these communities, it is perceived that Smollett has no chance of getting a fair trial. Instead, he will be seen as another victim heading toward the country’s industrial prison complex, which disproportionately holds men of color.

While Smollett’s alleged crime will regrettably affect public perception of hate crimes, it shouldn’t. There has been an uptick of bias-related incidents and actual hate crimes since Donald Trump became POTUS, from white people calling the police on blacks for no good reason, to the defacement of synagogues and even worshippers being killed. Smollett’s hoax has no doubt has tapped into our fears about safety and our concerns for a country this polarized.

All reports of hate crimes should be taken seriously. One hoax is no excuse for law enforcement not to do their job. Or for people to avoid reporting them. To believe that Smollett’s actions make it so that people of color and LGBTQs can’t come forward in the future to report hate crimes is to buy too easily into the notion that one bad apple spoils the whole bunch.

Such a belief is bias in and of itself, and suggests people of color and LGBTQs are a hoax-perpetrating monolith. Smollett may well have suckered us all, but it would be a crime to let his fraudulent actions take away from any actual hate crimes being taken seriously."

Jussie Smollett, “Empire” actor, claimed that on Jan. 29, two masked men identifying themselves as Donald Trump supporters and using racial and homophobic insults attacked him. Smollett said the assailants yelled “This is MAGA country,” bashed his face, crushed his ribs, splashed him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. Smollett’s telling of the hate crime was gobbled up hook, line and sinker by the anti-Trump news media, but Chicago police say it was a hoax. This type of hoax is part and parcel of the left’s broad agenda of victimology, fraudulence and gimmickry, plus gross media gullibility, incompetence and political attention seeking. What’s so troublesome is the fact that despite considerable evidence that the incident was a hoax, no apologies have been issued to either the public or the targets of their malfeasance — President Trump and the Americans who voted for him.

Racial hoaxes have been a major part of the leftist agenda going back decades. In 1987, the Rev. Al Sharpton created the Tawana Brawley hoax, wherein four white men were falsely accused of rape. For perpetrating the hoax, Sharpton was rewarded by receiving national recognition, millions of dollars and a career as a television/radio talk show host, and he ran for president in 2004. He also received 82 invitations to advise Barack Obama’s White House on matters of race.

Most of the nation’s racial hoaxes take place on college campuses. Recall the 2006 Duke lacrosse rape case, in which three affluent white male Duke students were falsely accused of raping a black female stripper. Police exposed Bowling Green State University student Eleesha Long as a liar after she complained about being attacked by Trump supporters the day after his election. At Goucher College in Maryland, scrawlings depicted swastikas and also spelled out the N-word and the names of four black students — including the perpetrator. The Maryland police found out that the perp was a 21-year-old black lacrosse player seeking victimhood. Nonetheless, the incident led to protests, demands for designated safe spaces and demands that incoming freshmen and transfers be required to take a “cultural competency” course.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has compiled some of the most outrageous hate crime hoaxes since Trump was elected. The hate crime hoaxes include claims of attacks on Muslim men and women by Trump supporters. A bisexual woman falsely claimed that Trump supporters were sending her nasty notes. Most of the hate crime hoaxes have been committed by black students. Their charges include the posting of KKK signs, the sending of racist notes and the writing of racist graffiti on a black person’s door with the words “Go Home N— Boy” and “Whites Only.” A black man was caught on camera spray-painting doors and vehicles with racial slurs, vulgar words and swastikas.

Even professors create hoaxes. Indiana State University professor Azhar Hussain sent bogus anti-Muslim emails to himself, according to police, “trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself.” He was arrested for filing a false police report.

Here’s the good news about the racial hoaxes on the nation’s college campuses: Left-wing college students have a difficult time finding the actual racism they claim permeates college campuses. Thus, they have to invent it. Though it has not been proved yet, these students may have support for their racial hoaxes by diversity-crazed administrators, who nationwide spend billions of dollars on diversity and a multiculturalist agenda. Racial discord and other kinds of strife are their meal tickets.

Black people, as well as homosexuals, should condemn these hoaxes, but so far, most have remained silent. If police are right that Smollett’s claims were a dastardly hoax, it will cause doubt to be cast on future real claims of assault based on race and sexual orientation. It also will have a negative impact on race relations. This is not something to be taken lightly. If Smollett is found guilty of a felony as he is charged, he should suffer heavy penalties, including jail time. There’s a lesson to be learned from one of Aesop’s fables, “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.”

Jussie Smollett claims he was the victim a racist and homophobic attack by two men, but he's been charged with filing a false report after doubts were raised about his story.

Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn't credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. Last week, Guglielmi said media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives.

But on Saturday, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" Kavanagh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Also Tuesday, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said that she is recusing herself from the current investigation in Chicago.

""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" Foxx's spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."""

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett is now being considered a suspect for filing a false report to police, several weeks after he claimed he had been attacked and beaten by two masked men in a racially motivated attack.

“Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigaton by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony,” Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department said on Twitter. “Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

Smollett had told police he had been attacked by two masked men while leaving a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. on January 29. He claimed the men shouted racial and homophobic insults, beat him up and tied a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene.

Initially, Guglielmi had told The New York Post police had “no reason to doubt” Smollett’s story but investigators were unable to find any surveillance video of the attack.

On Friday, police detained two men who they believed may have been suspects in the alleged attack but they were later released after Guglielmi said the investigation had “shifted,” the Associated Press reports. The men were identified as brothers Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo.

Smollett’s attorneys reportedly met with prosecutors Wednesday, but it’s not known what was discussed during that meeting or whether Smollett was in attendance.

On Saturday, his attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson released a statement claiming that reports that he had falsified the attack were inaccurate.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement said, according to the AP."

During the MSNBC program AM Joy this past Sunday, host Joy Reid asked Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris if, during her campaign, it would “be difficult … to advocate race-based policy” without becoming vulnerable to the charge that she was engaging in identity politics. In her response, Harris said:

“I want to talk about the issue of identity politics, Joy. This term identity politics, people will use that term — it’s like people used to talk about the race card. They bring this term up when you talk about issues that are about race, about sexual orientation, about religion. They’ll bring it up when we are talking about civil rights issues as a way to marginalize the issue, as a way to frankly try to silence you or shut you up. We need to call it what it is, which is to try and divert away from a conversation that needs to happen in America. Why? One, because we must speak truth. Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism are all real in this country, so we need to have that conversation and address it. Two, and this is equally important, how America deals with the issues and the disparities, and also the hate that can be — that causes these issues to become lethal in proportion — how America deals with these issues is a matter of American identity. This is not about identity politics, and if it is, it’s about the identity of the United States of America. How we handle the issues will be about our collective identity.”

If we distill Harris's meandering reply down to its essence, she is saying that there is nothing whatsoever wrong with identity politics, because identity politics is ultimately a vehicle for helping more Americans understand that the very “identity of the United States of America” has always been — and continues to be — thoroughly infested with the ineradicable sins of “racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, [and] anti-Semitism.”



Harris recently touched on this same theme at a campaign stop in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she voiced her support for doing away with the Columbus Day holiday and replacing it with “Indigenous People’s Day.” In other words, identity politics is perfectly appropriate in this case because, as Harris puts it, America represents “the scene of a crime when it comes to what we did with slavery and Jim Crow and institutionalized racism in this country, and we have to be honest about that.” Thus, Harris argues that drawing distinctions between different groups of people is not only desirable but necessary, since that is the only method by which we can properly identify our population's victimizers and victims, guilty and innocent, evil and good.



Wherever this identity-politics mindset has been used as the raw material of public policy, never once has it led to increased harmony between separate demographic groups. Without exception, it has increased intergroup hostility and violence. This has proven true not only in the United States, but also in nations as varied and far-flung as India, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and Malaysia, where preferential policies that were designed to somehow right historic wrongs, instead unleashed torrents of rage that in some cases brought colossal levels of violence and bloodshed to places that previously had been relatively tranquil. Hoover Institution scholar Thomas Sowell has very clearly and concisely laid out the facts regarding this international phenomenon.



But such realities could never persuade egomaniacal, power-obsessed demagogues like Kamala Harris to reconsider their approach. Such individuals care only about implementing their political agendas, even if truths like those laid bare by Dr. Sowell must be swept under the carpet. That is why Harris so eagerly and reflexively jumped aboard the identity-politics bandwagon in response to the recent race hoax perpetrated by the black, openly gay actor Jussie Smollett.



On January 29, the senator reacted with instant, horrified outrage when media outlets first reported that Smollett was claiming that he had just been victimized by a hate crime perpetrated by two white men who had assaulted him, poured bleach on him, draped a rope around his neck, and shouted “This is MAGA country,” along with a variety of anti-black and anti-gay slurs. Unable to wait even a few moments for additional facts to unfold regarding this beautifully scripted gift from the gods of identity politics, Harris rushed to her computer keyboard and tweeted: “This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”



A couple of weeks later, Harris and fellow senators Cory Booker and Tim Scott asked for unanimous consent on the Senate floor to pass the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act, legislation aimed at formally criminalizing the act of lynching for the first time in U.S. history. After all, the white attackers had put a rope around poor Jussie's neck, right? The motion was passed.



Then, when it subsequently became obvious that Smollett's tale was a complete fabrication that he himself had orchestrated, a reporter asked Senator Harris to comment on the matter. Suddenly she was interested in waiting for more information: “I think the facts are still unfolding and … I think that once the investigation has concluded, then we can all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.”



In other words, by now Harris knew that the whole story was a toxic brew of lies, so she needed to back slowly and inconspicuously away from the absurd remarks she had made earlier. And then, when Smollett was finally charged with a felony for having filed a false police report, Harris tweeted that she was “sad, frustrated and disappointed.” But she felt that way only because the actor's false report “diverts resources away from serious investigations” of similar crimes that supposedly are commonplace, while making it “more difficult for other victims … to come forward.”



As Harris expanded on those remarks, she made it clear that, in her view, the main lesson of the Smollett incident was that no one should “dismiss and downplay” the fact that “hate crimes” of that type “are on the rise in America.” Yet she made no mention of the fact that the incidence of black-on-white violence in the U.S. has dwarfed the incidence of white-on-black violence for as long as criminal-victimization statistics have been kept. Facts like that don't matter at all to identity-politics charlatans like Kamala Harris. That is why, even after having made a contemptuous fool of herself with her breathless condemnations of “a modern-day lynching,” she still managed to regain her footing upon the pedestal of moral preeners, as she announced heroically: “I will always condemn racism and homophobia. We must always confront hate directly, and we must always seek justice. That is what I will keep fighting for.”"

So I guess the same mainstream media that lionized hoaxer Jussie Smollett for three weeks must now be swarming real victim Bryton Turner of Mashpee.

Right, right?

Surely the 23-year-old American will be on GMA with Robin Roberts this morning, and she’ll be gurgling “Beautiful” like she did with Jussie. Brooke Baldwin of CNN will be sadly clucking, “This is America 2019. …” Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris must surely be comparing the attack at the Mexican restaurant in Falmouth to a “modern-day lynching.”

I texted Turner last night and asked him if he was being deluged with requests from the alt-left media to share his story of oppression and hatred and bigotry run amok. Networks? Cable?

“The major ones haven’t reached out,” he texted back. “I think just Fox & Friends.”

Oddly, this Trump supporter hasn’t set up a GoFundMe page. Last night, he was studying for the Rhode Island hoisting exam — in other words, he’s a deplorable. He works for a living. He has calluses on his hands.

Shall we count the multiple ways he must have triggered the illegal immigrant from Brazil who allegedly assaulted him? Then asked the bartender to “poison the kid’s drink.”

Think of all the airtime and ink that fake hate crimes have eaten up recently. The Covington Catholic teens, the transgender man in Jackson, Mich., just arrested for torching his own house and killing five of his pets … .

And this is just in the last few weeks.

Here we have a real, documented hate crime in Falmouth, with a real victim and a real perp, and the national media doesn’t care. Or are they concentrating on this week’s other MAGA-hat hate crime — the 81-year-old man in New Jersey who was assaulted Monday over his MAGA hat? Or the assault on the conservative on the UC Berkeley campus?

Crickets, please.

The Brazilian illegal immigrant is Rosiane Santos, and on the night she was arrested, she admitted to Ch. 25, “I had a little bit to drink. Maybe that’s the reason that I couldn’t walk away, but being discriminated for so many times in my life, I just had to stand up for my life.”

Turner said he joined some friends for dinner at the Casa Vallarta Mexican restaurant in Falmouth. He and his friends were sitting at the bar, as was the illegal immigrant.

“She started saying, ‘What does your hat say? What does your hat say?’ I told her and she said, ‘Why would you wear that hat here?’

“I said, ‘It’s America. I can wear this hat wherever I want.’”

As Turner and his friends ate, the woman continued to berate him, and finally, he said, she went over and pushed his hat off.

“She started to throw a fit and cause a scene. She threw my hat across the bar three or four times before I took the video with my cellphone. I tried to take the video just so she would stop but she didn’t.”

The bartender called 911 and when the cops arrived, he showed them the video. They were escorting the woman out of the bar when she again lunged at the American taxpayer, hitting him.

When they arrived at the police station, the illegal immigrant refused to get out of the cruiser and yelled, “What are you going to do if I don’t?” What they did was call ICE.

Last week, I asked Turner if he felt he was the victim of a hate crime.

“I would like to say no, but honestly, I was minding my own business and she threw a fit over my beliefs, so I guess by definition, yeah, I am.

“We can’t let these people scare us. We can’t let these people win when they assault people who don’t agree with them. … She’s obviously not very intelligent. She just sees a red hat and gets mad ‘cause it represents America, I guess.”

ICE’s arrest was the second one in Massachusetts this week involving an illegal immigrant charged with a headline-generating crime.

On Monday, ICE detained an illegal immigrant from Guatemala, Victor Bamaca-Perez, who had been arrested by Lynn police after crashing his car into a light pole, with his 7-year-old daughter in the backseat. Police found 18 empty beer cans in the car, and a full one in his sweatshirt.

The illegal immigrant was charged with operating under the influence, driving without a license and child endangerment. The prosecutor asked that he be held without bail, but the judge, a Mitt Romney appointee named Matthew Nestor, set bail at $5,000.

Like the illegal Brazilian, the Guatemalan is now in ICE custody pending deportation proceedings.

Not only is he knowledgeable of government processes and the inner workings of the Justice Department, but he’s also an articulate and effective defender of due process and equal treatment under the law.

With that in mind, what he said this week during an appearance on Fox News host Laura Ingraham’s podcast should jolt Americans to their core and make all of us — regardless of political party affiliation — take stock of just how badly our institutions have been corrupted to the point where none of us is safe.

The two were discussing how the Left-wing media and Democrats have mastered the “art of deflection” — that is, the ability to refocus the country’s attention away from an issue that is harmful to them politically and on o one that is advantageous to them.

One of the most recent examples is the mainstream media (MSM) ignoring a story involving Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, who was exposed recently for posting a photo in his medical school yearbook featuring one person in blackface and another wearing a KKK hood and robe (Northam has not said which one was him and in fact has denied that either of the people in the photo was of him — and the media isn’t asking).

Sponsored solution from the Health Ranger Store: Lab-verified Nascent Iodine solution is a dietary supplement that provides your body with supplemental iodine to help protect your thyroid during radiation exposure. Nuclear accidents such as Fukushima (or nuclear war) can expose your body to radioactive iodine-131, a dangerous radioisotope. Pre-loading your system with stable iodine occupies the iodine receptor sites on your organs, causing your body to naturally expel radioactive iodine you may have been exposed to through air, food, water or milk products. This defensive strategy is recommended by nearly all health authorities, worldwide, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Discover more at this link.

Meanwhile, another Virginia Democratic leader, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who is black, was credibly accused by two women of sexual harassment. When female accusers were pointing their fingers at now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the MSM was wall-to-wall with the story, the accusations, and the condemnation (sans proof).

After perfunctory outrage by some in the media and the Democratic Party, both stories have now essentially died. All Northam had to do was “wait it out,” Ingraham said, long enough for the MSM to move on to something else that is less damaging to their preferred political party. (Related: Fake HATE goes hand in hand with fake NEWS, and it’s all enforced by the censorship of the tech giants.)

The media are driving our division and hate

The ‘deflection’ came when “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett’s story broke. The MSM and Democrats quickly leaped on Smollett’s bandwagon, claiming that real racism and hate exists among POTUS Donald Trump supporters; never mind that within days Smollett’s story fell apart and he’s now been accused by Chicago PD of staging a hate crime hoax.

When Smollett’s story turned out to be a nothing burger, the MSM deflected again, picking up on another aspect of “Trump/Republican hate” — a radicalized Coast Guard officer who bought a bunch of guns and ammo and devised a “target list” of Democrats and Leftist media types.

But always Democrats and their MSM lackeys are hating on Republicans, and especially POTUS Trump, is the point; the media never focus for very long when Democrats are exposed as the anti-American haters they are.

“There’s two standards of justice, one for Democrats one for Republicans,” the outspoken diGenova told Ingraham.

Then he added, shockingly:

The press is all Democrat, all liberal, all progressive, all Left – they hate Republicans, they hate Trump. So the suggestion that there’s ever going to be civil discourse in this country for the foreseeable future in this country is over. It’s not going to be. It’s going to be total war. And as I say to my friends, I do two things – I vote and I buy guns.

Translation: The media is feeding our national discourse and division and will be the primary catalyst for our next civil war.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett “still has the presumption of innocence and he still has his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route.”

But as he noted on “Good Morning America” on Monday, “there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that doesn’t support the version that he gave us,” Johnson told host Robin Roberts. “There’s still a lot of video evidence, physical evidence and testimony that doesn’t support what he said happened.”

After a thorough investigation, that is currently ongoing, Johnson says detectives considered Smollett a victim up until they detained and questions the two Nigerian-American brothers who are allegedly connection to the case.

“I refused to characterize Jussie Smollett as a suspect unless we had concrete evidence,” Johnson said. “The 47th hour that we had those two individuals in custody is when it changed.”

He added, “We worked very closely with their lawyer, and (she) went in there to talk to them, and whatever she said to them apparently got through to them – to just tell the truth about what happened,” Johnson said. “And that’s what they decided to do.”

Johnson’s interview with Roberts comes a week after Jussie sat down with her and gave his version of what went down on the night of his alleged attack.

“The entire time that we investigated the incident he was treated like a victim,” Johnson told Roberts on Monday morning. But the admits that the evidence soon became overwhelming. When Smollett allegedly filed a false report is when Johnson decided to publicly refute his story.

On Thursday, Chicago police held a press conference in which they alleged Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to stage a “bogus” attack against him as part of an elaborate PR stunt because he was dissatisfied with his “Empire.” salary.

Johnson’s GMA interview came days after “Empire” executive producers announced that Jussie’s character will be removed from the final two episodes of season 5.

Smollett was arrested last Thursday morning after turning himself in to police. He was released after posting $10,000 bond and ordered to surrender his passport. His next hearing is scheduled for March 14."

Smollett, a gay black actor who starred on the show “Empire,” claimed he was assaulted by two men who insulted him with racial and homophobic slurs before putting a noose around his neck. Police found no evidence of the attack, and last week charged Smollett with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

“Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that does not support the version he gave,” said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson during an interview on “Good Morning America.”

“There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply doesn’t support his version of what happened,” Johnson said.

Johnson added that throughout the investigation, police gave Smollett victim status.

“I refused to let CPD characterize him as a suspect unless we had concrete evidence,” Johnson said. “The entire time that we investigated the incident he was treated like a victim.”

The course of the investigation changed when police questioned Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were in the 47th hour of the 48 hours they could be held when they admitted they were paid to stage the attack.

“We worked very closely with their lawyer, and (she) went in there to talk to them, and whatever she said to them apparently got through to them – to just tell the truth about what happened,” Johnson said. “And that’s what they decided to do.”

“We didn’t have the facts to support him being involved in it until that 47th hour, and it’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago police saying he did something, it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this,” Johnson said.

The brothers “said that he paid them $3,500 with a check . . . to carry out this incident,” Johnson said. He revealed last week that Smollett staged the attack to boost his status and salary on the show.

Johnson said once the facts were clear, he had to follow the truth.

“The city of Chicago has its issues, the Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that, and I’m acutely aware of that. But we didn’t earn this particular incident and I just refuse to let us have to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary. So I just want people to understand that it’s a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department, so it’s my responsibility to ensure that the record gets set straight,” he said.

Smollett has maintained his innocence and his attorneys released a statement saying he “feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

When police charged Smollett with staging the attack, Johnson was visibly angry over the ordeal that Chicago had been put through after it received national condemnation from commentators who believed Smollett’s account of the Jan. 29 incident.

“It’s just despicable,” he said then, according to the Chicago Tribune.

“It makes you wonder what’s going on in someone’s mind to be able to do something like that. … I’m left hanging my head and asking why?” Johnson said. “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

Mary Ann Lisanti, 51, apologized to the Maryland House Democratic Caucus on Tuesday, one day after she apologized to the leaders of the state's Legislative Black Caucus. In a message to her constituents in Harford County northeast of Baltimore, Lisanti said she was ""ashamed"" and ""sickened"" she had used the word, which ""does not represent my belief system, my life’s work or what’s in my heart.""

It is my hope and prayer that you ... can forgive me for the pain that I have caused, and help me to mend what I have broken,"" she added. ""I will continue work every day to repent for my actions and represent my constituents.""

The Post reported on Monday that Lisanti told a white colleague that he had been campaigning in a ""[N-word] district"" in mostly black Prince George's County to support a candidate in last fall's elections. Asked about it by the newspaper earlier this month, The Post reported that Lisanti said, ""I don't recall that. ... I don't recall much of that evening.""

When asked by The Post whether she had ever used the slur, the newspaper reported that she said: ""I'm sure I have. ... I'm sure everyone has used it.""

Del. Darryl Barnes, the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland chairman, described Lisanti's apology as ""woefully inadequate"" and urged House Speaker Michael Busch to discipline the delegate. Busch, also a Democrat, announced Lisanti would no longer chair the Unemployment Insurance Subcommittee of the House Economic Matters Committee, because ""I believe that leaders in the House need to be able to bring people together -- not tear them apart.""

Busch also said that Lisanti had agreed to sensitivity training.

""I hope that through sensitivity training that Delegate Lisanti has agreed to and the help of her colleagues, she will develop a greater understanding of the impact that she has had on her fellow legislators and the entire House of Delegates,"" Busch said in a statement.

Barnes, who represents part of Prince George's County, noted in his letter to Busch that African-Americans make up nearly 30 percent of Maryland's population. He also pointed out that the Maryland General Assembly has 57 black members out of 188 legislators.

""It is clear that Delegate Lisanti is unsuited to continue in a position of leadership in the Maryland General Assembly,"" Barnes said in the letter. ""We have been receiving calls for her resignation, removal of subcommittee chairmanship, and to be censured on the House floor.""

The rise of social media characters dedicated to plying the malleable fringe of the electorate with dubious claims and disinformation has paced the onus on the news media and reputable sources to combat their efforts.

The left needs to take accountability, too

By CJ Pearson

We live in a time in which there is a war on truth. We live in a time in which the ""truth"" most comforting is the truth most acceptable. We live in a time in which the truth — most unfortunately — is discardable.

In January, the students of Covington Catholic High School traveled to our nation's capital unknowing of the debacle that would follow. In short order, their lives would be upended by a social media mob with no regard or concern for the truth.

Innocent teenage boys — whom I have since come to know quite well — would soon be labeled racists and bigots. They would be accused of disrespect and incivility. They would face death threats and doxxing. All due to one video clip, taken severely out of context, which took the internet by storm.

I watched firsthand as my friends at Covington Catholic were crucified and marred by nameless online trolls whom they had never met. I watched firsthand as my friends at Covington had death wished upon them. I looked on as grown men and women — with little to any evidence — denigrated, defamed and slandered children. And I looked on as new evidence came to light that exonerated my friends but was ignored by some of the same left-wing actors that had sought to ruin their lives.

Evidence was ignored for one reason: to keep alive the baseless and salacious narrative that had been perpetuated. The narrative that all supporters of President Donald Trump — young and old — are racist and bigoted.

This is not the only instance in which those on the left have disregarded the truth in an effort to proliferate a lie.

Last week, actor Jussie Smollett was charged with doing just that: filing a false police report in connection to a hate crime that allegedly never even happened. Smollett alleged that while walking the streets of Chicago, he was attacked by two white men wearing Make America Great Again hats. He also claimed to have been verbally accosted with a barrage of homophobic and racial slurs. And that he was left bruised and badly beaten on a sidewalk near a Subway restaurant.

However, this is now in question. According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett staged this attack, paying two actors $3,500 to carry it out. He allegedly did so because he was dissatisfied with his salary of as much as $125,000 per episode.

If he concocted this hoax, Smollett has defamed Trump's millions of supporters and did so unashamedly. If this is a hoax, Smollett did nothing more than confirm the prejudices held by those on the left toward those on the right.

Apparently, he not only sought to plant seeds of division, he also sought to profit from them — truth be damned.

What others are saying

Gordon Pennycook and David Rand, The New York Times: ""Reasoning can exacerbate the problem, not provide the solution, when it comes to partisan disputes over facts. Further evidence cited in support of this of argument comes from a 2010 study by the political scientists Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler, who found that appending corrections to misleading claims in news articles can sometimes backfire: Not only did corrections fail to reduce misperceptions, but they also sometimes increased them. It seemed as if people who were ideologically inclined to believe a given falsehood worked so hard to come up with reasons that the correction was wrong that they came to believe the falsehood even more strongly.""

Brett Bruen, CNN.com: ""In many ways, information warfare is harder to detect than nuclear, chemical, or biological agents. Like a mythical creature, it is able to constantly change forms. Not having a group standing watch together creates gaps, delays and difficulty in developing a high-performing team. ... Facebook, Twitter, Google and the rest need to start working together to tackle this threat. I have yet to see them take steps to break down communications, coordination and collaboration barriers between the companies. Instead, they remain stuck in a competitive race where consumers continue to come a distant second.""

Matthijs Tieleman, The Washington Post: ""As in the 18th century, there are invisible forces that try to incite our passions, whether that is for geopolitical gain, ad income or even something as innocent as seeking our votes. If we want to keep the free society most of us cherish, it is our responsibility to be reasonable and not rush to judgment, to consume news from multiple perspectives and be open to changing our minds every now and then.""

Smollett had been in the news since alleging in late January that he was attacked by two men who hit him in the face and tied a rope around his neck while yelling racist and anti-gay slurs.

In the same Facebook post, the Madea creator also brought attention to a missing persons case involving two Florida men, Felipe Santos and Terrance Williams, who went missing in October 2003 and January 2004. They were both allegedly last seen by former Collier County deputy sheriff Steve Calkins and in 2018, civil rights attorney Ben Crump filed a wrongful death lawsuit against him.

“I wish that half the attention that Justice Smollett thing got could have been paid to this,” Perry reiterated on the latest episode of BuzzFeed News’ Profile. “Because it's such an unfair story. It's a modern-day murder, lynching, or whatever he did to them, and they've disappeared and nobody seems to care.”

Perry said he helped Santos’ mother pay for the lawsuit “in hopes that we get information that will lead to a criminal complaint.”

“This man has never faced justice,” Perry said."

America is the crown jewel of the Free World. America's president is the leader of the Free World. Thank God America is the powerful mainspring of the Free World! Let's now eavesdrop on what the media of the Free World were churning out, and what the people of the Free World were absorbed with, over the last weekend of February 2019.

A black homosexual actor was accused of hiring two Nigerian brothers to fake an attack on him, beating him up (but not too badly), putting a noose around his neck like the Southern lynch mobs used to do and making the alleged assault appear to be the work of white racist, homophobic Trump supporters.

Then, too, there was much fuss about the lieutenant governor of Virginia reportedly ""grabbing women by the head and forcing them to give him oral sex"" and the billionaire owner of America's best football team allegedly getting his fill of thrills with hookers in a human-trafficking operation run out of a Florida strip mall massage parlor.

What, now, is that other story some of the newscasts mentioned at the end? Oh, yes. There was something about a dictator in Venezuela who was still managing to cling to power despite growing opposition and escalating violence! And starvation!

I feel like grabbing the Free World by the collar and shaking it and saying, ""See here, Mr. and Mrs. Free World! At this rate you won't enjoy freedom much longer! You won't even have the upholstery of freedom if you don't free up Venezuela here and now!""

This confrontation has everything. All the bad guys are early on deck and ready for active duty. Cuba has long been in charge of Venezuela's enslavement, under the tutelage of Moscow's trusty KGB. The Venezuelan dictator pays for this so-far stable repression with oil, of which Venezuela has, beneath its surface, the planet's largest known deposits.

Russia, China and Iran are right there where Dictator Maduro needs them to humiliate America by scaring away any serious threat to his despotic regime.

Now it's coming apart. Every day more and more anti-Maduro demonstrations erupt, and Maduro is in the strange position of using force to prevent humanitarian aid shipments from getting through. More and more of Maduro's soldiers are defecting, deserting and refusing orders to fire upon their own starving people.

So, the bad guys are ready to slaughter Venezuela's freedom-lovers (and, as this is being written, are actually doing so). President Trump vows support of the president of Venezuela's National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, and talks of non-violence but then quickly adds that everything is on the table!

There used to be an ""Organization of American States"" to deal with Western Hemisphere issues. Are they still around? I never could figure out what they did, but they sure enjoyed their work.

Suggestion from the floor: Let Trump go on TV and announce that the overturned trucks and other roadblocks preventing food shipments from reaching the people of Venezuela must be removed by 2 p.m. tomorrow, or the United States armed forces will remove them and will televise that operation in real time, and will not be the first to shoot.

In case the action turns dull, I suggest the U.S. forces back up the video with a rousing rendition of ""When the Saints Go Marching In""!

P.S. If Jussie Smollett is brought to trial (as he should be) for perpetrating his repulsive hoax, one wonders if the prosecutors will write him a ""Thank You"" note for having paid his hired thugs with a personal check (and one wonders if their private nickname for him is ""Einstein"")! I'm reminded of how columnist Pete Hamill used to punctuate revelations as breathtaking as this one with just one word: ""Beautiful!"""

When his story first surfaced, liberal politicians, celebrities and news commentators gushed with boundless compassion for Smollett and sneered with contempt for his presumed white attackers. “This is America in 2019,” one commentator lamented, her voice dripping with disgust. Yet all the while, they suppressed an almost palpable glee — the exuberance that comes with vindication. They believed Smollett had given them irrefutable proof that America had become a racist country under Donald Trump’s presidency.

Then, in an instant, it was gone. They were left stunned and dumbfounded, duped by a charlatan from their own ranks. After learning the whole thing was a hoax, a few did some perfunctory soul-searching. Some announced they would wait — belatedly — for all the facts. A few even continued supporting Smollett. Evoking memories of O.J. Simpson, they theorized that “racist” police were trying to railroad an innocent black man.

But Democrats don’t need Smollett to denounce Trump as racist and the cause of today’s racial divide.

Yes, the divide is real. One Gallup Poll indicates that 42 percent of Americans were worried about race relations in 2017 vs. just 17 percent in 2014.

But the problem began long before Trump was elected.

TRENDING: Chicago Mayor Calls 'Scooby-Doo' Parody Criticizing Her 'Racist,' Then the Artist Fires Back

A chart prepared by the same polling company depicts the perception of race relations in America between 2001 and 2016. It shows that between 2001 and 2012, most Americans, black and white, consistently saw race relations as “very good” or “somewhat good.” It was in 2013, mid-way through Barack Obama’s presidency, that attitudes on race relations took a dramatic turn south.

With the election of America’s first black president, Democrats discovered just how versatile a weapon the race card could be. They used it mercilessly, relentlessly to attack Obama’s critics. Anyone who raised questions about his birth certificate or his unexplained social security number was labeled racist. Those who were suspicious of his Muslim background or his long-time association with America-hating Jeremiah Wright, they, too, were called racist. Those who dared challenge his unilateral DACA decree and liberal border policies were attacked as racist. Even the political opponents who challenged his socialist doctrine of wealth redistribution were branded as racist.

Obama’s election launched a national obsession with racism, and he did nothing to quell it.

As a presidential candidate, Obama pontificated about racial unity with inspirational words like these: “There is not a Black America and a White America … there’s the United States of America.” As president, his rhetoric changed. In 2016, at a memorial service for slain police officers in Dallas, he was somehow compelled to talk about the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow, adding, “If we’re honest perhaps we’ve heard prejudice in our own heads and felt it in our own hearts … No institution is entirely immune. And that includes our police departments.”

During his presidency, the fanatical anti-police organization, “Black Lives Matter,” was born, and Obama wasted no time embracing it. During lighter times, he related personal anecdotes, like the time, as a young professional, he was allegedly mistaken for a valet while waiting for his car.

Perhaps, in his mind, Obama was only highlighting the remnants of Jim Crow, but who can doubt that those subtle references and innuendoes contributed to the widening racial divide? In fact, Obama started with a country that was reasonably content with race relations and left a country that felt angry, shamed and deeply divided.

Donald Trump was elected with his promise to reverse the policies implemented by Obama, especially those related to border security. For that, Democrats wasted no time branding him and his supporters as racist.

Today, they are more obsessed than ever with racism. They try to eradicate America’s past by tearing down historic monuments. In schools, venues are established where no white students are welcome, and they’re learning concepts once inconceivable to Americans — white guilt and white privilege. And while teachers and professors are convincing students to accept responsibility for something they never did, Democratic presidential candidates are talking about reparations for something that happened 150 years ago.

RELATED: How Does America Have So Much Racism with So Few Racists?

Dr. Martin Luther King understood the evils of racism, but he focused on the future. He had a dream. He saw a future, where skin color played no role in one’s destiny, where his children would not be “judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” That dream of a color-blind nation will never be realized as long as Democrats continue to obsess about our racist past. And it certainly won’t ever happen as long as they perpetuate racial division with baseless allegations of bigotry.

They didn’t find what they wanted in the Smollett case, but they’ll keep looking. They’ll root around through prison statistics. They’ll scrutinize police methods. They’ll scrounge through decades-old high-school photos, and they’ll remain ever vigilant for those inappropriate jokes or careless words they can use to show America’s bigotry.

But these champions of racial justice somehow overlook the impact their false and inflammatory accusations have made over the years. As they tiptoe away from Jussie Smollett and the damage he’s done to race relations, they might reflect on their own contributions to the racial divide.

The media, in keeping par for the course, bought Smollett’s fantastical story hook, line and sinker.

The day the news broke, The Washington Post ran an analysis headlined, “The Jussie Smollett attack highlights the hate black gay Americans face.” CNN political analyst, April Ryan, tweeted, “This attack on @JussieSmollett is a hate crime and should be treated as such!” Ernest Owens, a writer at Philadelphia Magazine, tweeted, “Trump MAGA supporters came after a Black gay man with a noose in Chicago. They yelled ‘This is MAGA country.’ And that’s how far we haven’t come in 2019. Hoping for justice & vengeance for @JussieSmollett.”

Why give Smollett such immediate and uncritical coverage? Because that’s the story the media are fishing for. Smollett was spinning the yarn that forms the narrative that President Donald Trump and his legion of supporters have ushered in an era of rising hate crimes against blacks, gays, Native Americans, Muslims and any other media-celebrated “community.” Yet, none of this is true. And, as Smollett was surrendering himself to the Chicago police department, the media, which should have been spending its time wiping the egg off its face, wondered why he did it. The credulous Ana Cabrera of CNN asked, “The big question, then, is why? Why he would make something like this up?”

What? Is she kidding? Smollett made it up because he knew the media would lap it up, and in the process, transform him from a largely unknown television actor into a major cause celebrity; and that means more money and fame for Smollett. Smollett is black and gay and, according to him, someone who “comes hard at 45.” For the media, Smollett was right out of central casting. So, when he cried wolf, the media became his chorus. And on cue, the rest of the left joined in.

Democratic presidential contenders and black and gay rights groups poured-out their support for Smollett and ramped up their denunciation of Trump. GLAAD stated, “Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.” The NAACP declared, “The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric.” Democratic New York Sen. Kristen Gillibrand tweeted, “…it’s the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color. We are all responsible for condemning this behavior and every person who enables or normalizes it.”

TRENDING: Chicago Mayor Calls 'Scooby-Doo' Parody Criticizing Her 'Racist,' Then the Artist Fires Back

By lavishing coverage on this preposterous story, the media gave Smollett the best, albeit brief, role of his career. He was finally a leading man. Smollett found himself featured on ABC news in a special segment hosted by anchor Robin Roberts, herself a black and gay rights activist.

Instead of Roberts doing a story on any of the 20 homicides that occurred in Chicago in January 2019 or one about the first shooting victim being a 12-year-old black boy, Javota Schaefer, Roberts gave Smollett center stage and allowed him to regale America about the racism and homophobia of “MAGA country.”

Roberts, now confronted with the truth that she had been played by a fellow activist, claims of the hoax, “It’s a setback for race relations, homophobia, MAGA supporters — the fingers were pointed at them. I cannot think of another case where there’s this anger on so many sides, and you can understand why there would be.” Anger on so many sides? It was Trump and Trump supporters who were the ones defamed by Smollett; and the media and the left enabled it just like they enabled the defamation of the Covington Catholic High School boys by another left-wing activist, Nathan Phillips.

Joy Behar of ABC’s “The View,” in a rare moment of candor, answered Whoopi Goldberg’s question about the media response to the Covington Catholic hoax, “Why do we keep making the same mistake?” by saying, “We’re desperate to get Trump out of office.” In their desperation to remove Trump, the media are giving ample and laudatory coverage to one anti-Trump hate-crime hoax after another. By doing this and by labeling half of America as racists and bigots the media are doing much to stoke racial strife.

The truth is that racism and anti-gay bigotry have greatly subsided in America. We’ve come a long way from Selma and Stonewall. The way forward is to stop finding racism and bigotry where it doesn’t exist and stop blaming it on the blameless. But so long as the term “racist” continues to be the most powerful word in the English language, and so long as the media and the left continue to retain exclusive ownership and control over that word, they’ll continue to use it to cudgel conservatives and Trump supporters into political submission.

At least with Trump, and that young Nick Sandmann, we have a couple of Americans ready, willing and able to fight back.

Love, the woman who bailed R.Kelly out of jail, is speaking out, according to The Herald-News.

Love, 47, of Romeoville, Ill., on Monday posted $100,000 to bail the singer out of the Cook County jail where he was awaiting trial on charges he sexually abused four people dating back to 1998, including three underage girls, the report said.

“If your friend was in trouble, wouldn’t you bail them out?” she said, according to the news outlet. Love claimed in court documents that she and Kelly are childhood friends.

During an interview with Fox News‘ Tia Ewing, Love denied all claims that Kelly was broke, and stood firmly behind her friend’s innocence. In a transcribed statement to Ewing, Kelly’s friend stated:

“I’m not going to say it was my money (Valencia P. Love) or his (RKelly) money and he’s not broke. He was going to post bond by Thursday anyway. He’s my friend and I knew he need help. There are three sides to every story, his side, there’s (the alleged victims) and the truth. I can’t say [the victims] are lying. It wasn’t my money, I’m not going to say whose money it is. I don’t condone any man sodomizing anyone or abusing a woman. He (Rkelly) told me he was innocent, if he did it he is wrong.”

Love, a former daycare worker and current owner of the Windy City restaurant, Love on The Blu, went on to parallel the singer’s story to that of the ongoing controversy surrounding Catholic priests, claiming that R.Kelly is “Not a monster,” the News-Herald wrote.

Clara Chan', 'Trey Williams']",https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-963162926-1.jpg,"['state', 'law', 'smollett', 'wont', 'charged', 'felony', 'public', 'prison', 'federal', 'probably', 'weisberg', 'jussie']","Jussie Smollett is unlikely to serve time if he’s convicted of filing a false police report, which he was charged with last week, Chicago-based defense attorneys and other legal experts told TheWrap.

“Empire” star Smollett is charged with a Class 4 felony count of disorderly conduct/filing a false police report. A Class 4 is the lowest kind of felony, and in Illinois carries a maximum of 1 to 3 years in prison. It could also result in a fine of up to $25,000.

“Almost nobody would go to prison on a class 4,” Andrew Weisberg, a former prosecutor in the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office who now works as a defense attorney, told TheWrap. “I would be surprised if he got [prison] time.”

Weisberg said Smollett is more likely to get probation and be forced to pay restitution to the Chicago police department for time and resources wasted on an investigation. He could also be required to submit to a psychological evaluation and comply with any counseling recommendation, Weisberg added.

Another Chicago defense attorney agreed Smollett was unlikely to spend time behind bars.

“My guess is that he would likely get probation if convicted,” said James E. Fabbrini, of Fabbrini Law Group.

Smollett surrendered to Chicago police early Thursday morning, hours after he was formally charged. He posted bail and surrendered his passport following a bond hearing in front of State of Illinois Circuit Court of Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lykew, and was released Thursday afternoon.

Smollett had to post $10,000, 10 percent of his $100,000 bail. His next court date is Thursday, March 14 at 11:30 a.m.

Laurie L. Levenson, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School, said that the bail amount was high for a Class 4 felony, but she believes that Smollett was seen as a flight risk because of several factors: He’s accused of staging his own attack, he’s a public figure, and he hasn’t admitted any wrongdoing.

“You don’t typically see bails that high for somebody charged [with] that level of offense,” she said. “He has all of the risk factors that the court would look at.”

The public nature of this case — which was decried by Chicago Police superintendent Eddie Johnson — complicates matters for Smollett, but only in the sense that it’s unlikely he would receive a lighter-than-usual sentence.

“That usually makes it worse for the defendant, because then prosecutors know that everyone is watching,” Weisberg said. “They feel they have to be tougher on the defendant.”

At most, Weisberg speculated, Smollett could get 30 days in a county jail, plus probation, and avoid a longer prison sentence.

Levenson said that even though the case “has been sensationalized,” it’s still a low-level felony. “In the world of criminal offenses, it is not that significant,” she continued. “It’s only significant because of who did it.”

Smollett’s defense team, which includes high-profile attorney Mark Geragos, along with Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said in a statement that the actor has been mistreated.

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,” the statement said. “Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Levenson said Smollett’s lawyers should tone it down, since Smollett does not have many public supporters right now.

“They have to find something sympathetic about him to play to the court of public opinion,” she said.

A week before Smollett reported the attack, Fox received a letter threatening Smollett. During his remarks last Thursday, Johnson said Smollett sent the letter to Fox himself, though he did not provide evidence. Later that same day, Cook County Assistant State’s Attorney Risa Lanier said that the FBI was conducting forensic analysis on the letter, and that the investigation is still ongoing.

Both the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Northern District of Illinois office declined to comment on the status of the investigation, and whether Smollett would face any further charges. It’s possible he could be charged for mail fraud, a felony which carries up to a five-year prison sentence and a maximum fine of $250,000.

But it’s more likely federal prosecutors will let the state go through with its case first, experts told TheWrap.

“It is hard to say whether the feds would actually pursue charges,” Levenson said. “Generally, they follow the petite policy and allow the state prosecutors to go first.” Petite policy refers to a housekeeping provision of the U.S. Justice Department that following a state prosecution there should be no federal prosecution for the same transaction, in the absence of compelling federal interests.

“You can always come up with federal charges, although my guess is that they would leave it to the state here,” added said USC law professor Susan Estrich."

Smollett said the assailants yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" bashed his face, crushed his ribs, splashed him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. Smollett's telling of the hate crime was gobbled up hook, line and sinker by the anti-Trump news media, but Chicago police say it was a hoax.

This type of hoax is part and parcel of the left's broad agenda of victimology, fraudulence and gimmickry, plus gross media gullibility, incompetence and political attention seeking. What's so troublesome is the fact that despite considerable evidence that the incident was a hoax, no apologies have been issued to either the public or the targets of their malfeasance – President Trump and the Americans who voted for him.

Racial hoaxes have been a major part of the leftist agenda going back decades. In 1987, the Rev. Al Sharpton created the Tawana Brawley hoax, wherein four white men were falsely accused of rape. For perpetrating the hoax, Sharpton was rewarded by receiving national recognition, millions of dollars and a career as a television/radio talk-show host, and he ran for president in 2004. He also received 82 invitations to advise Barack Obama's White House on matters of race.

Most of the nation's racial hoaxes take place on college campuses. Recall the 2006 Duke lacrosse rape case, in which three affluent white male Duke students were falsely accused of raping a black female stripper. Police exposed Bowling Green State University student Eleesha Long as a liar after she complained about being attacked by Trump supporters the day after his election. At Goucher College in Maryland, scrawlings depicted swastikas and also spelled out the N-word and the names of four black students – including the perpetrator. The Maryland police found out that the perp was a 21-year-old black lacrosse player seeking victimhood. Nonetheless, the incident led to protests, demands for designated safe spaces and demands that incoming freshmen and transfers be required to take a ""cultural competency"" course.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has compiled some of the most outrageous hate crime hoaxes since Trump was elected. The hate crime hoaxes include claims of attacks on Muslim men and women by Trump supporters. A bisexual woman falsely claimed that Trump supporters were sending her nasty notes. Most of the hate crime hoaxes have been committed by black students. Their charges include the posting of KKK signs, the sending of racist notes and the writing of racist graffiti on a black person's door with the words ""Go Home N––- Boy"" and ""Whites Only."" A black man was caught on camera spray-painting doors and vehicles with racial slurs, vulgar words and swastikas.

Even professors create hoaxes. Indiana State University professor Azhar Hussain sent bogus anti-Muslim emails to himself, according to police, ""trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself."" He was arrested for filing a false police report.

Here's the good news about the racial hoaxes on the nation's college campuses: Left-wing college students have a difficult time finding the actual racism they claim permeates college campuses. Thus, they have to invent it. Though it has not been proved yet, these students may have support for their racial hoaxes by diversity-crazed administrators, who nationwide spend billions of dollars on diversity and a multiculturalist agenda. Racial discord and other kinds of strife are their meal tickets.

Black people, as well as homosexuals, should condemn these hoaxes, but so far, most have remained silent. If police are right that Smollett's claims were a dastardly hoax, it will cause doubt to be cast on future real claims of assault based on race and sexual orientation. It also will have a negative impact on race relations. This is not something to be taken lightly. If Smollett is found guilty of a felony as he is charged, he should suffer heavy penalties, including jail time. There's a lesson to be learned from one of Aesop's fables, ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf."""
