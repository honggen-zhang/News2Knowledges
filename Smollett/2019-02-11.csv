In this episode, Red Table makes a special trip to New York for an exclusive interview with Don Lemon about the horrific hate crime against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett. Lemon reveals the obstacles he faced being a gay, black man in a high-profile job, and the challenges facing gay men in the African American community.

We thought he said some really interesting things about the Black church and the hypocrisy of our community using the same scriptures to judge gay people that were used to hold black people back."

Nearly two weeks after “Empire” star Jussie Smollett claimed he was the victim of a racist, homophobic attack, cops have yet to identify any suspects — and some people in his tony Chicago neighborhood are growing skeptical.

“I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did,” said Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same swank high-rise near the Navy Pier as Smollett.

“I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.”

Cops have said they found plenty of surveillance video, but none that captured the incident.

Meanwhile, Chicago police said Sunday that Smollett has yet to turn over data from his cellphone to verify that he was on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Moore, when he was allegedly attacked.

Moore has said he heard Smollett’s assailants shout a “racial slur” and the words “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

{snip}

“We offered to take the phone to download the data and he expressed he couldn’t be without his phone for several hours.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has said that Smollett, 36, was being treated as a crime victim, but would be held accountable if cops learn he filed a false report.

Last week, The Post traced Smollett’s likely route to the underpass from a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop where he bought a tuna sandwich and a salad.

Near the foot of a stairwell to the Loews, The Post found an empty hot sauce bottle that was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach.

The Post alerted police, who seized the bottle. Guglielmi said it was turned over to the FBI for analysis.

The FBI declined to comment."

Jussie Smollett finally provided his phone records to the Chicago Police Department on Monday morning, hours after The Post reported his delay in providing the data.

“Phone records from Jussie’s manager were sent to police on Feb. 5 and Jussie’s records were sent over this morning. Both were sent to Chief of Staff to the Superintendent of Police Robert Boik, who confirmed receipt,” a spokesperson for the “Empire” star said in an email, 13 days after Smollett alleged he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

“They have Jussie’s records from within an hour of the incident. The police confirmed receipt of the records at [2:28 p.m. EST].”

Cops requested Smollett’s phone records to corroborate a call he said he had with his manager Brandon Z. Moore during the attack.

Both men allege Smollett was called a “f—-t” and a “n—-r” during the attack and both said they heard the words “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

The police said they wanted the records so they could independently verify the two men’s accounts, which is needed for a criminal investigation, but Smollett told police he couldn’t be without his phone for several hours.

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told The Post on Sunday afternoon.

Smollett told cops he was confronted by two men on Jan. 29, one wearing a black mask, who hurled gay and racist epithets at him while he was walking home from a nearby Subway sandwich shop shortly before 2 a.m. The assailants allegedly punched Smollett in the face, doused him with a liquid — believed to be bleach — and tied a rope around his neck in an underpass between the Sheraton and Loews Chicago hotels.

Smollett’s spokesperson told The Post on Monday Smollett “is the victim here” and he has provided multiple statements to the police.

“Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” the statement read.

“Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”"

They live in the same Chicago neighborhood, and they don’t understand how what Smollett described to police could have happened to him that night.

Smollett told police he was physically attacked by men who yelled insults targeting his race and sexuality. He also said they threw a substance on him and put a rope around his neck, the Post reported. Police have yet to find any suspects or camera footage of the attack in the nearly two weeks since it allegedly took place.

A man who patronizes Lizzie McNeill’s Irish Pub, about a block away from where the attack occurred, also doubted Smollett’s story.

For those of you asking I don’t have anything new today on the Jussie Smollett case. Back at work this afternoon and will post any updates if we get them. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) February 11, 2019

“It’s a lie, because Chicago is the most liberal city around,” said the man, who spoke anonymously with the Post. “They have cameras everywhere … Why can’t they find the attack?”

Smollett told police he was on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Moore, at the time of the attack. His manager said he heard the men shouting a “racial slur” and “MAGA country.”

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, via the Post. “We offered to take the phone to download the data and he expressed he couldn’t be without his phone for several hours.”

Chicago police said Smollett still hasn’t turned over phone records so they can verify that he was indeed speaking with his manager at the time, according to the Post.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett was being treated as a crime victim, but he would face legal consequences if his story was discovered to be false, the Post reported.

My new column is about the huge divide between what Chicago police & news media are saying publicly about the Jusse Smollett allegation, & what they are saying privately. Reading the tea leaves, it’s becoming clear that Smollett lied, but will anyone care?https://t.co/1GSvU9xZYH — John Ziegler (@Zigmanfreud) February 9, 2019

According to an opinion piece in Mediaite, police and media outlets in Chicago also doubt Smollett’s story, although they have not yet officially expressed this doubt.

The article suggests that this state of hidden doubt is because the police and media are scared of a backlash of liberal outrage if they say Smollett was likely lying. That’s why they continue to follow the accepted storyline, and yet offer no new evidence of an attack. This is due to Smollett’s status as a “black, gay, liberal, celebrity, victim of a horrible hate crime,” according to the article.

The Mediaite article also states that it doesn’t matter if the police and media are correct in their asserted doubt, they will still be attacked and criticized for expressing it. The author refers to this as Smollett’s “Political Correctness Force Field.”

The article says that if one media outlet in Chicago dared to call out Smollett for the false allegations, the others would follow, but because of the risk the media are waiting for a definitive statement from Chicago police.

Tweets by Chicago ABC affiliate reporter Rob Elgas corroborate the Mediaite article. Elgas does not state his doubt in the case outright, but simply tweets out updates about having no update, and no access to information that would show evidence that something happened.

Updates tweeted by Chicago Fox affiliate reporter Rafer Weigel are equally as tepid.

“Since so many have asked me if @Chicago_Police will let #JussieSmollett case go unsolved, I’ll give my opinion. Given the high-profile nature of the crime, I don’t believe so. I believe they’ll either find the perpetrators responsible or charge #Smollett w/ filing a false report,” tweeted Weigel.

But Weigel did retweet a bold tweet from the author of the Mediaite opinion piece, John Ziegler. In the retweeted tweet Ziegler says that it’s becoming clear Smollett lied, and then wonders “will anyone care?”"

The Chicago PD has been sure to remind the 36-year old thespian of the repercussions of filing a false police report, especially one of such magnitude in such a sensitive time for society in this country.

Agin Muhammad, one of Smollett’s neighbors, claims, “I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did. I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here . . . Half the people are gay and the other half are black.”

Another anonymous individual, who says he’s a regular at a nearby bar says, “It’s a lie, because Chicago is the most liberal city around. They have cameras everywhere…Why can’t they find the attack?”

This totally contradicts the one neighbor who says that she saw a suspicious individual around the building where she and Smollett reside about 90 minutes before the alleged attack. The anonymous neighbor says she saw a man that looked like a “redneck” and “what looked like a rope, or a clothesline, protruding from the bottom of his sweatshirt, made of white and blue material.”

The police claim that Smollett has refused to give over his phone, which impedes their investigation and prompts the police to doubt Smollett’s story.

These accusations only make it harder for Smollett tot prove his case that he is indeed a victim.

Jussie Smollett has still not turned over his phone to the police in order for them to check that he was talking to his manager when he was attacked, according to police, and neighbors of the Empire star in Chicago are suspicious he was jumped the way he says he was.

Smollett, 36, was attacked at 2am on January 29 as he walked home to his apartment from a Subway in Chicago.

He told police afterwards that the assailants called him 'Empire f****t n****r' and placed a noose around his neck, shouting: 'This is MAGA country!' before dousing him in bleach.

Chicago PD has found surveillance footage of Smollett walking towards his apartment, before the attack, and afterwards but no video of the actual incident has been uncovered.

Smollett's manager, Brandon Z. Moore, came forward after the attack became public and questions arose to say that he was on the phone with the actor at the time and that he heard the attackers' remarks.

When officers asked Smollett for his phone to check that claim, he refused to hand it over.

On Monday, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told DailyMail.com investigators were yet to receive it or any phone data.

'We have yet to receive phone records from anyone,' he said.

But Smollett insisted he had given it to them.

In a statement, his representative told DailyMail.com: 'Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police.

'These types of false stories are wrong and damaging to the investigation.

'Jussie has provided his phone records and multiple statements to police, and Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible.

Smollett said he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, at the time of the attack. He will not give his phone to police for them to verify

'Any reports to the contrary are simply false and misrepresent the Chicago Police Superintendent’s remarks regarding the status of the investigation.

'Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim.

'We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.'

In the initial police report, there is no mention of the fact that the attackers shouted 'this is MAGA country'.

Smollett performed a sold-out show at The Troubador in Los Angeles on Saturday and declared himself the 'gay Tupac'

Moore, who previously declined invitations to speak about the incident, is said to have given his phone data to the police last week and Jussie turned his over this morning, a source close to the pair revealed.

Now, the star's neighbors say they do not believe the attack took place quite like he said it did.

'I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did. I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here … Half the people are gay and the other half are black,' neighbor Agin Muhammad told The New York Post.

Another man, who would not give his name but spoke to the newspaper in a bar near where the attack is said to have taken place, accused the star of making it up entirely.

'It’s a lie, because Chicago is the most liberal city around. They have cameras everywhere … Why can’t they find the attack?' he asked.

Chicago PD has told DailyMail.com repeatedly that it has no reason to believe that Smollett or anyone else who has given statements about the attack is lying.

Other neighbors have also given statements to the police to say they saw two suspicious men outside the apartment building the night of the attack including one who seemed to be carrying a rope that was similar to the one Smollett had around his neck when the police found him at his apartment 40 minutes afterwards.

Investigators are working round the clock to find the assailants but are yet to catch a single break in the case.

Last week, a hot-sauce bottle containing what smelled like bleach was handed in to the department after being found on the street.

It is not clear if that bottle contained the liquid that was used to attack Smollett on the night in question.

Brandon Z. Moore, the manager who said he was on the phone with Smollett in an interview with Variety within days of the attack, declined to speak with DailyMail.com.

During his first public appearance since the attack on Saturday, Smollett said he was the 'gay Tupac' as he addressed a sold-out show at The Troubador in Los Angeles.

It was his 60-year-old friend Frank Gatson who called 911 after Smollett returned home.

He had collected the star from the airport then driven him back to his apartment and stayed at home while he went out to get his sandwich.

Gatson then insisted Smollett report the attack despite the actor's reluctance to involve the authorities."

Don Lemon is opening up about how the recent attack allegedly suffered by “Empire” star Jussie Smollett affected him personally.

The CNN host appears in a special new episode of Jada Pinkett Smith’s Facebook Watch series “Red Table Talk”.

In the interview, Lemon is asked about the alleged racist and homophobic attack on Smollett in Chicago by two masked men.

“My initial reaction was sadness,” Lemon says. “I wasn’t shocked. I didn’t like that it happened to him. I called him because we have mutual friends.”

Lemon also reveals that he called Smollett soon after hearing about the attack to check in on him.

“I talked to Jussie for a minute and he said, ‘I gotta go, the doctor’s here’ and it just made me sad,” he says. “Everyone talks about, ‘Well, this happened and that happened.’ My concern is for him.”

During the interview Lemon addresses his criticism of Kevin Hart, who last year stepped down as Oscars host after his old homophobic tweets emerged.

“Everyone was like, ‘Don Lemon is going after Kevin Hart.’ I wasn’t going after Kevin Hart,” Lemon explains. “I wanted Kevin to understand and to hear from people who look like me. It doesn’t mean Kevin has to go around carrying a rainbow flag marching in a parade. That’s not his prerogative, he doesn’t have to do that.”

He continues, “He’s apologized. We should accept it. We can’t bully him into doing or being someone he doesn’t want to be or whatever and I think we need to move on and let Kevin be Kevin right?”"

For the interview, hosts Jada Pinkett Smith, daughter Willow and mom Adrienne Banfield-Norris traveled to New York.

""As black gay men, we carry the racism part, and we carry the gay part,"" Lemon said. ""We're already a class of people who have been discriminated against, so why do I want to have another mark against me?""

""Historically, black men have stayed in the closet,"" the anchor added. ""You have to decide your identity: Do I want to be black, or do I want to be gay?""

Lemon said he was saddened but ""wasn't shocked"" by the attack on Smollett and said he called him after and texts him daily.

""Every day I say, 'I know you think I'm annoying' – I can show you a text – 'I know you think I'm annoying you, but I just want to know that you're OK, and if you need somebody you can talk to me, 'cause there's not a lot of us out there,' "" Lemon recalled. ""Sometimes he responds; sometimes he doesn't. He responds and says, 'You are not annoying.' ""

When asked if he was afraid following the act of violence, Lemon said he had been living with angst.

""I've had fear recently... because of the political environment,"" he said. ""I get death threats... I have security, all of these things that happened. Listen, we've always been divided ideologically, but there's something different going on now.""

Smollett shared in a statement obtained by USA TODAY Feb. 1 that he was doing OK.

""Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger,"" Smollett wrote. ""More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

Smollett said his attackers poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him, placed a rope around his neck and used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett later told police his assailants yelled “This is MAGA country!”

""I don't believe it happened the way he said it did,"" Agin Muhammad, who lives in the apartment complex as the actor, the New York Post reported. ""I've been in this neighborhood five years. I don't believe it, not around here. … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.""

A patron at Lizzie McNeill's Irish Pub — about a block from the scene of the alleged Jan. 29 incident — told the paper that Smollett's account ""doesn't really make sense.""

""It's a lie, because Chicago is the most liberal city around,"" the man told the Post without giving his name. ""They have cameras everywhere. … Why can't they find the attack?""

What's the background?

Numerous media outlets ran with a TMZ report saying the actor was beaten up after walking out of a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. by two white men wearing ski masks who asked, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before pouring bleach on him, putting a noose around his neck, and yelling, ""This is MAGA country!""

Chicago Police told TheBlaze there was ""no mention of MAGA"" in initial reports, but when detectives followed up with Smollett later on the day of the attack, he recalled the offenders making those comments, and detectives completed a supplemental report.

Smollett's music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, told ABC News he was on the phone with Smollett during the attack and that he heard ""MAGA country"" spoken: ""I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle, and I heard the racial slur.""

Chicago police told the network they spoke with Moore and that his account is in the police report — but they haven't yet confirmed it with phone records. Police added to ABC News that Smollett and Moore told them they were on the phone together.

Smollett won't turn over phone



But police said Sunday that Smollett hasn't turned over cellphone data to verify that he was on the phone with Moore at the time, which allegedly took place at an underpass between the Sheraton and Loews Chicago hotels, the Post said.

""We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi added to the paper. ""We offered to take the phone to download the data, and he expressed he couldn't be without his phone for several hours.""

Police didn't specify the race of the alleged suspects but did call it a ""possible racially charged assault and battery"" and that they are ""treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Smollett reportedly was wearing rope 'like a necktie'



Police told ABC News that Smollett was seen on camera walking into an apartment with a rope around his neck and ""wearing it like a necktie"" before calling cops from inside the building.

CBS News said ""when police got to his apartment, they said a noose was still around Smollett's neck.""

Rob Elgas of WLS-TV in Chicago reported that ""when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed.""

Other curious details:

According to another tweet from Elgas, ""Smollett requested responding Chicago police officers turn off their body cameras as they arrived to take his report. A spokesman says this is not uncommon when officers enter a private residence.""

Elgas added that Chicago police have a security image of Smollett alone inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime, and that cops also obtained additional video placing him at the scene of the crime.

But sources told CBS News they've seen security video of Smollett outdoors early Tuesday morning and ""nothing of an assault.""

The weather in Chicago at midnight Jan. 29 — two hours before the alleged attack — showed a low temperature of 1 degree with 14-mph winds.

Guglielmi told The Associated Press that detectives have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area and are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the individuals who match Smollett's description.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave,"" Guglielmi added to the AP.

Although police have asked for help from the public in identifying two persons of interest from surveillance recordings near the site of the attack near the time it occurred.

The AP added that Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses, and in train tunnels — and that police said such cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that if police suspect Smollett's story is a hoax, he will be held accountable.

&lt;br&gt;

Other details

A threatening letter and drawing to Smollett was sent to the Fox television studio in Chicago on Jan. 22, police told ABC News, and it contained a powdery substance that investigators believe was likely crushed-up Tylenol.

The Post said last week it traced Smollett's likely route to the underpass from a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop where he bought a tuna sandwich and a salad, and that near the foot of a stairwell to the Loews, the paper found an empty hot sauce bottle that was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach.

Guglielmi told the Post that after police seized the bottle it was turned over to the FBI for analysis; the FBI declined to comment.

What has Smollett said?



""There's a lot of stuff that's been said about me that's absolutely not true,"" Smollett said during a previously scheduled show at the Troubadour club in Los Angeles just a few days after the alleged attack. ""I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken.

""I went to the doctor immediately. Frank Gatson drove me. I was not hospitalized,"" he added. ""Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously.""

Smollett also told the cheering crowd that ""above all, I fought the f*** back. I'm the gay Tupac.""

Earlier during the show Smollett told the crowd that ""I'm gonna stand strong with y'all, and I had to be here tonight ... I couldn't let those motherf***ers win.""

""If you are a famous actor and you belong to an organization that hates a certain group of people, don't be surprised if someone simply wonders why it's not addressed,"" she tweeted. ""Being anti LGBTQ is wrong, there aren't two sides. The damage it causes it severe. Full stop. Sending love to all.""

Being anti LGBTQ is wrong, there aren’t two sides. The damage it causes is severe. Full stop. Sending love to all — Ellen Page (@EllenPage) February 9, 2019

Page on Thursday criticized Chris Pratt for attending a ""infamously anti-LGBTQ"" church after he appeared on ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" and discussed his religious side.

The ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star sat down with Colbert to promote ""The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part,"" and Pratt said he just finished a 21-day Daniel Fast that he took part in through his church and that his pastor encouraged. He also said the pastor shared with him words of wisdom about balancing fame and his inner self.

""If the spotlight that is shining on you is brighter than the light that's within you, it will kill you,"" Pratt recounted to Colbert.

Page tweeted about the appearance and the pastor shortly after, writing, ""Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too?""

Pratt attends Hillsong Church, which other celebrities like Kendall and Kylie Jenner and Justin Bieber have also flocked to. The megachurch was founded in Australia but now has locations in New York City and Los Angeles.

Carl Lentz, who leads the New York branch, came under fire for saying in 2015 that homosexuality is a sin and that a gay member could never hold a leadership position. And that same year, when two male choir members of the church got married, Brian Houston, the church's global senior pastor, released a statement against them.

Pratt's rep did not immediately respond to Variety's request for comment, and Hillsong Church did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.

Page, who appeared in the ""X-Men"" films as Kitty Pryde and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2007 for her role in ""Juno,"" came out as gay in 2014 and has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights. She co-hosted the 2016 Viceland documentary series ""Gaycation"" about LGBTQ cultures around the world.

She appeared on the ""Late Show"" Jan. 31 ahead of the premiere of her Netflix series ""The Umbrella Academy."" There, she spoke out against the racist, homophobic attack on ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett, and condemned Vice President Mike Pence's anti-LGBTQ policies and his support of conversion therapy.

""If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them -- you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen?"" Page said. ""Kids are going to be abused, and they're going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you can meet. I am lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this. This needs to f--ing stop.""

The collage reportedly was spotted at Roosevelt Middle School and came to light after Pastor Arthur Mackey shared photos of the collage on Facebook this weekend. The photos show the bottom end of the collage featuring two nooses with “Ha” and “#Yes” written next to them.

It was shared with him through a teacher at the school, he told the Daily Dot, adding that several teachers who have since left the school confirmed the presence of the poster.

“I got this disturbing information on Saturday,” he told the Daily Dot. “Then, to add insult to injury, I learned that it had been hanging up for several months in one of the teacher’s classroom. That truly crossed the line.”

As he also noted in the viral Facebook post: “Dolls with nooses around the necks were also distributed to the children of color by these three teachers at Roosevelt Middle School in Nassau County, Long Island, New York.”

Mackey wasn’t able to confirm the timing of the dolls being distributed but said that he learned about them from the same person who notified him about the collage.

The Roosevelt School District is reportedly investigating the incident. They said “appropriate action” has been taken for the “inappropriate conduct” but it is not clear the specific nature of the repercussion.

Mackey is calling for the teachers to be fired. “We call on this school to fire anyone who was involved in this display of this racist images which boils down to a hate crime,” he told the Daily Dot.

Mackey, who himself attended the Roosevelt public school system, says this was a “slap on the face” of the community.

“I cannot imagine what type of excuse [there] would be used to justify such a horrendous hate-crime,” he said. “We’ll see in the upcoming days what kind of response comes up. This type of thing is not a joke.”

Whether or not the teachers intended it to be a joke remains irrelevant at a time when the noose is back to being used as a racist statement. The noose, as the NAACP claims, is “a symbol of the racist, segregation-era violence enacted on blacks. It remains a stark symbol of violent racism.”

It continues to haunt Black Americans to this day—as recently as in May, a noose was left at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Workers at a General Motors in Ohio continue to complain of nooses left hanging in the workplace. More recently, Empire actor Jussie Smollett was attacked by two men who reportedly put a noose around him in what’s being investigated as a hate crime.

In this particular case, it doesn’t help that nearly 50 percent of the students at the Roosevelt Middle School are African-American, and 55 percent are Latino students.

“It seems like students in the class were deceived that they thought in an environment with a loving teacher but actually there were acts of racism going on right under their noise,” said Mackey, adding that such acts “instill racism and inferiority into the hearts and minds of the children defeats purpose of education.”

Kamala Harris is one of the most talked about candidates running for president. However, there have been some questions about her identity and she has been accused of dodging explicitly saying she is Black. The former prosecutor addressed that on “The Breakfast Club” radio show Monday morning.

“So I was born in Oakland, and raised in the United States except for the years that I was in high school in Montreal, Canada,” Harris told the crew. “And look, this is the same thing they did to Barack (Obama). This is not new to us and so I think that we know what they are trying to do. They are trying to do what has been happening over the last two years, which is powerful voices trying to sow hate and division, and so we need to recognize when we’re being played.”

She also said, “I think they don’t understand who black people are. I’m not going to spend my time trying to educate people about who black people are. Because right now, frankly, I’m focused on, for example, an initiative that I have that is called the ‘LIFT Act’ that is about lifting folks out of poverty.”

But in case people weren’t’ clear, she added, “I’m Black, and I’m proud of being Black. I was born Black. I will die Black, and I’m not going to make excuses for anybody because they don’t understand.” See the interview below; the discussion about race starts around the 12:30 mark.

To be fair, part of the reason why Harris’ identity has been questioned is because of her own words. On the day she announced her candidacy, she conducted her first press conference at the historically Black Howard University. She was asked a variety of questions but when asked about how she identifies, she simply said she was a “proud American.”

The reporter asked, “You’re an African-American woman, but you are also Indian American. How do you describe yourself?”

Harris succinctly responded, “How do I describe myself? I describe myself as a proud American.”

While at a CNN Town Hall with Jake Tapper, Harris consistently referred to herself as a woman of color, which some folks interpreted that was he dodging saying Black. See below:

""My mother used to have a saying, and she would say to me: 'Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you're not the last,'” Kamala Harris says about possibly being the first black female president. #HarrisTownHall https://t.co/0EMGUsQFut pic.twitter.com/8HyRItLaH1 — CNN (@CNN) January 29, 2019

While many people are excited about Harris’ run, there are questions about her rough history as it relates to criminal justice. As Attorney General of California, she was a huge advocate of truancy laws that charged parents a fee for their children being truant and locking the parent up if they could not pay the fee. A Medium.com article from June ripped into Harris, “Kamala Harris’ career was built on both the slave labor of black and brown prisoners and also the pettiness of truancy laws that separated poor and mostly black mothers from their children. Harris was so proud of her history with taking mothers from their children that she used it as her signature campaign agenda while running for AG.”

Also, Harris didn’t specifically address reportedly advocating for California’s horrific three-strikes law in “The Breakfast Club” interview.

Right now, the Chicago Police Department is looking for leads in the case to try and find the alleged suspects who attacked Smollett in a reported racist and homophobic attack. The Empire star has been cooperative with police so far, but he has refused to hand over his cellphone as evidence to confirm a few things, including that he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack like he said he was.

According to the NY Post, some of Smollett’s neighbors in the upscale Chicago neighborhood that Smollett lives are not too sure that the attack happened, or at least not in the way that Jussie described it did.

“I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did,” a neighbor who lives near Smollett says.

“I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.”

Another person who is familiar with the neighborhood says that since Chicago is such a liberal place, he has doubts in his mind that the attack ever even happened. He also points out the fact that there are cameras on almost every street corner in Chicago and not one has caught the attack on Smollett, which seems kind of fishy to him.

And as the Inquisitr recently shared, if it turns out that the attack was indeed a false claim, then Smollett will be held responsible. Right now, the Chicago Police are still investigating Smollett’s claims and looking for the alleged attackers but if they find out that it was a false report, police say that the actor will be “held accountable.”

As the Inquisitr reported, Smollett was reportedly subjected to racist and homophobic insults during the attack while two masked men threw an unknown chemical substance at him. Additionally, the men put a rope around his neck before they fled the scene, and there is also a surveillance video of Jussie walking into his apartment building with a rope around his neck.

There is also a video of two masked men walking in the area of the attack about 15-20 minutes before and police are trying to locate those two individuals for questioning. Smollett’s family has also released a statement on the attack, calling it “a racial, homophobic hate crime.” To end the statement, the Smollett family said that they will continue to work toward “love, equity, and justice.”

So far, no suspects have been arrested."

“It’s a lie, because Chicago is the most liberal city around,” said the man, who wouldn’t give his name. “They have cameras everywhere … Why can’t they find the attack?”

Police have said they found plenty of surveillance video, but none that captured the incident.

Meanwhile, Chicago investigators said on Sunday that Smollett has yet to turn over data from his mobile phone to verify that he was on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Moore, when he was allegedly attacked.

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

“We offered to take the phone to download the data and he expressed he couldn’t be without his phone for several hours.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has said that Smollett, 36, was being treated as a crime victim, but would be held accountable if cops learn he filed a false report.

Smollett told cops he was confronted by two men, one wearing a black mask, who hurled gay and racist epithets at him, calling him “’Empire’ f — t n — r” while he was walking home shortly before 2am.

The assailants allegedly punched Smollett in the face, doused him with a liquid — believed to be bleach — and tied a rope around his neck in an underpass between the Sheraton and Loews Chicago hotels.

Last week, The Post traced Smollett’s likely route to the underpass from a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop where he bought a tuna sandwich and a salad.

Now, two alleged neighbors have miraculously come forward to say the “Empire” actor is lying about being attacked.

Agin Muhammad, who told Page Six he lives in Smollett’s building, said, “I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did. I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here . . . Half the people are gay and the other half are black.”

Another person, who told Page Six he is a patron at an Irish bar a block from the scene of the alleged attack, dropped this gem: “It’s a lie, because Chicago is the most liberal city around. They have cameras everywhere. . . Why can’t they find the attack?”

Clearly, that anonymous person is delusional, since incidents like the Laquan McDonald murder to 15 men exonerated for false arrests show Chicago is far from “the most liberal city” and has an epic history of racism.

Either way, their accounts contradict that from another neighbor who said on Jan. 31 that she saw two suspicious people outside of the apartment building she and Smollett live in about 90 minutes before the assault. According to TMZ, the neighbor, who chose to remain unidentified, said, “She walked out of the building at 12:30 a.m. Tuesday to take her dogs out and saw the man near the door, pacing between the parking garage and entrance, looking agitated and smoking a cigarette. She says, ‘He looked out of place.’ He was a white man with scruff on his face wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood and blue jeans that were too short, exposing ‘thick, grey hunting socks’ with camel-colored dress shoes.”

She described him as looking like a “redneck.”

She also said she saw “what looked like a rope, or a clothesline, protruding from the bottom of his sweatshirt, made of white and blue material.” The neighbor also claimed there was another man about 300 feet away, who was near another entrance to the building. She was “creeped out” by the man, and after 5 minutes she went back in the building.

TMZ also reported the neighbor went to the building’s gym at 4 a.m. and saw a lot of security. The concierge explained the actor was attacked, she said. “When she told him what she saw, the concierge implored her to call a detective and gave her two phone numbers,” TMZ wrote. “She made contact that afternoon and downloaded a detective.”

On Jan. 9, while walking to a Subway, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor after he exited the restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Threatening letters directed at Smollett were reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago a week before. The cutout letters read, “You will die black f**.” See below:

The Chicago Police Department has dropped the ball from the beginning with their handling of the case in the media. First, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants. Then, hours later , there were two “persons of interest” on video. They also claimed the “Empire” actor “ refused ” to give the cops his phone. All of these inconsistent reports have prompted some to say Smollett fabricated the attack. Now the new neighbor and the man at the bar will create more suspicion.

Hopefully, the Chicago Police Department can stop babbling to the press and focus on their investigation.

As the survivor of a violent crime, I can attest that the aftermath is, in some ways, the hardest part. That’s when the physical pain, perhaps previously dulled by adrenaline, really kicks in—along with regrets, doubts, fears about the future, and that lingering beast known as PTSD.

Twelve years ago, after I was robbed and assaulted by two burglars in my apartment in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I had the support of family, friends, and even strangers. The police could have been less indifferent, but no one ever doubted a word of my story.

If only Jussie Smollett could say the same thing. At around 2 a.m. on January 29 in Chicago, the Empire actor and singer was beaten by two men whom he reported shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him, wrapped a rope around his neck, poured a substance believed to be bleach over his head, and shouted “MAGA country!” It happened eight days after Smollett received a threatening letter at FOX’s Chicago studio, where Empire is filmed. The attack left him bruised but not broken. It also left some skeptics questioning his version of events.

Citing supposed discrepancies in the story as repeated by Smollett to police, as well as his refusal to turn over his phone to detectives, cynics questioned whether the attack happened at all, dismissing it as a “hoax” and “fake news.” Was it a publicity stunt? Was it part of a left-wing plot to make “MAGA” enthusiasts and Donald Trump look bad? The skepticism put the victim of the crime on the defensive; a place that’s all too familiar to women—and to black men.



It’s where we always seem to end up, in a society so used to casting black men as the perpetrators of crime, rather than as the victims. Last week, it’s precisely where actor Liam Neeson placed random black men —“black bastards,” in his poorly chosen words — in the revenge parable that plunged him into scalding water.



Tellingly, Neeson’s recollection, which he said took place some 40 years ago, revolved around a black man raping a presumably white woman. In the climax of his story, Neeson was roaming the mean streets with a cosh (a blunt instrument similar to a blackjack), looking for any black man unlucky enough to provoke him to pay the bill of the one who had raped his friend. The crime of one black man, in the mind of the then-young actor, had become the crime of all black men.



Neeson says he’s since changed. But in so many ways, times haven’t changed with him.

If Smollett were white, would so many be intent on picking apart his account of what went down? Would the police have asked for his phone to verify that he was talking to his manager at the time of the attack? What difference did it make who was on the phone with him? Why did a black man have to become a defendant in his own attack?



It reminds me of what happened to Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Terry Crews, when he revealed that a white male Hollywood agent sexually assaulted him at a party in 2016. Doubting Thomases asked how such a big muscular guy — make that such a big, muscular, black guy — could have ended up in a #MeToo moment. Even some in the black community joined the naysaying chorus: Rapper 50 Cent trolled Crews on social media, while comedian D.L. Hughley recently called out Crews’ nonviolent response, saying, “God gave you muscles so you could say no and mean it.”

Rather than being unanimously applauded as the survivors they are, both Smollett and Crews ended up in the firing line of armchair critics. Many breaking news stories called Smollett’s assault a “possible hate crime” (and most media reports continue to do so), as if being asked “Aren’t you that f****t Empire n****r?” would make it anything else. The shadow-of-a-doubt reporting might have sown the seeds of disbelief that sprouted as speculation that Smollett orchestrated his own attack.



It’s so easy to assume the worst about a black man, regardless of what side of a crime he is on. Historically, when white women accused black men of sexual assault, the latter were usually considered guilty until proven innocent—and often even after—in the eyes of much of white America. The Central Park Five were a prime example.

In 1989, Donald Trump took out full-page ads damning and demonizing that group of young black and brown men accused of raping a white woman. Ironically, the reaction of now-President and “MAGA” architect Trump to Jussie Smollett’s attack said so much by saying so little:



“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get any worse.”



That’s it? Just a vague, nonspecific reaction, presumably intended to appease potential detractors without antagonizing “MAGA” flag wavers? If it had been, say, Neil Patrick Harris or Andy Cohen on the receiving end of those cowards’ fists, I wonder if Trump would have damned both the assault and the assaulters. If it had been just about homophobia without the lynching symbolism, would so many be so invested in it being a hoax?

Far-right columnist Michelle Malkin offered her biased take on the Smollett attack one day later in an op-ed for Creators Syndicate, writing:

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces wander around the upscale Streeterville neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about ‘MAGA country?’ Question: How many racist homophobic menaces have ever heard of ‘Empire,’ could recognize Jussie Smollett, or know or care anything about his sexuality?

In addition to dealing with hate crimes, must we now explain the psychology and pop-cultural predilections behind them, too? Why can some Americans only accept a status quo in which black men are the aggressors, out to sully white women and annihilate white men? The spin begins every time an unarmed black man is gunned down by a white cop and it somehow becomes the black man’s fault. A not-guilty verdict precludes having to rethink the racist narrative.



Smollett has been a vocal LGBTQ activist and opponent of Trump. Is it so unfathomable that two men, triggered by a gay black celebrity criticizing their beloved president might have sent a threatening letter to Smollett at work as a prelude to a planned attack? Smollett has less to gain by staging a racist, homophobic attack than “MAGA” flag wavers do by pretending it never happened.

If it didn’t happen, they can continue to see “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” as nothing more than a campaign slogan. They can shrug off the homophobia that still haunts the U.S., 50 years after the Stonewall Riots. They can ignore that from certain angles, Trump’s America looks a lot like 1955 Montgomery, Alabama, revisited.



Most of all, they can continue to subscribe to that old comfortable narrative that black men are the dangerous ones. They can go on living in a fairy tale where the black man is always the villain of the story, the “big, bad wolf,” huffing and puffing, trying to blow the house down.

February has been filled with racially charged controversies. Vintage symbols of racism like blackface and lynchings — matters we assumed were long-buried — are now revisiting us in the 21st century, from both sides of the political aisle.

First, there was the attack on actor Jussie Smollett last month. The “Empire” star was walking to his Chicago apartment when two men attacked him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs. One of the perpetrators placed a noose around Smollett’s neck and poured an unknown liquid on his head. Many celebrities and activists took to social media, sending their love and support.

Headlines by CNN and other media outlets labelling this incident as a “possible hate crime” were extremely problematic. Possible isn’t actual. As a journalist, I understand the importance of not jumping to conclusions; however, if someone puts a noose around a black person’s neck, that should be more than enough evidence. Does an actual lynching have to happen for people to wake up and say affirmatively that this is a crime done out of prejudice and hatred — in other words, an actual hate crime? And let’s be crystal clear, Smollett wasn’t attacked for being only gay or only black but because he is both.

Thankfully, he escaped with only bruises and minor injuries. Then, the headlines changed and we all thought that maybe that was as bizarre as it could get. But apparently, bad things really do come in threes.

In a synopsis of last week, both the Governor of Virginia and his attorney general admitted to wearing blackface in college. Let’s look at the overall significance of all of this and its possible consequences for the 2020 presidential elections.

Ralph Northam’s handling of this scandal has been unacceptable, and he has refused to step down in spite of calls for his resignation.

On Feb. 6, Virginia state Attorney General Mark Herring also confessed to having worn “dark makeup” back in his college days.

Personally, what has made these revelations particularly upsetting and hurtful is that both Northam and Herring are aligned with the party that I support.

African-Americans overwhelmingly voted for Northam. For him to refuse to step down is a slap in the face to the black people who helped get him into office. In the words of New York Times columnist Charles Blow, “Democrats owe Black people a debt.”

A scandal like this supports the arguments of many on the right, especially black conservatives like Candace Owens, that the Democratic Party cares about black votes and nothing more, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that the site behind the revelation of the Northam scandal has GOP operatives. Big League Politics, the far-right, pro-Trump website that posted a photo of Northam, is led by ideologically driven news publishers. They are using modern technology to commit the oldest trick in the book: divide and conquer. They know that they can’t get the majority of African-Americans to vote Republican, but they can make sure that they don’t give their votes to the Democrats.

Between now and November 2020, we will probably be seeing a lot more scandals like the one in Virginia, in addition to the surfacing of sexual assault allegations against Democratic lawmakers. The right’s plan is to cast the Democrats as an equally racist and sexist bunch, resulting in many black voters either voting as independents or not voting at all.

This isn’t to say that the members of the Democratic Party are angels; on the contrary, there are many things that need to change. But in politics, as in life, we have to pick our poison: the lesser evil.

“I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did,” said Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same swank high-rise near the Navy Pier as Smollett.

“I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.”

A patron at Lizzie McNeill’s Irish Pub, about a block from the scene of the alleged Jan. 29 incident, said Smollett’s story “doesn’t really make sense.”

“It’s a lie, because Chicago is the most liberal city around,” said the man, who wouldn’t give his name. “They have cameras everywhere … Why can’t they find the attack?”

Cops have said they found plenty of surveillance video, but none that captured the incident.

Meanwhile, Chicago police said Sunday that Smollett has yet to turn over data from his cellphone to verify that he was on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Moore, when he was allegedly attacked.

Moore has said he heard Smollett’s assailants shout a “racial slur” and the words “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

“We offered to take the phone to download the data and he expressed he couldn’t be without his phone for several hours.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has said that Smollett, 36, was being treated as a crime victim, but would be held accountable if cops learn he filed a false report.

Smollett told cops he was confronted by two men, one wearing a black mask, who hurled gay and racist epithets at him, calling him “’Empire’ f—-t n—-r” while he was walking home shortly before 2 a.m.

The assailants allegedly punched Smollett in the face, doused him with a liquid — believed to be bleach — and tied a rope around his neck in an underpass between the Sheraton and Loews Chicago hotels.

Last week, The Post traced Smollett’s likely route to the underpass from a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop where he bought a tuna sandwich and a salad.

Near the foot of a stairwell to the Loews, The Post found an empty hot sauce bottle that was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach.

The Post alerted police, who seized the bottle. Guglielmi said it was turned over to the FBI for analysis.

The FBI declined to comment.

While it seems like most everyone is a fan of Chris Pratt, who seems to remain humble despite his fame, one fellow celebrity isn’t so thrilled with The Lego Movie 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy star. Actress Ellen Page called out Pratt on Twitter following his recent interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and some fans were initially confused.

Pratt talked about his recent Daniel Fast diet on Colbert

Pratt was on The Late Show to discuss The Lego Movie 2, but the conversation turned to Pratt’s recent extreme diet called the Daniel Fast, a 21-day plan that his church pastor inspired him to do.

The actor explained: “I just came off it a couple days ago. It’s a 21-day fast. A lot of people are doing it. I did it through my church. It’s based on Daniel, the book of Daniel, the prophet Daniel from the Old Testament.”

The actor shared that Daniel “only ate fruits and vegetables and grains, and didn’t have any breads and didn’t have any animal products.”

Pratt called the experience ‘amazing’

Pratt revealed why he decided to take on the dietary challenge, explaining: “I was inspired by my pastor, we do it, it’s kind of like our Lent, you know, give something up. So for 21 days I had no meat, no sugar, no alcohol, and it was actually amazing. It was really cool.”

He added: “If you know how much I drink, you know that 21 days [is tough].”

His pastor also gave this perspective on how to balance fame with staying humble, as Pratt noted: “If the spotlight that is shining on you is brighter than the light that’s within you, it will kill you.”

Ellen Page slammed Pratt’s church

Page took to Twitter to share her thoughts on Pratt’s interview, tweeting: “Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too?”

Pratt goes to Hillsong Church, which is also attended by Justin Bieber, Kendall Jenner, and Kylie Jenner and has locations in New York City and Los Angeles. Carl Lentz, one of the lead pastors at Hillsong NYC, spoke in a 2015 GQ interview that the church’s position on homosexuality is that it’s a sin.

Page is outspoken about LGBTQ rights

Page, who came out as gay in 2014, chatted with Colbert recently about the attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett, sharing her thoughts on Mike Pence’s anti-LGBTQ policies. She explained: “If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them — you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen?”

She added: “Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you can meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f—ing stop.”"

A few years ago, during the previous administration, it seemed that the rights and freedoms for LGBTQ individuals were becoming more and more discussed. The legalization of gay marriage in the United States and groundbreaking developments in freedoms for transgender individuals might have even lulled the American people into a false sense of security regarding homophobia and transphobia in the country. The current administration has changed that. Even Vice President Mike Pence has been outspoken in his beliefs against homosexuality. In 2007, he voted against The Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would’ve prevented sexuality-based discrimination in the workforce, and even related homosexuality to “societal collapse.” His wife has also recently returned to her job as an art teacher at a school with discriminatory policies. While it might seem that the personal choices of these individuals in power may have little effect on day-to-day life, this administration’s choices are undoing decades of LGBTQ civil rights, and even putting lives at risk.

On Jan. 29, 36-year-old African American actor, musician and activist Jussie Smollett was brutally attacked by two individuals early that morning. The two attackers allegedly approached Smollett, hit his face, poured chemicals on him and tied a rope in the fashion of a noose around his neck, all while yelling out racial and homophobic slurs as well as the phrase “MAGA country.” Smollett, like his character on the hit television show “Empire,” is openly gay.

Smollett reported the attack and received treatment at Northwestern Hospital. No arrests have been made, and newly surfaced surveillance videos may lead to an eventual identification of the attackers. Smollett returned to the stage less than a week later the following Sunday, getting emotional before his music performance. He said, “Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. We hope that you all stand with us.”

This hate-fueled attack comes a week after a Supreme Court vote provided no legal changes or positions on the Trump administration’s ban on transgender individuals in the military, effectively holding the ban in place. Despite an opposing brief to the ban, which states that an individual’s gender identity doesn’t affect their quality as a soldier, the leaders of our nation are denying the right to serve and protect its citizens to those who want it most. If someone is willing to risk their life to protect our freedoms, why are we denying them basic freedoms of their own?

Policies and political support founded on fear and discrimination do nothing but embolden those who already maintain that mindset. While those who oppose the current administration’s statements and policies can easily brush off what they hear, those words have power. Individuals like the ones who attacked Smollett might start to think, “Well, if they are public in their hate, why can’t I be as well?” Actress Ellen Page put it best: “If you are in a position of power, and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering — what do you think is going to happen?”

The LGBTQ community has faced this kind of discrimination before with the HIV/AIDS crisis when the Reagan administration treated the disease and deaths of countless individuals as a joke until the epidemic had become too large to ignore. We simply cannot allow history to repeat itself in a similar manner. This is absolutely not the first and it sadly may not be the last time LGBTQ individuals face hate and discriminatory practices, but the community remains strong, open and full of love.

He claims he was approached by two men, one wearing a black mask to conceal his face. The pair verbally called out Smollett for his race and sexuality. They then attacked him, beating him mercilessly and throwing an unknown substance in his face. Following more racial slurs, the two men tied a rope around Smollett’s face and ran away. Now the Chicago Police Department is looking into how true the actor’s attack story really was, according to Global News.

Smollett is a black man who identifies openly as being gay. He is also known for the gay character that he plays on Empire. As soon as news broke regarding his attack, fellow actors and thousands across social media spoke out in support of Smollett. The incident raised the issue of racism and the vast amount of progress that still needs to be made in terms of acceptance for minority groups.

REPORT: Chicago PD intend to CHARGE Jussie Smollett if he filed a FALSE police report...https://t.co/Gp2QvOglyM — Chuck Callesto (@ChuckCallesto) February 10, 2019

Luckily, the actor survived the incident with minor injuries and was released from the hospital. He has made public appearances in the days following during which he has gone into further detail about the attack. He was quick to assure fans that despite being shaken up, he’s alright and refuses to allow the incident cause him to live a life of fear.

While many applauded Smollett for getting back out into the public eye so soon after his frightening experience, others pondered how much truth there was to his story and whether certain aspects of it had been embellished. Many wondered if much of the actor’s recount of events had been made up in order to stir up racial controversy.

Due to the amount of questioning in the media, the Chicago Police Department will be delving further into their investigation regarding the attack. If he did make a false report, he will be “held accountable,” police say. In terms of the suspects themselves, the authorities don’t have much to go upon, the CPD’s public report says.

“The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black. The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled.”

No arrests have been made in the case thus far and police are still trying to secure security footage from the night of the incident that may provide further insight into what really happened."
