0,1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/arts/television/jussie-smollett-court-not-guilty.html,"CHICAGO — The “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty on Thursday morning to 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct stemming from his report of a hate-crime attack that the police say was staged.

Smollet’s lawyer Tina Glandian entered the plea on Smollet’s behalf an hour after Judge Steven Watkins was assigned the high-profile case. Smollett, dressed in a dark blue suit, blue overcoat and scarf, stood silently as Glandian addressed the court.

The plea comes six weeks after Smollett filed a police report on Jan. 29 that caught attention around the world. In the report, he told the police that he was jumped while walking in downtown Chicago just after midnight. Smollett, who is black and openly gay, said two masked men shouted racist and homophobic slurs before physically assaulting him, pouring a chemical on him and placing a rope around his neck. He also said the assailants told him he was in “MAGA country,” a reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

The Chicago police investigated Smollet’s claims, dedicating at least 12 detectives to the case, but when they found no evidence on surveillance video to support it, they began to examine Smollett’s story more closely. After questioning two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who knew Smollett, the police said the brothers implicated Smollett in a scheme to draw more attention to the actor in hopes that he would get a pay raise from “Empire.”",2019-03-14 00:00:00,Jussie Smollett Pleads Not Guilty to 16 Felony Charges in Chicago,['Robert Chiarito'],"['plea', 'chicago', 'glandian', 'charges', 'brothers', 'smollets', '16', 'smollett', 'case', 'told', 'pleads', 'empire', 'report', 'jussie', 'felony', 'guilty']",0

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges accusing him of lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in downtown Chicago a few weeks ago.

Lawyer Tina Glandian entered the plea on behalf of the 36-year-old actor during a hearing in Cook County Circuit Court after Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to oversee the case, including the trial.

Watkins granted Smollett's request to be allowed to meet with lawyers in New York and California, but said the actor must give the court at least 48 hours' prior notice. He scheduled the next hearing for April 17.

Smollett, who left the courthouse without speaking to reporters, is charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show, hired two friends to help him stage the attack on him in downtown Chicago early on the morning of Jan. 29. They say Smollett was unhappy about his salary and wanted to drum up publicity to help his career.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack and maintains he is innocent. His attorneys have called the charges against him ""prosecutorial overkill.""

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges accusing him of lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in downtown Chicago a few weeks ago.

Lawyer Tina Glandian entered the plea on behalf of the 36-year-old actor during a hearing in Cook County Circuit Court after Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to oversee the case, including the trial.

Watkins granted Smollett’s request to be allowed to meet with lawyers in New York and California, but said the actor must give the court at least 48 hours’ prior notice. He scheduled the next hearing for April 17.

Smollett is charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

Tina Tchen, who worked as former first lady Michelle Obama’s chief of staff during her time in the White House, first contacted Kim Foxx by text on Feb. 1 and said the actor's family had ""concerns"" about the investigation, according to the communications. Tchen, a Chicago-based attorney, is also the co-founder of the Times Up Legal Defense Fund.

At the time of the correspondence, Smollett was still considered by police to be the victim of an assault. The actor was later charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false report for allegedly staging an attack to make him look like the victim of a brutal hate crime.

“Spoke to the Superintendent Johnson,” Foxx emailed Tchen on Feb. 1, referring to the city’s top cop, Eddie Johnson. “I convinced him to Reach out to FBI to ask that they take over the investigation.”

Foxx also texted with one of Smollett’s relatives, whose name was redacted in copies of the communication released by her office.

“Spoke to the superintendent earlier, he made the ask,” Foxx wrote. “Trying to figure out logistics. I’ll keep you posted.”

The relative responded, “Omg this would be a huge victory.”

“I make no guarantees, but I’m trying,” Foxx replied back.

Foxx recused herself from the investigation before Smollett was charged. Her first deputy, Joe Magats, is overseeing the case.

Foxx said in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times that Smollett's family was concerned that aspects of the police investigation were being leaked to media.

“They had no doubt about the quality of the investigation, but believed that the FBI would have a tighter lid on the information,” Foxx told the outlet.

Johnson said in an interview with USA TODAY that he told Foxx he was “amenable” to conversations about having the FBI take the lead in the Smollett investigation. But ultimately, police and federal officials determined it was most appropriate that the investigation continue to be led by Chicago Police. The FBI had been providing city police with technical assistance since soon after it launched its investigation.

“I did speak to the FBI because they handle hate crimes,” Johnson said. “We had conversations about it, but at the end of the day it stayed where it should have, in my opinion.”

Tchen did not respond to a request for comment.

A grand jury indicted Smollett last week on 16 felony counts, accusing him of staging a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men near his Chicago apartment.

Police allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the Jan. 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to bolster his profile.

He told police that two assailants beat him and threw a rope around his neck while hurling racial and anti-gay slurs at him. Smollett also told police that one of the attackers also yelled, “This is MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan.

Police arrested two men, brothers who knew Smollett and had worked with him on “Empire,” weeks after the incident and identified them as suspects. They later released the brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, without charge.

The brothers told police that Smollett plotted the assault, gave them money to purchase supplies for the ruse and paid them $3,500 for taking part in the alleged plot.

Smollett is free on $100,000 bond. He’s scheduled to appear in court Thursday.

Senate to vote on Trump's border wall emergency

Senate lawmakers face a key vote Thursday: whether to uphold or reject President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency to build his proposed border wall. Trump made the move in February to free up billions of dollars for the wall, with most of the money coming from the Pentagon. Four Senate Republicans say they will side with Democrats to support a resolution to rescind it, making a defeat nearly certain. Because the House has already approved the resolution against the emergency, the measure's OK the Senate would send the matter to the president's desk. But Trump could sign the first veto of his administration, and it's unlikely House Democrats would be able to garner enough GOP support to override it. Win or lose, the vote will be a test of Trump's power.

O'Rourke announces White House run

After months of intense speculation, Beto O'Rourke announced that he's running for president in 2020 on Thursday. O'Rourke, a Texas Democrat who was narrowly defeated by Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterms, is viewed by some Dems as a ""young rock star."" In a December Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, 11 percent of likely Democratic caucus-goers said O'Rourke, 46, was their first choice for president — putting him behind only former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The former congressman told Oprah Winfrey last month that his decision to run for the White House will come down to his family: his wife Amy and his three children, Ulysses, Molly and Henry.

Jussie Smollett to appear at court hearing

Jussie Smollett, the 'Empire' actor accused by Chicago police of staging a fake hate crime for personal profit, is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday on 16 felony charges. On Jan. 29, Smollett claimed he was attacked in the middle of the night on a downtown street by masked men shouting homophobic and racist abuse. Police alleged he had paid two friends more than $3,000 to stage the attack as a ploy to boost his profile and get a raise in salary. He was later charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct stemming from the alleged false police report. In a hearing Tuesday, Smollett's legal team said they ""welcome"" cameras in the courtroom ""so (the public) can see evidence and lack thereof"" as prosecutors present their case.

Tesla to unveil new Model Y SUV

Tesla founder Elon Musk on Thursday will unveil the all-electric car maker's next vehicle — the Model Y compact SUV — at an event in Los Angeles. Musk tweeted that the Model Y will be about 10 percent larger than the Model 3 sedan and will ""cost about 10 percent more & have slightly less range for same battery."" With Model 3 orders often selling for more than $50,000, that could put a typical Model Y in the $55,000 range. It will share the same platform as the Model 3 to save costs and will feature normal doors – not the falcon-wing doors of the Model X SUV, Musk tweeted. Here's what this Model 3 owner says about whether her yearning has been fulfilled.

He has denied the charges.

One of Smollett's lawyers, Tina Glandian, entered the plea on Smollett's behalf.

Prior to the arraignment, Judge Steven G. Watkins was assigned to oversee Smollett's case. Watkins made a small change to the terms of Smollett’s bond, saying he will allow Smollett to travel Los Angeles and New York to meet with attorneys without first formally seeking court approval.

Smollett's next court date was set for April 17.

Smollett huddled with his attorneys at the courthouse for more than 30 minutes after the hearing. He and his legal team left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.

Prosecutors, led by Assistant State's Attorney Risa Lanier, also did not comment.

“Empire” star Terrence Howard, who has publicly expressed support for Smollett, planned to attend Thursday’s hearing. He ended up missing it, because he got stuck at the airport while waiting to pick up his wife, whose fight was delayed, according to Smollett spokeswoman Anne Kavanagh.

The actor's legal team said Tuesday that they wanted cameras in the courtroom so the public could see the evidence. Celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos, who joined Smollett's Chicago-based legal team in late February, argued that the worldwide media coverage has robbed Smollett of the presumption of innocence. He said he was not surprised by the indictment.

""What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie,"" Geragos said in a statement last week. ""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records.""

Local shock, a nationwide outcry, and an urgent Chicago police investigation ensued.

While messages of support for Smollett from his famous friends, from presidential candidates and total strangers poured in over social media, police busied themselves watching hours of surveillance video and searching for two murky figures Smollett said were the attackers.

They argued with Smollett about access to his cellphone, they served search warrants, and they eventually arrested two brothers they suspected were the two men on the surveillance video.

For nearly 48 hours – the limit police could hold them – the bodybuilder brothers Ola Osundairo, 27, and Abel Osundairo, 25, were interrogated until, police said, they explained: Smollett, whom they knew through ""Empire"" and working out together, had paid them to help him stage a hoax attack.

On Feb. 20, after a flurry of conflicting leaks from the Chicago Police Department about the status of the investigation (Smollett is a victim, he's not a victim, it is a hoax, it is not a hoax), Smollett was charged by police with one Class 4 felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report about the alleged attack.",2019-03-14 20:11:51+00:00,Jussie Smollett pleads not guilty to lying to police about alleged attack,"['Maria Puente', 'Aamer Madhani']","['hearing', 'alleged', 'chicago', 'smolletts', 'team', 'lying', 'smollett', 'investigation', 'court', 'hoax', 'pleads', 'attack', 'legal', 'jussie', 'guilty']",8

According to Variety, Jussie Smollett has entered a not guilty plea on the charges that he allegedly staged the January 29 attack in Chicago in which he claimed that two men yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him, and tied a noose around his neck. The police in Chicago later announced that they had come to believe that the attackers were hired by Smollett, possibly because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on Fox’s Empire and wanted attention, and Smollett was then charged with 16 felony counts related to every alleged lie he made to authorities about the incident—a move that his attorney referred to as “overkill.” Smollett and his team, meanwhile, have maintained his innocence, which is where today’s not guilty plea comes in.

If Smollett is convicted, Variety says he could be facing three years in prison, but there’s a chance he could just get probation. Either way, it seems like his future on Empire is a big question, since he was recently cut from the final episodes of the current season.

Smollett’s lawyer Mark Geragos called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill” in a statement.

Smollett initially claimed that he was the victim of a hate crime on January 29, telling police that two men had accosted him, beat him, called him homophobic and racist slurs, put a rope around his neck, and poured bleach on him before running away. On February 13, brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were taken into custody and questioned in relation to the alleged attack. After police spoke with the Osundairos and inconsistencies arose in Smollett’s testimony, the actor was deemed a suspect in a separate case investigating his claims.

Smollet turned himself into authorities on February 21 and was released on bond later that day. Following the charges, “Empire” producers (including Lee Daniels) issued a statement announcing that Smollett would be cut from the final two episodes of the show’s next season in order to “avoid further disruption on set.”",,"Jussie Smollett Pleads Not Guilty to Felony Charges, Stemming From Allegedly Staged Attack","['Condé Nast', 'Noah Yo', 'Evan Minske', 'Madison Bloom', 'Matthew Strauss', 'Noah Yoo', 'Jazz Monroe']","['smolletts', 'staged', 'called', 'allegedly', 'charges', 'hate', 'smollett', 'victim', 'stemming', 'pleads', 'crime', 'attack', 'empire', 'reports', 'jussie', 'felony', 'guilty']",12

Smollett appeared in court in Chicago to answer the indictment, which a grand jury returned last Friday. If convicted, the “Empire” star could face three years in prison, though it is also possible he would be sentenced to probation.

Smollett is accused of staging an attack on himself on Jan. 29. He told police that two men attacked him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. Police were able to track the two men using surveillance images and taxi and rideshare records.

Chicago police say Smollett staged a racist, homophobic attack on himself. Smollett said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two white men in ski masks. The actor said the men told him “this is MAGA country,” tied a rope around his neck, and poured bleach on him. Police say the attack was a hoax.

Smollett, 36, was arrested Feb. 20, about three weeks after the alleged incident initially portrayed by the gay and black actor as a hate crime. He later was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for making false reports.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” his attorney, Mark Geragos, said in a statement released to PEOPLE after those indictments were announced.

Smollett and his legal team previously said they are gearing up to launch an “aggressive defense,” according to his attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” Pugh and Henderson said in a statement given to PEOPLE. “Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

Smollett claimed to police that he’d been physically attacked on the street in his downtown Chicago neighborhood around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two black-clad, masked men who used racist and homophobic slurs, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and left him with a rope around his neck.

“To be perfectly honest, from the very beginning we had questions,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a news conference after Smollett had been charged.

Those questions dogged Smollett for weeks, during which he also received widespread support and sympathy in response to his allegations. Investigators ultimately alleged the attack was a hoax he staged with two acquaintances, to whom he reportedly paid $3,500 for their participation, to allegedly help boost his salary on the hit FOX TV show.

“When we discovered the actual motive,” said Johnson, “quite frankly it pissed everybody off.”

Two brothers, Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, later issued a public apology for their role in the staged attack, expressing “tremendous regret” for their actions, according to a statement from their attorney.

Their attorney later said the check they received was meant to cover both the attack and personal training services for Smollett. They also allegedly received $100 from Smollett to buy the ski masks, rope and gloves they were to use in the alleged attack.

The brothers have not been charged.

The brothers had been seen on surveillance footage the night of the incident and later questioned by police, who arrested the men but soon released them after they admitted their alleged participation and pointed the blame back at Smollett.

Police said several factors helped crack the case.

Interviewed at Northwestern Hospital after the alleged attack, Smollett claimed he’d been beaten by two men who shouted racial, homophobic and “political statements” at him, hung a noose around his neck, threw bleach at him and then fled on foot, police Commander Edward Wodnicki told reporters last month.

Police reviewed hundreds of hours of video from surveillance cameras in the area, starting with those focused on the street near the reported incident. The alleged attack itself was not captured, but police quickly obtained and shared images of two men “that we believed were the likely offenders,” he said.

Authorities were able, via surveillance video and witness accounts, to backtrack the men’s movements to a ride-share service whose pay account revealed their identities. Police then discovered that the two men had traveled to O’Hare airport and left the country using round-trip tickets to Nigeria, with a scheduled return to Chicago on Feb. 13.

The interim allowed police to issue more than 50 search warrants and subpoenas for phone and other records that showed the men had been in contact with Smollett — including one hour before the alleged attack, one hour afterward, and while they were out of the country, said Johnson.

Police met and arrested the men upon their return. But after the men requested an attorney, Gloria Schmidt, “she came to us and after speaking with these two people of interest, she said that something smelled fishy,” said Wodnicki. “She came to me and said, ‘You really need to talk to these guys, I’m going to allow them to give you a video interview with us present and we’re going to have you hear their story. They are not offenders, they’re victims.’”

Wodnicki added: “It was at this time that this investigation started to spin in a completely new direction.”

If Smollett is found guilty, falsifying a police report is a Class 4 felony which carries a potential sentence of up to three years in prison.

After being arrested and quickly posting a bond that allowed his release from jail last month, Smollett returned to the Chicago set of Empire, the Fox drama in which he stars as main character Jamal Lyon.",,Jussie Smollett Pleads Not Guilty to Charges Accusing Him of Lying to Police About Alleged Hate Attack,['Jeff Truesdell'],"['accusing', 'alleged', 'chicago', 'allegedly', 'charges', 'men', 'lying', 'statement', 'later', 'smollett', 'jussie', 'pleads', 'attack', 'video', 'hate', 'guilty']",15

With lawyers and family in the Cook County courthouse, Smollett’s attorney , Tina Glandian expectedly plead “not guilty” for the subdued actor to the 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct. First charged and arrested on February 21 over the seemingly violent January 29 incident that Chicago PD initially considered a “potential hate crime,” Smollett was indicted on the more than a dozen new charges on March 8.

Smollett will next be due in court on April 17.

Currently out on $100,000 bail, the actor who plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon on the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong created Fox series could face more than three years behind bars and a $25,000 fine on each count of misrepresentation to cops and detectives. Despite a flood of evidence that prosecutors presented in that late February hearing, Smollett has always insisted on his innocence and that he did not stage the attack.

Earlier this morning, trial Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to the case and to conduct this morning’s arraignment. At today’s hearing, Judge Watkins gave a slight expansion to Smollett’s travel restrictions. The actor is now allowed to freely travel to L.A. and to NYC to consult with his lawyers on the case.

After Smollett was arrested on February 21, Chicago prosecutors read out in court a lengthy series of text messages between Smollett and brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo that painted a picture of a clearly pre-planned attack. Far from the racist and homophobic assault Smollett first describes in late January, the texts detailed preparing money to buy supplies, buying drugs, setting up meetings and ensuring that MAGA hats and chants were part of the assault.

In a searing live press conference on that same day, CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said it was “shameful’ what Smollett allegedly try to pull off and accused him of perpetuating a “hoax.” The Windy City’s top cop also claimed that UTA-repped Smollett orchestrated the apparent fake attack because he was dissatified with his more than $120,00 per episode paycheck on Empire. That is not a point that prosecutors seem to have pursued in their case and one that various sources at Fox and others close to Smollett have scoffed at.

Today’s hearing also comes mere hours after the midseason return of Empire last night after an absence of several months

Though, Smollett has been written out of the final two episodes of the present fifth season, the actor was front and center in the long since filmed “My Fault Is Past” episode on Wednesday.

It was a prominence that sometimes felt a bit too unavoidably close to reality as he delivered lines like “We aint going to beat nobody’s ass.” Amid the usual Lyon family intrigue that the episode unveiled, at one point Smollett’s Jamal actually said “I don’t know if y’all been reading the blogs and all the foolishness, but it’s kinda been a tough week.”

Speaking of the week, today was actually Smollett’s second appearance in court this week.

The actor unexpectedly showed up at a procedural hearing on March 12 for his California-based primary defense lawyer Mark Geragos to enter the necessary paperwork to represent Smollett in the state of Illinois. Cable news talking head Geragos, who called the recent indictments “prosecutorial overkill,” was not in court today, but his associate Glandian did the necessary heavy lifting.

19,1,https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-jussie-smolletts-shocking-empire-return-its-kind-of-been-a-tough-week,"“I don’t know if you’ve been reading the blogs and all that foolishness, but it’s kind of been a tough week,” says Jussie Smollett as his character, Jamal Lyon, in Wednesday’s episode of Empire.

Of course, the statement rings true for the embattled actor on- and off-screen. In Fox’s primetime soap, Jamal is torn between choosing his journalist fiancé or his morally corrupt family; but, in a rare instance for the always dramatic Empire, tensions are even higher behind the scenes, as Smollett faces 16 counts of disorderly conduct, including filing a false police report—a Class 4 felony offense.

Empire returned tonight in its first episode since the Chicago Police Department initially considered Smollett the victim of a racist, homophobic attack, and is now accusing him of staging a hate crime for publicity. Smollett maintains his innocence and will appear in court on Thursday.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson alleges Smollett paid $3,500 for two Empire extras, brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, to stage the “attack” in order to boost his status on the show. “The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary. So he concocted a story about being attacked,” Johnson said in a February press conference. Smollett’s lawyers later disputed the claim to CNN, saying Smollett is the victim of a “media lynching,” and claimed that the $3,500 check was for personal training.

Wednesday’s episode makes zero mention of the allegations, sticking to business as usual with its own scandalous storyline of a data breach and family extortion. Smollett features prominently in the episode, even performing two musical numbers. In the first, Jamal returns to his high school alma mater to perform “Jump,” an anthem that opens with the verse, “I’m probably, I’m probably going through some battles, yeah / I’m probably, I’m probably gonna have to fight / But no, it ain’t nothing that I can’t handle / Eventually, I will be alright.”

Fox cut Smollett from the final two episodes of the season which are still being filmed, and showrunner Brett Mahoney spoke with Entertainment Weekly this week on the tough choice to remove him: “It was a very difficult decision, but I think in terms of allowing the cast and the crew to really get the work done without a great deal of disruption in terms of the day-to-day and the stress of the day-to-day, and, in addition, allowing Jussie the time to really deal with what he’s been confronted with and allow him the time to focus and prepare his case, this seems like the logical decision to make.” It’s unclear how long Smollett will be gone.

Mahoney wouldn’t confirm rumors that Smollett’s scandal has put Empire’s future in jeopardy. However, TMZ is reporting that some production members are feeling anxiety on set. Mahoney did acknowledge the weight of the case is palpable to those working on the show, saying, “Everyone is really focused on getting these episodes done, despite everything that is going on around us. Also, I don’t really see it as something that is dividing people, more like bringing people together, bringing the cast and crew together in terms of let’s get this done.”

Empire has yet to be renewed for Season 6, though that isn’t out of the norm. Fox didn’t renew Season 5 until May of last year. Amid the possible outcomes should the show be renewed, TVLine reports creator Lee Daniels is considering recasting the character of Jamal, rumored to be loosely based on himself (Daniels is also a gay black artist). Fox has not commented on the speculation, though it’s also not unprecedented for a network to recast a supporting character. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air famously swapped out Aunt Vivs just as Roseanne had two Beckys.

For now, Fox will continue to air episodes of Empire on Wednesday nights and has come out strong in support of Smollett. They issued their most recent statement in February, saying, “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”",2019-03-14 00:00:48+00:00,Inside Jussie Smollett’s Shocking ‘Empire’ Return: ‘It’s Kind of Been a Tough Week’,['Joseph Longo'],"['really', 'jamal', 'terms', 'smolletts', 'season', 'return', 'kind', 'smollett', 'saying', 'shocking', 'tough', 'probably', 'im', 'inside', 'episode', 'empire', 'jussie', 'week']",19
20,1,https://www.etonline.com/empire-returns-with-tearful-jussie-smollett-and-fans-on-twitter-have-some-strong-feelings-121456,"Empire returned for its Season 5 midseason premiere on Wednesday, marking the show's first new episode since the complex and shocking drama surrounding series star Jussie Smollett unfolded over the past six weeks.

While there has been a lot of speculation regarding Smollett's future on the show -- as Empire's own future is now shrouded in mystery and facing rumors of cancellation -- several episodes of the second half of Season 5 were already in the can when Smollett was allegedly involved in an attack on Jan. 29.

Meaning Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, also made his return to TV, in an emotional Spring premiere that saw Jamal break down in tears, give up on love and sing a hopeful new song (which, in the light of his legal troubles, now feels sadly ironic).

While Jamal doesn't have a whole lot of scenes in this drama-packed premiere, he does get some of the episode's most emotional scenes, and they all focus on his troubled relationship with fiance Kai Givens.

At the start of the episode, Kai chastises Jamal for still being loyal to his crime-prone and scandal-ridden family. Later, Kai is exposed to some of the Lyon family's favorite way of dealing with problems (when family patriarch Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard) hangs a man by his legs out a window and threatens to kill him), and asks Jamal to turn his back on his dad and come with him to London.

Jamal essentially tells Kai that he can't spend his life with someone who doesn't accept every part of him -- even his criminal tendencies -- and ends up giving Kai his engagement ring back. The men part, both openly weeping.

Video footage of kai gettin up out of town after seeing he ain’t about that Lyon life 🤣🤣🤣 #Empirepic.twitter.com/MDNilxdrjy — mack luvin 🗣💵💰🏃🏾‍♂️💨 (@swiggonmillion) March 14, 2019

The episode ends with Jamal somberly playing a tune on the piano and singing a song about heartbreak as the drama of the episodes' other various storylines play out, and it was an interesting choice to highlight Smollett's character in such a big way, considering reports that Fox was trying to tone down his involvement in episodes that had already been shot.

However, that wasn't the only song Jamal sang in the Spring premiere. During a performance at the Urban Arts High School, the musician performs a new song that he'd just written, and listening to the lyrics (while keeping Smollett's legal issues in mind) gave the song a weird vibe.

In what seemed like it was supposed to be a positive, hopeful moment for the character, Jamal sang an upbeat new song with lyrics that included, ""I'm probably going to have to fight/ but know it ain't nothing I can't handle/ Eventually I will be alright,"" and ""I'm coming, I'm shining, I'm going all the way to the top. Going all the way, yeah. I'm finally gonna give it everything I got, give it all or nothing.""

Also, ""What's your reaction when life's got you in a funk? Are you gonna stay down, or are you gonna get up? I hope you jump.""

Considering how Smollett has just indicted on 16 felony counts by a grand jury in Chicago -- for allegedly making false statements to police regarding being the victim of a hate crime, which he has staunchly denied -- the song has the sort of positive, motivational message the actor himself might benefit from listening to.

In fact, the scene even ends with Jamal telling the audience, ""I don't know if y'all been reading the blogs and all the foolishness, but it's kinda been a tough week."" Sure, Jamal was referring to some (absolutely bonkers) high-profile drama regarding his family, but that line is downright prescient.

Finally, let's quickly recap of an important ongoing aspect that has been developing through out season five: One of the biggest mysteries from the first half of the season revolved around brief flash forwards in time showing Lucious crying over a coffin. Fans have been speculating who, exactly, is in the coffin.

While the midseason finale in December and Wednesday night's premiere implied that it's the oldest Lyon son, Andre (Trai Byers), who ends up dying -- after being rushed to the hospital where it's suggested that he flatlines -- showrunner Brett Mahoney said in several interviews that the character in the coffin hasn't totally been decided upon.

While it seems like the show was angling toward Andre dying, misdirects are a staple of fun, soapy dramas like Empire. So it seems likely that they had another character in mind all along. Now, with Smollett's real-life drama casting a pall over the show, could Jamal be the one who ends up getting killed off?

Yes. Obviously. That's almost definitely going to happen, whether or not he's the one in the coffin.

Either way, Smollett's first episode back after the drama had a lot of fans watching and freaking out on Twitter, with many admitting that it was hard to watch Smollett play Jamal without thinking about his real-life legal troubles.

It still was the night’s second highest-rated show in primetime behind CBS’ Survivor (1.5 rating, 7.57M viewers), which also topped the night in viewers.

It was the first episode back for Empire since star Jussie Smollett was arrested and charged with lying about being the victim of an alleged attack in Chicago back in January. The return episode had been in the can for months, well before the alleged assault in the early-morning hours on January 29 and its aftermath.

Smollett was in court Thursday in Chicago and pleaded not guilty to 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct. His future on the series playing Jamal Lyon remains in question; Fox has not yet made a call on renewing it for Season 6.

Empire‘s numbers last night were the series’ lowest save for this past fall’s Halloween night episode, which saw a 1.2 rating and 4.2 million viewers. The fall finale episode December 5 did a 1.5 and 5.0 million viewers. Last season’s midseason return on March 28, 2018 notched a 2.0 rating and 6.2M sets of eyeballs.

Elsewhere in primetime Wednesday, Survivor was even in the demo and up a tick in viewers, leading in to the two-hour finale of The World’s Best (0.6, 3.72M), which saw a slight rise in audience for its season-ender but was flat in the demo.

ABC’s new Whiskey Cavalier (0.6, 3.73M) took a hit with no American Idol special s a lead-in this week, falling three-tenths at 10 PM where it was edged out by a Chicago PD repeat (NBC had an all-repeat lineup for the night). ABC’s comedy lineup was solid: the night’s second most-watched show The Goldbergs (1.1, 4.81M) was even, while Schooled (1.0, 3.94M), Modern Family (1.2, 4.60M) and Single Parents (0.8, 3.35M) grew by a tenth.

Fox’s also returned Star (1.1, 3.68M) from its winter break; it was down a tenth from its previous episode. That plus Empire did give the network’s the night’s overall demo win. CBS took viewers.

The CW’s Riverdale (0.3, 1.04M) and All American (0.2, 630,000), the later in its second-to-last episode of its freshman season, gained in viewers but were flat demo-wise.

Wearing a navy suit and dress coat, Smollett, 36, appeared serious and quiet standing next to his attorneys as Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to his case.

In a 16-count indictment returned by a grand jury last Thursday, Smollett, who is black, openly gay and plays a gay musician on Fox's hip-hop drama, was charged with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett was previously charged last month with felony disorderly conduct for making a false report after he told police he was attacked in January by masked supporters of President Donald Trump who beat him, slung a noose round his neck and poured a liquid chemical on him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Detectives investigated the incident as a hate crime but local news outlets cited police sources saying it was believed to be a hoax.

The Chicago Police Department is investigating how information about the alleged attack was leaked to journalists.

Fox cut Smollett's character in ""Empire"" after he was arrested.

According to prosecutors, Smollett wrote a $3,500 check to two brothers and gave them $100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps used in the supposed Jan. 29 attack.

Police said Smollett hoped the incident would advance his career and secure him a higher salary.

Police initially arrested the brothers on Feb. 13, after they were recognized from surveillance footage from near the scene of the alleged attack. One had appeared with Smollett on ""Empire,"" police and their lawyer said. Prosecutors said one had supplied Smollett with ""designer drugs"" in the past.

The brothers confessed to the plot, police said. They became cooperating witnesses and were released without charges.

After the alleged attack, Smollett received support on social media, including from celebrities and Democratic presidential candidates. Others were skeptical of the incident, which Smollett said occurred at around 2 a.m. on a city street during one of the coldest weeks in recent history.

Outside the courthouse on Thursday, about a dozen supporters gathered with signs, chanting that his prosecution was unjust.

In a ""Good Morning America"" interview last month, Smollett said he was angry some people questioned his story and suggested racial bias may be behind the disbelief. (Additional reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Writing by Suzannah Gonzales and Jonathan Allen; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

24,1,https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2019/03/14/ratings-tank-for-first-empire-since-jussie-smollett-arrest/23692305/,"“Empire” returned from winter hiatus on Wednesday, airing its first original episode since star Jussie Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report. It didn’t receive a warm welcome from viewers.

Last night’s 8 p.m. episode settled for a 1.3 demo rating/6 share among adults 18-49, and 4.412 million total viewers — those Nielsen numbers are way down from last year’s comparable hour, and are even down double digits versus the hip-hop soap opera’s fall finale.

The previous original “Empire” episode on Dec. 5 had a 1.5 rating and 5.043 million total viewers. Last year’s midseason return put up a 2.0 rating and tallied 6.217 million viewers.

We’ll save you the math: Wednesday’s hour was down 13 percent in both the demo and for the overall audience versus the fall finale, and down a heaping 35 percent in the demo and 29 percent in viewers from last year’s midseason premiere episode.

As a matter of fact, last night’s “Empire” drew the second-smallest audience and second-worst demo rating ever for “Empire.” The only episode to draw fewer “live” eyeballs (4.229 million) and a lower demo rating (a 1.2) aired on Halloween 2018, which makes sense, as people were celebrating the holiday and not in front of their TVs.

That said, Fox and its regular abbreviated (compared with CBS, ABC and NBC) primetime schedule still finished first in key-demo averages, but it just barely edged ABC — with a different of 17,000 viewers — for third in terms of total viewers. NBC aired all reruns last night and still landed a bigger audience than both of those nets.

Chicago authorities handed down 16 felony indictments last week and accused Smollett of staging a hate crime against himself.

Smollett claimed he was attacked in Chicago on January 29 by two white men who shouted ""This is MAGA country,"" tied a rope around his neck, and poured a substance on him. Two Nigerian men, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, were taken into police custody and later released without charge. Smollett was arrested on February 21 and accused of paying the two men to fake the attack.

While appearing in Cook County court on Thursday in Chicago, the 36-year-old Empire star pleaded not guilty to 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Earlier in the hearing, Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to the actor's case. Smollett, who is currently out on $100,000 bond, arrived to court with a group of people, donning a blue jacket and scarf with aviator sunglasses shielding his eyes.

This marks the latest development in a winding case that first began in late January when Smollett reported to police that he had been attacked in Chicago around 2 a.m.

""Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire,"" CPD Chief Spokesman Anthony Gugliemi told E! News at the time. ""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.

Smollett was indicted last week after Cook County prosecutors alleged he’d staged a fake attack on himself. He was arrested back in February after his initial charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, but has since been released on bail.

Smollett continues to claim that the attack was a legitimately racist, homophobic act on the part of two unknown masked men. Smollett told police that the two men attacked him at around 2am on January 29, tying a noose around his neck and shouting bigoted slurs. Smollett has since been interviewed on Good Morning America, and issued a statement in an attempt to maintain the legitimacy of the attack.

Through video evidence, Cook County prosecutors believe they have identified a different timeline of the night’s events, claiming that Smollett actually paid the two assailants for the rope, masks, bleach, and worked out all the details ahead of time in an effort to make the attack seem like a hate crime.

The plea comes less than one week after a Chicago grand jury indicted the embattled actor on 16 felony counts in relation to the actor’s alleged staging of a hate crime against himself in January. Smollett is next scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday, April 17.

Smollett reportedly told police that two men approached him and began hurling racist and homophobic slurs at him. According to the original account, the two men beat Smollett, placed a noose around his neck and doused him with a chemical substance (believed to be bleach), then fled. Smollett also told police that the assailants “yelled pro-‘Make America Great Again’ [MAGA] comments” during the attack.

Later developments cast doubt on Smollett’s account, including the questioning of two suspects — a pair of Nigerian brothers, one of whom worked as a personal trainer on a music video of Smollett’s — who were later released without being charged. Smollett’s lawyers have insisted that the actor played no role in his attack.

He was charged in February with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He was arrested on Feb. 21; in the press conference that followed, Chicago Police alleged that Smollett staged the attack in order to gain a larger salary at the Fox drama.

The 36-year-old “Empire” star walked confidently into the Leighton Criminal Court Building in Chicago, where Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to preside over the attention-grabbing case. He wore aviator sunglasses and a blue suit, and kept his head held high. He was accompanied by attorney Tina Glandian and an entourage.

Glandian entered the plea on his behalf. Smollett’s next court date was scheduled for April 17, according to the Associated Press.

Smollett will be allowed to travel to New York and Los Angeles, where his attorneys are based, without asking court permission, but he must notify pre-trial services before leaving the state, CBS Chicago reported. L.A.-based celebrity attorney Mark Geragos joined Smollett’s legal team in recent weeks.

Smollett was indicted on Friday by a Cook County grand jury in relation to a Jan. 29 incident that law enforcement officials believe the “Empire” actor orchestrated because he was dissatisfied with his pay on the Fox series and to advance his career.

Smollett has denied staging the alleged attack in Streeterville, and he made a surprise appearance at a court hearing on Tuesday “to show confidence in his innocence,” his representative told NBC News. A judge at that hearing ruled that cameras would be allowed in the courtroom on Thursday.

In January, the actor, who is black and gay, told police that he was the victim of a racial and homophobic hate crime. He said that two men hurled slurs at him, beat him up, threw bleach on him and put a noose around his neck.

As his story went viral, Smollett appeared to ride the wave of attention during a sold-out Los Angeles concert and a now-infamous interview with “Good Morning America’s” Robin Roberts.

But his narrative has been repeatedly called into question, and the investigation abruptly shifted last month following testimony from two brothers who became persons of interest in the case.

Smollett surrendered to authorities on Feb. 21 after the brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who said they were hired by Smollett to carry out the attack, provided Chicago Police with evidence and testimony that investigators said implicated the actor. The Nigerian American brothers have said they have “tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation.” They do not face any charges.

Prosecutors initially charged Smollett with a single felony count at the time and he was released from Cook County Jail after a friend posted a $100,000 bond.

Cook County State’s Atty. Kim Foxx has recused herself from the case and has asked for it to be turned over to the FBI, according to local reports.

“Empire” returned for its midseason premiere on Wednesday, debuting the first of Season 5’s nine remaining episodes. Smollett will still feature in seven of them but was written off of the final two episodes due to his case.

CBS Chicago reports:

After Smollett pleaded not guilty, Cook County Judge Steven Watkins granted him permission to travel to New York and California to consult with his attorneys, if he provides 48 hours notice to the court’s pretrial services office. Smollett is free on bail, and Watkins admonished the actor to be present an on-time for all of his upcoming court dates.

Meanwhile, Smollett’s lawyer Mark Geragos has been on the media circuit proclaiming his client’s innocence. Last week, he told Anderson Cooper, without any sense of irony, that the actor is a victim of a “media gang bang.”

“What is happening here is, frankly, a media gang bang of this guy of unprecedented proportions,” Geragos said.

“This is an outrage,” he continued. “I defy anybody to find any indictment anywhere where somebody has brought 16 counts for being a victim of a hate crime, basically.”

The producers of Empire have already deleted Smollett’s scenes from the remainder of the season, and rumors abound that his role will be recast. Should a jury convict him, the actor will also face lengthy jail time for his crime.

Smollett’s next court hearing is scheduled for April 17.

The actor will be due back in court next month, on April 17th.

Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts by a Cook County grand jury on March 8th, and also charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, with the indictment stemming from that initial charge. In their decision, two separate sets of charges were handed down by the grand jury.

The first set of charges related to the specifics of the story Smollett initially told police about the attack. The second set of charges are related to the follow-up interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that same day.

The new set of charges carry a sentencing range of probabation to four years in prison, though most prosecution and defense experts have said since his arrest that Smollett will most likely cut a plea deal and avoid prison time.

In late January 2019, Smollett alleged that he had been physically assaulted in Chicago, a victim of what was thought of at the time as a “hate crime” by Chicago Police. He claimed that the two men who attacked him also yelled racist and homophobic slurs, while placing a rope around Smollett’s neck and throwing a liquid substance on him.

Originally picked up by Chicago PD on February 13 and questioned for 48 hours as “persons of interest” in the alleged attack, siblings Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo ended up cooperating with law enforcement. Both brothers have been extras on the FOX series in the past, and a personal trainer to Smollett.

Shortly after the “assault,” ABC’s Good Morning America aired an interview with Smollett where the actor/singer went into detail about the assualt and what life has been like for him since that time. Speaking with interviewer / GMA co-host Robin Roberts, Smollett had this to say when asked about allegation being made that the attack was a hoax:

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country.”

Though Smollett’s character Jamal Lyon was written out of the final two season episodes of FOX‘s long-running and popular prime-time drama Empire, the actor was present this week in “My Fault Is Past” (an episode filmed prior) when the series returned from hiatus.

Smollett's case was assigned to a trial judge, Judge Steven Watkins, before the actor's lawyer Tina Glandian entered not guilty pleas on his behalf to the 16 counts.

The 36-year-old actor arrived at the courthouse shortly before 9 a.m., the station reports, greeted by a handful of supporters holding signs reading ""I Stand With Jussie"" and ""I Believe Jussie Smollett,"" reports CBS Chicago.

Jussie Smollett indicted on 16 felony counts by grand jury

Smollett said ""not guilty"" as his lawyer entered the plea. When Watkins warned him to show up on time for each future court hearing or risk jail time, Smollett replied, ""Yes, your honor.""

Watkins granted Smollett's request to be allowed to leave the state meet with his lawyers in New York and California, but said the actor must give the court at least 48 hours' prior notice. The next court date was scheduled for April 17.

Cameras were allowed in the courtroom Thursday, though there was no live feed of the proceedings. Smollett's attorneys have said they welcome cameras in court, as a counter to ""misinformation"" they claim has been leaked to the media since he reported being attacked on a Chicago street in January.

Brothers in Jussie Smollett incident ""put their trust in the wrong person,"" lawyer says

Police and prosecutors have said that Smollett hired two brothers to stage the attack. Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed his alleged attackers used racial and homophobic slurs, hung a rope around his neck and tossed bleach on him before fleeing.

Smollett maintains his innocence. His attorneys say they want the public to see the evidence, or lack thereof, in the case.

33,1,https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/03/jussie-smollett-pleads-not-guilty-to-all-charges-now-what/,"Jussie Smollett made a pair of returns this week.

First, the actor appeared on Empire Wednesday night for the first time since he was arrested and charged with multiple felonies.

(The Fox drama had been on hiatus since December 5 and Smollett claimed he got attacked on January 29.)

Social media blew up during the installment, with fans in near universal agreement that they couldn't really concentrate on any storyline when one of the show's leads was strongly suspected of orchestrating an assault against himself.

And then blaming in on white racist homophobes.

And lying repeatedly about it at every turn.

""Good Lord, SO much has happened since [Empire] was on the last time...I think we ALL know what that is!!!!"" wrote one viewer on Twitter, while another simply added a series of emojis hinting at the Smollett-sized elephant in the room.

""When Cookie asked if Jamal forgot his last name was Lyon....that script didnt age well,"" another loyal fan remarked.

At this point, of course, the real drama surrounding Smollett takes place off screen.

During a brief hearing before Cook County Circuit Judge Steven Watkins on Thursday morning, the controversial heard the indictment filed against him and agreed to be in court for every hearing moving forward.

Last week, a grand jury handed down a total of 16 indictments against Smollett, all stemming from the purported attack against him in Chicago about seven weeks ago.

He has been charged with disorderly conduct and making a false police report.

In court today, Smollett pleaded not guilty across the board.

Smollett is accused of lying to the authorities and making up a story that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two men in the early morning hours of January 29 in Chicago.

Cops have since said that Smollett concocted this tale to further his career, although it remains unclear just how he thought this would accomplish such a goal.

The two Nigerian brothers who allegedly schemed along with Smollett have reportedly spilled all their tea to the police, implicating Jussie and explaining how he paid them to pose as his attackers.

No matter how many times we write about this story, it never stops being literally incredible.

Each charge against Smollett is punishable by as little as probation and as much as three years behind bars.

He's due back in court on April 17.

As noted above, there's a lot riding on this for Smollett aside from his acting career.

But Fox is yet to renew Empire for a sixth season.

In the past, with the exception of last year when a renewal announcement was made in May, the network had always given the green light for future episodes in January.

Despite earlier reports, Smollett has not technically been fired from the series, but he has been removed from the final few installments scheduled for this spring.

Executives may be waiting to see how his legal case plays out before deciding on the program's fate, but time would not be on their side if this really is the play.

Smollett could agree to a plea deal or he could take this all the way to a trial; the latter likely would not be held for several months, meaning Fox has to make some sort of decision soon.

And, let's be honest, right?

No matter what happens with Smollett legally, is there any way he can be brought back at this point?

I’m the sucker who’s still holding out hope that a tape of some actual racist homophobes whooping on Jussie’s ass will miraculously fall out of some Chicago PD officer’s pocket in front of a TMZ camera or something. Look, I said I was a sucker.

A Chicago grand jury was not fucking around when they indicted Jussie. They threw the motherfucking book at him, and while it was flying at his head, every single page reached out and gave him a paper cut. Though he was originally charged with one breezy sounding felony disorderly conduct charge, he’s now facing 16 counts for allegedly lying to the police. That’s one count for each individual lie he allegedly told over the course of 2 interviews with police. According to NPR, “each count carries a possible penalty of up to three years in prison”, which would be 48 years. According to The Hollywood Reporter, his legal team called the charges “redundant and vindictive”, or in layman’s terms, petty as hell.

Here’s Jussie walking into the courtroom looking like he’s in a Muslim Brotherhood simulation in The Matrix .

36,1,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/jussie-smollett-update-not-guilty-plea,"On Wednesday night, Jussie Smollett returned to Fox viewers’ screens as Empire’s fifth season returned from its midseason hiatus. And his character had some seriously ironic dialogue. At one point, Jamal Lyon seemed to channel the actor who plays him: “I don’t know if y’all been reading the blogs and all the foolishness, but it’s kinda been a tough week.” Smollett himself would likely concur—because on Thursday morning, he appeared in court in Chicago, where he entered a “not guilty” plea to the 16 felony disorderly conduct charges leveled against him earlier this month.

In late January, the actor was hospitalized after what he claimed to be a homophobic, racist attack. Weeks later, the actor called for “justice” in his first interview following the incident, and addressed already-budding rumors that the whole thing had been staged. “At first it was a thing of like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it—’cause it’s the truth!’” Smollett told Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts.“ . . . Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth; you don’t even want to see the truth.’” Days later, however, police officially accused Smollett of staging the attack in a fiery address, calling him “troubled,” and claiming he had deceived the public in an attempt to get a salary bump on Empire. Smollett was subsequently arrested and, hours later, charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report before, weeks later, receiving 16 further charges.

Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the unfolding mess, insisting that the attack was not staged. In a statement to V.F. following the news of Smollett’s second round of charges, his attorney, Mark Geragos, wrote, “The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines, in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department, and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence, even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Fox, meanwhile, has written Smollett’s Empire character out of the final two episodes of the drama’s fifth season. In a joint statement in February, producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo, and Dennis Hammer responded to Smollett’s arrest by saying, “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Smollett is expected back in court April 17, Deadline reports. He is currently out on $100,000 bail, and he “could face more than three years behind bars and a $25,000 fine on each count of misrepresentation to cops and detectives,” according to Deadline.

Smollett has pleaded his innocence after facing 16 charges for allegedly falsely reporting a hate crime assault. He told police in late January that he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2am.

The actor said the men shouted racist and homophobic abuse at him, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him.

Following an investigation,Chicago Police superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on Empire.

Smollett’s lawyer has called the charges “redundant and vindictive” and a “desperate attempt to make headlines”. He added: “Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.

Empire returned for its midseason premiere on Wednesday, 13 March, airing the first of season five’s final nine episodes.

Smollett has been written out of the season’s final two episodes, although he will appear in the seven that were filmed before the incident occurred.

“It’s been an emotional rollercoaster,” Mahoney said of the allegations. “You have someone in your family who’s going through this, while at the same time, we’re shooting the final episodes of the season, which are also just heightened emotionally.

“So it was a lot to deal with and a lot to go through, but we’re really just focused on finishing strong. We’re in our last week of production and I’m really proud of the work we’ve done this season, and hopefully the fans will really engage with these back nine episodes.”",2019-03-14 08:08:20+00:00,Jussie Smollett: Empire producer says it's 'too early' to talk about actor's future on show,['Clarisse Loughrey'],"['future', 'indian', 'actors', '2019', 'day', 'minister', 'epa', 'president', 'early', 'state', 'protest', 'smollett', 'ap', 'producer', 'afpgetty', 'talk', 'empire', 'jussie']",37
38,1,https://www.advocate.com/news/2019/3/14/jussie-smollett-pleads-not-guilty-charges-lying-police,"Jussie Smollett entered into a not-guilty plea on Thursday morning in regards to charges of disorderly conduct and lying to police after filing reports stating he was the victim of a January hate crime incident.

His plea comes just a week after a grand jury indicted the actor on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct related to this incident.

The actor will now battle these charges in court over the next few months, and will be allowed to travel between New York City and Los Angeles where his lawyers are based without permission of the court.

Smollett, who was arrested February 20 by Chicago police, has been unwavering in his innocence even as public opinion has swayed from support of the actor to abandonment. And his lawyers have only dug their heels in as the case continues, with the local authorities confident that he will be found guilty.

""What is unexpected however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie,"" said Smollett's lawyers after being indicted and reports of an internal police investigation were announced relating to potential false leaks from the department in the case.

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records,"" the lawyers continued.

The Empire star — who came out on Ellen DeGeneres’s talk show in 2015 — told police that he was stopped around 2 a.m. on January 29 in downtown Chicago by two men wearing ski masks and yelling racial and homophobic slurs. The individuals then reportedly placed a noose around Smollett’s neck, punched him, and poured an unknown substance on his body.

""This is MAGA country,"" the men then yelled, according to interviews conducted by the Chicago police with the actor. Smollett’s manager has told police he heard this language among racial and homophobic slurs.

A video of Smollett with a rope around his neck returning to his building after the reported incident has been recovered by the police but has yet to be released. Local police say they will not release this footage until the investigation ins finished.

The actor soon after told Good Morning America that he stands by his story and was frustrated at criticism that he was lying. Smollett also said the men in a blurry photo released by police were the people who attacked him. However, police identified the subjects of the video as the two brothers, Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, who are friends with Smollett and even serve as personal trainers to the actor.

These men were able to produce evidence that ""changed the trajectory"" of the case, and led to police filing charges against Smollett.

At an explosive press briefing in February, Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson said authorities believe Smollett faked a threatening letter and then a hate crime against himself because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"" on the Fox musical drama.

Johnson outlined how police believe Smollett hired two brothers to stage an attack for $3,500. The brothers, wearing gloves, punched Smollett ""a little bit,"" Johnson said, but police believe that the scratches on Smollett's face were self-inflicted.

Johnson, who is African-American, declared that Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career. I'm left hanging my head and asking why.""",2019-03-14 00:00:00,Jussie Smollett Pleads Not Guilty to Charges of Lying to Police,[],"['chicago', 'smolletts', 'charges', 'men', 'lying', 'brothers', 'actor', 'smollett', 'investigation', 'told', 'pleads', 'lawyers', 'jussie', 'guilty']",38

Wearing a navy suit and dress coat, Smollett, 36, appeared serious and quiet standing next to his attorneys as Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to his case.

In a 16-count indictment returned by a grand jury last Thursday, Smollett, who is black, openly gay and plays a gay musician on Fox’s hip-hop drama, was charged with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett was previously charged last month with felony disorderly conduct for making a false report after he told police he was attacked in January by masked supporters of President Donald Trump who beat him, slung a noose round his neck and poured a liquid chemical on him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Detectives investigated the incident as a hate crime but local news outlets cited police sources saying it was believed to be a hoax.

The Chicago Police Department is investigating how information about the alleged attack was leaked to journalists.

Fox cut Smollett’s character in “Empire” after he was arrested.

According to prosecutors, Smollett wrote a $3,500 check to two brothers and gave them $100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps used in the supposed Jan. 29 attack.

ADVERTISEMENT

Police said Smollett hoped the incident would advance his career and secure him a higher salary.

Police initially arrested the brothers on Feb. 13, after they were recognized from surveillance footage from near the scene of the alleged attack. One had appeared with Smollett on “Empire,” police and their lawyer said. Prosecutors said one had supplied Smollett with “designer drugs” in the past.

The brothers confessed to the plot, police said. They became cooperating witnesses and were released without charges.

After the alleged attack, Smollett received support on social media, including from celebrities and Democratic presidential candidates. Others were skeptical of the incident, which Smollett said occurred at around 2 a.m. on a city street during one of the coldest weeks in recent history.

Outside the courthouse on Thursday, about a dozen supporters gathered with signs, chanting that his prosecution was unjust.

In a “Good Morning America” interview last month, Smollett said he was angry some people questioned his story and suggested racial bias may be behind the disbelief.

Smollett has denied staging the attack and maintains his innocence. The actor is free on bond.

Wearing a navy suit and dress coat, Smollett, 36, appeared serious and quiet standing next to his attorneys as Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to his case during Thursday’s hearing.

About a dozen supporters had gathered with signs outside the courthouse, chanting that his prosecution was unjust.

The prosecution has alleged that the actor orchestrated the assault because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

A grand jury in Chicago previously indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts, which his attorneys have called “prosecutorial overkill”.

According to prosecutors, Smollett wrote a $3,500 check to two brothers and gave them $100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps used in the supposed 29 January attack.

Police initially arrested the brothers on 13 February, after they were recognised from surveillance footage from near the scene of the alleged attack. One had appeared with Smollett on Empire, police and their lawyer said. Prosecutors allege that one had supplied Smollett with “designer drugs” in the past.

According to authorities, the brothers confessed to the plot. They became cooperating witnesses and were released without charges.

Yeah, I assumed camera flashes as well, but I also remember Victoria Beckham saying that a security guard of hers told her to always wear sunglasses in public because if you look a potential stalker directly in the eye, that can encourage them and make them worse, so if you wear sunglasses all the time nobody knows where you're looking.



I think about that a lot every single time I see a female celebrity with dark sunglasses on. Reply

Just kidding - I know why.

Jacob Wohl appears to have faked death threats against himself and submitted them to police as evidence that he was facing “terroristic threats,” according to recently released documents https://t.co/p4tuvQdwwp — The Daily Beast (@thedailybeast) March 14, 2019

Besides the obvious reason, if you're honest with yourself, there really isn't much comparison. An actor on a popular tv show vs a nobody idiot that only people on Twitter really know about. Plus Jussie went and got the FBI involved as might go down for mail fraud. Dumbass Jacob made a report to the Minneapolis PD that they themselves didn't even take seriously or do anything about.

Jussie didn't ""go and get the FBI involved"" either. He made a report to the local PD. The FBI gets involved only if they are asked to by local police forces, usually because there's a possibility of a federal crime (as opposed to just a state one).



Wohl is all over the news right now due to his new documentary trying to prove that Congresswoman Ilhan Omar married her own brother to get him into the country. He may not be an entertainment celebrity, but he's certainly well-known enough that if he was a liberal, FOX News would be trumpeting the story of him faking death threats 24/7. Reply

I live in Minneapolis so I take special offense to this kid’s antics. It’s funny because the DM he sent himself as the diversity coordinator said “GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY CITY” and I tweeted exactly that to him when he first came here. I’m sure plenty of others did too but I like to pretend that mine was the inspirado.



That whole group is so transparently out for money and they are such bad liars. Ali was especially cringeworthy, telling people on his livestream that he needed “money, money, money, money, money, and prayer.” They kept saying they needed funds for a security team who’s juuuuust out of the camera frame, but no we can’t show them to you because it would compromise our safety. Bitch from whomst?! Nobody in real life knows or cares who the fuck you are! The only person who did recognize them took a video which showed that only one other person was with them, their cameraman. So the next day these jerkwads post a photo with their ✌🏻security team✌🏻 to shut people up but it’s just a couple chubby dudes with their faces blurred out and one of them’s wearing crocs in the fucking snow. I mean come the fuck on!

- Then a relative of Smollett then started texting Foxx, “Omg this would be a huge victory.” (This is in regards to the FBI investigating the case)

42,1,https://dailycaller.com/2019/03/14/jussie-smollett-arraignment-court/,"Disgraced “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was back in court Thursday morning and pleaded “not guilty” to 16 counts of disorderly conduct after conducting a hate crime hoax against himself.

Smollett is required to be at every court date, and his next appearance is scheduled for mid-April, according to TMZ. Smollett is allowed to leave Chicago to go to Los Angeles and New York City for meetings with lawyers. He is expected to notify the court before leaving Chicago and upon returning.

Jussie Smollett is back in court. He is expected to enter his plea and a judge will be assigned to the case. Cameras will be inside the court room. @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/DUhykavG5R — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) March 14, 2019

Smollett was charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct on Mar. 7 after he allegedly lied to the police about being attacked by Trump supporters. The grand jury returned two sets of charges for the two separate interviews Smollett had with Chicago police. Each false statement received its own individual charge. (RELATED: Jussie Smollett Indicted On 16 Felony Charges)

Smollett’s lawyer called the charges “overkill,” according to TMZ.

Smollett pleaded “not guilty” to the first disorderly conduct charge back in February and was released from jail on $100,000 bond.

But Smollett’s personal fate isn’t the only thing up in the air right now. Production sources from “Empire” told TMZ that Fox has not renewed “Empire” for another season, which is largely due to Smollett’s case.

Smollett’s character has already been removed from the last two episodes of season five. His character is going to be out of the country.",2019-03-14 00:00:00,Jussie Smollett Pleads Not Guilty To 16-Count Indictment,['Lauryn Overhultz'],"['16count', 'conduct', 'season', 'chicago', 'smolletts', 'disorderly', 'tmz', 'indictment', '16', 'smollett', 'court', 'pleads', 'empire', 'jussie', 'guilty']",44
43,1,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/03/14/revolution-jussie-smolletts-trial-will-televised/,"Judging by the web traffic and the number of cable news segments on the subject, much of the public simply can’t get enough of these Jussie Smollett stories. What looked to me like a simple case of a B-list (at best) actor faking a racist attack to boost his career has somehow turned into a larger statement about society or something. Well, if you’re in that category, fear not. You’ll be getting all of the Smollett goodness you can handle. A judge in Chicago has now ruled that cameras will be allowed in the courtroom for Jussie’s trial, and the request to allow this came from the defendant himself. (CBS Chicago)

Thanks to a ruling from a judge, everyone will be able to see “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett in court facing criminal charges. Smollett did not need to be in court for Tuesday’s hearing, but he chose to be there standing before the judge with his legal team in what several defense attorneys not connected to the case referred to as a routine hearing. The hearing comes after a grand jury indicted the actor on 16 counts last week, accusing him of falsifying a police report and lying to police. Once inside, Smollett quietly led a team of family, friends and attorneys through the courthouse.

What’s going on here seems fairly obvious, and if Smollett’s legal team didn’t think it would be helpful to him they probably wouldn’t have gone along with it. We already have one example that was on display during yesterday’s hearing. There was no need for Jussie Smollett to even be in court for that hearing. It was just some pro forma motions that needed to be put into the record and Smollett’s attorneys could have wrapped it up with the judge and the prosecutors in a matter of minutes.

But that’s not what happened. Smollett showed up anyway, trailed by a group of supporters, posing for pictures and offering quotes as he made his way in and out of the brief hearing. In other words, with the state looking very confident about the evidence they have and anticipating a conviction, Smollett is trying to turn this into a dog and pony show to win the battle in the court of public opinion. If he can generate some public sympathy for his cause and make himself out to be the victim of a massive, racist legal system, this entire affair could actually wind up helping his career rather than hurting it.

And what does he really have to lose? All the talk of him winding up getting years behind bars strikes me as doubtful at best. This could still wind up going to a plea deal where he walks away with a fine, time served and some community service. Even if he does wind up serving some time, he’s probably betting that it would only serve to expand his legend. But he’s already massively more famous (or is it infamous?) than he was before this freak show of a hoax kicked off. So why wouldn’t he want cameras in the courtroom to capture every moment of it? Remember… this guy is a trained actor. When the cameras are rolling, he knows how to play it for the best effect.

Enjoy the show, folks. As for me, I’ll confess that I’ll probably watch because that’s my job. But I’m not expecting any sort of classic courtroom drama to emerge.",2019-03-14 00:00:00,The revolution (and Jussie Smollett’s trial) will be televised,"['Jazz Shaw', 'Ed Morrissey', 'Karen Townsend', 'John Sexton']","['hearing', 'smolletts', 'wind', 'team', 'judge', 'actor', 'televised', 'smollett', 'court', 'revolution', 'trial', 'probably', 'public', 'legal', 'jussie']",45

Senate lawmakers face a key vote Thursday: whether to uphold or reject President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency to build his proposed border wall. Trump made the move in February to free up billions of dollars for the wall, with most of the money coming from the Pentagon. Four Senate Republicans say they will side with Democrats to support a resolution to rescind it, making a defeat nearly certain. Because the House has already approved the resolution against the emergency, the measure's OK the Senate would send the matter to the president's desk. But Trump could sign the first veto of his administration, and it's unlikely House Democrats would be able to garner enough GOP support to override it. Win or lose, the vote will be a test of Trump's power.

O'Rourke announces White House run

After months of intense speculation, Beto O'Rourke announced that he's running for president in 2020 on Thursday. O'Rourke, a Texas Democrat who was narrowly defeated by Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterms, is viewed by some Dems as a ""young rock star."" In a December Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, 11 percent of likely Democratic caucus-goers said O'Rourke, 46, was their first choice for president — putting him behind only former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The former congressman told Oprah Winfrey last month that his decision to run for the White House will come down to his family: his wife Amy and his three children, Ulysses, Molly and Henry.

Jussie Smollett to appear at court hearing

Jussie Smollett, the 'Empire' actor accused by Chicago police of staging a fake hate crime for personal profit, is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday on 16 felony charges. On Jan. 29, Smollett claimed he was attacked in the middle of the night on a downtown street by masked men shouting homophobic and racist abuse. Police alleged he had paid two friends more than $3,000 to stage the attack as a ploy to boost his profile and get a raise in salary. He was later charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct stemming from the alleged false police report. In a hearing Tuesday, Smollett's legal team said they ""welcome"" cameras in the courtroom ""so (the public) can see evidence and lack thereof"" as prosecutors present their case.

Tesla to unveil new Model Y SUV

Tesla founder Elon Musk on Thursday will unveil the all-electric car maker's next vehicle — the Model Y compact SUV — at an event in Los Angeles. Musk tweeted that the Model Y will be about 10 percent larger than the Model 3 sedan and will ""cost about 10 percent more & have slightly less range for same battery."" With Model 3 orders often selling for more than $50,000, that could put a typical Model Y in the $55,000 range. It will share the same platform as the Model 3 to save costs and will feature normal doors – not the falcon-wing doors of the Model X SUV, Musk tweeted. Here's what this Model 3 owner says about whether her yearning has been fulfilled.

""Winds will rival what's seen in a Category 1 hurricane,"" said weathermodels.com meteorologist Ryan Maue. The worst weather is forecast for the Plains, from Texas up to the Dakotas, with AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski warning of a ""major blizzard"" that will produce ""massive drifts."" On Wednesday, Dallas was hit by a 78-mph wind gust, and Pueblo, Colorado, unofficially recorded its lowest air pressure ever. The storm system is officially classed as a bomb cyclone, caused by a rapid, steep pressure drop over 24 hours.

45,1,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/03/14/jussie-smollett-absent-from-empire-tv-promo-after-hoax-attack/,"A promotional video for the Fox series Empire posted online is notably missing one of its stars, the now-indicted felon Jussie Smollett.

In a video posted to the official Empire YouTube channel on March 13, a new episode is teased, but Smollett is nowhere to be found — sans a split second out-of-focus shot.



The star’s absence comes after he was arrested last month for staging an attack against himself, according to Chicago Police.

In January, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two masked men who beat him, put a rope around his neck, dumped a chemical on him, and yelled “This is MAGA country!” He also claimed that the men called him racist, homophobic slurs.

Chicago police announced in February that they believe he planned the attack himself and lied about it. According to police, he led authorities to believe that his attackers were white when in fact his attackers were Nigerian-American men who he allegedly paid to attack him.

He surrendered to police and was arrested.

The latest episode of Empire suffered a serious ratings drop.

According to TheWrap:

As a matter of fact, last night’s “Empire” drew the second-smallest audience and second-worst demo rating ever for “Empire.” The only episode to draw fewer “live” eyeballs (4.229 million) and a lower demo rating (a 1.2) aired on Halloween 2018, which makes sense, as people were out celebrating and not in front of their TVs.

However, in a statement after his arrest, Fox maintained that he was “not being written out of the show.”",2019-03-14 00:00:00,Jussie Smollett Absent from ‘Empire’ TV Promo After Hoax Attack,['Justin Caruso'],"['fox', 'posted', 'stars', 'attack', 'men', 'promo', 'smollett', 'absent', 'rating', 'video', 'hoax', 'empire', 'jussie', 'episode', 'tv']",47

The Empire actor's lawyer Tina Glandian entered the plea on Smollett's behalf.

Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to oversee the case shortly after Smollett arrived at the Cook County courthouse on Thursday morning. The arraignment hearing then began at 10 a.m., which is when Smollett's plea was submitted. The 36-year-old actor is set to appear in court on April 17.

Smollett was initially charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct, stemming from accusations that he falsified a police report and lied to authorities about the events that took place on Jan. 29. He pleaded not guilty to the first felony charge from Feb. 20, however, a grand jury then indicted the Empire star for more than a dozen felony counts on March 8.

News reports have suggested that the actor may have staged the attack because he was unsatisfied with his pay on the Fox series Empire, and/or because he wanted to attract more publicity. Smollett is currently out on $100,000 bail and he could face up to three years in prison, and a $25,000 fine for each of the counts he's currently charged with.

The actor claimed that he was the victim of a racist, homophobic hate crime in Chicago after two men allegedly beat him, put a rope around his neck, and poured bleach on his face. On Feb. 13, Chicago police arrested brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo for their connection to the attack. Following their release two days later, reports began suggesting that Smollett may have orchestrated the entire thing.

Sources close to the brothers then told CBS that they believe Smollett staged the attack after the threatening letter he allegedly sent to himself on the set of Empire didn't draw enough media attention.

CHICAGO (AP) — ‘‘Empire’’ actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges accusing him of lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in downtown Chicago a few weeks ago.

Smollett, who left the courthouse without speaking to reporters, is charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show, hired two friends to help him stage the attack on him in downtown Chicago early on the morning of Jan. 29. They say Smollett was unhappy about his salary and wanted to drum up publicity to help his career.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack and maintains he is innocent. His attorneys have called the charges against him ‘‘prosecutorial overkill.’’

There were several supporters outside the courthouse doors as Smollett arrived for the hearing, including some who waved signs. Activist Wisdom Cole led a few chants in support of the actor, the black community and the LGBT community.

‘‘Jussie has been a person of high caliber and character. He comes from an activist family. He has a consistent track record and history of supporting marginalized people ... and so his track record is not on par with the idea of a hoax,’’ she said.

Wearing a navy suit and dress coat, Smollett, 36, appeared serious and quiet standing next to his attorneys as Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to his case.

“Yes, sir,” Smollett said in a soft voice as the judge instructed him that he would next return to court on April 12. Some of his relatives sat in the court’s overflow gallery near a handful of fans, some wearing “Empire” shirts.

In an indictment returned by a grand jury last Thursday, Smollett, who is black, openly gay and plays a gay musician on Fox’s hip-hop drama, was charged with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett and his lawyers declined to comment as they left the courthouse.

Smollett was previously charged last month with felony disorderly conduct for making a false report after he told police he was attacked in January by masked supporters of President Donald Trump who beat him, slung a noose round his neck and poured a liquid chemical on him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Detectives investigated the incident as a hate crime but local news outlets cited police sources saying it was believed to be a hoax.

Fox cut Smollett’s character in “Empire” after he was arrested.

According to prosecutors, Smollett wrote a $3,500 check to two brothers and gave them $100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps used in the supposed Jan. 29 attack.

Police said Smollett hoped the incident would advance his career and secure him a higher salary.

Police initially arrested the brothers on Feb. 13, after they were recognized from surveillance footage from near the scene of the alleged attack. One had appeared with Smollett on “Empire,” police and their lawyer said. Prosecutors said one had supplied Smollett with “designer drugs” in the past.

The brothers confessed to the plot, police said. They became cooperating witnesses and were released without charges.

After the alleged attack, Smollett received support on social media, including from celebrities and Democratic presidential candidates. Others were skeptical of the incident, which Smollett said occurred at around 2 a.m. on a city street during one of the coldest weeks in recent history.

Outside the courthouse on Thursday, about a dozen supporters gathered with signs, chanting that his prosecution was unjust.

Jussie Smollett Pleads Not Guilty To 16 Felony Charges For Alleged Attack ‘Empire’ star is accused of staging a racist and homophobic assault.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to 16 felony charges for allegedly staging a hate attack, RadarOnline.com can report.

The 36-year-old actor reportedly entered Chicago court on March 14. This comes on the heels of the 16-count indictment a grand jury filed against him on March 8.

The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office previously confirmed to Radar that Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. The indictment, however, charged him with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

As Radar readers know, Smollett was hospitalized on January 29 after claiming he was attacked in a Chicago alley at 2 a.m. by two men.

The actor claimed the attack was of racist and homophobic nature. The two attackers were later identified as brothers Olabinjo “Ola” and Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo. One of the brothers reportedly worked on the set of Empire as an extra.

Chicago investigators working on the case accused Smollett of paying the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack.

Smollett is reportedly allowed to travel to Los Angeles and New York to meet with his lawyers as long as he notifies the court 48 hours in advance of his travel plans.

The television star was axed from the final two episodes of Empire just one day after he was arrested for a felony in February.

Police said Smollett hoped the incident would advance his career and secure him a higher salary.

One had appeared with Smollett on ""Empire,"" police and their lawyer said. Prosecutors said one had supplied Smollett with ""designer drugs"" in the past.

The brothers confessed to the plot, police said. They became cooperating witnesses and were released without charges.

After the alleged attack, Smollett received support on social media, including from celebrities and Democratic presidential candidates. Others were skeptical of the incident, which Smollett said occurred at around 2 a.m. on a city street during one of the coldest weeks in recent history.

Outside the courthouse on Thursday, about a dozen supporters gathered with signs, chanting that his prosecution was unjust.

In a ""Good Morning America"" interview last month, Smollett said he was angry some people questioned his story and suggested racial bias may be behind the disbelief.

59,1,https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/celebrities/111296736/empire-actor-jussie-smollett-pleads-not-guilty-at-hearing,"CHICAGO - ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty in a Chicago court on Thursday to new charges that he falsely reported to police that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic assault on a city street.

Wearing a navy suit and dress coat, Smollett, 36, appeared serious and quiet standing next to his attorneys as Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to his case.

In a 16-count indictment returned by a grand jury last Thursday, Smollett, who is black, openly gay and plays a gay musician on Fox's hip-hop drama, was charged with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators.



Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett was previously charged last month with felony disorderly conduct for making a false report after he told police he was attacked in January by masked supporters of President Donald Trump who beat him, slung a noose round his neck and poured a liquid chemical on him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Detectives investigated the incident as a hate crime but local news outlets cited police sources saying it was believed to be a hoax.

The Chicago Police Department is investigating how information about the alleged attack was leaked to journalists.

Fox cut Smollett's character in ""Empire"" after he was arrested.

According to prosecutors, Smollett wrote a $3,500 check to two brothers and gave them $100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps used in the supposed Jan. 29 attack.

Nearly a month and a half after Jussie Smollett claimed he was brutally assaulted in the streets of Chicago, the Empire actor appeared in court today to enter a plea to multiple charges of having given a false account to the police.

With lawyers and family in the Cook County courthouse attorney, Tina Glandian expectedly plead “not guilty” for the subdued actor to the 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct. First charged and arrested on February 21 over the seemingly violent January 29 incident that Chicago PD initially considered a “potential hate crime,” Smollett was indicted on the more than a dozen new charges on March 8.

The Empire actor was arraigned on a 16-count felony indictment, of which he has denied all charges.

Smollett was charged in February with the felony offence of filing a false police report over an alleged homophobic and racist attack in January.

Doubt was cast over his claims that he had been the victim of a hate crime when it emerged that he allegedly knew two men being investigated for the incident. He has denied all allegations against him.

Each count in the grand jury indictment carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine. It is reported that upon conviction in such cases sentences run concurrently with probation the likely outcome.

Smollett was indicted by a Cook County grand jury on those 16 felony counts last week after being accused of lying to police regarding a Jan. 29 incident, in which he said he was randomly attacked by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs in his Chicago neighborhood.

The “Empire” star was originally charged with one felony count for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office last month.

Judge Steven Watkins has been assigned to preside over Smollett’s case, with the actor set to return to court on April 17, according to CBS Chicago.

Representatives for Smollett and a spokesperson for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for confirmation.

Smollett surrendered himself to Chicago police on Feb. 21, hours after he was formally charged. He was released from police custody later that afternoon, after posting bail and surrendering his passport following a bond hearing.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” Smollett’s team said in a statement that day. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Within hours of his release from police custody, Smollett returned to work on the set of “Empire.” However, the following day, executive producers announced that they had decided to remove the actor — who plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon — from the final two episodes of the show’s current season.

During a press conference last month, hours after Smollett’s surrender on Feb. 21, Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that the actor staged an attack on himself because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.” He also told reporters the police were in possession of a $3,500 check, which he said Smollett used to pay brothers Olabinjo (“Ola”) and Abimbola (“Abel”) Osundairo for the incident.

The Osundairos were released without charges Feb. 15, following an arrest and 48-hour hold, after the police said “new evidence” had emerged and that the investigation’s “trajectory” had changed course.

The Empire star, 36, appeared in court in Cook County, Chicago, on Thursday, March 14. He was granted permission to travel to Los Angeles and New York for meetings with his lawyers, so long as he notifies the court 48 hours in advance and checks back in within 24 hours after returning to the state of Illinois. Smollett is set to reappear in court in mid-April.

Just one day before his hearing, Empire’s season 5 midseason premiere aired, marking the hit Fox drama’s first new episode since the scandal surrounding Smollett made headlines in January. His character, Jamal Lyon, breaks down in tears during the emotional episode as sings about his tumultuous relationship with fiancé Kai Givens (Toby Onwumere). The couple ultimately end their relationship because Kai has trouble accepting Jamal’s criminal background.

Serayah McNeill, who stars as Tina Brown, previously revealed to Us Weekly exclusively that Smollett’s legal issues have been difficult for the cast to process. “I think that it definitely has an effect on everyone,” she admitted in the latest issue of Us. “Right now, everyone is fine and everyone is finishing up the season and being professional about it. Everyone is acting very professionally. We all love this show and we have a job to do.”

Smollett initially claimed to the Chicago Police Department that he was attacked on January 29 by two men who were yelling homophobic and racist remarks at him. Two weeks later, authorities arrested brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, but released the actors, whom had minor roles on Empire, just hours later without filing charges.

Smollett was later charged on February 21 with felony disorderly conduct for making a false police report. Officials accused him of staging the attack due to his dissatisfaction with his Empire salary and he was later released on a $100,000 bond.

The actor returned to the Empire set just hours after he was let go from custody, but the network later said in a statement to Us that he would be cut from the remainder of the season: “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The episode found the Lyons in disarray in the wake of the bombshell reveal that Kingsley (A.Z. Kelsey) is Lucious' biological son. But the big shocker came at the end of the hour, when Andre (Trai Byers) wound up in a serious car wreck after passing out behind the wheel.

Discover your new favorite show: Watch This Now!

The incident lines up with a flash-forward from earlier in the season that alluded to his death — he was seen flatlining on a hospital gurney. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, showrunner Brett Mahoney confirmed the flash-forward in question is set to close to the season finale, giving weight to the theory that he may actually be the one Lucious mourns in the future. But could he also be a red herring?

There is still very little known about this imminent death, and Andre certainly seems like the prime candidate. However, he's not the only one. Lucious' emotional reaction to whomever is in that casket suggests a close personal attachment, which also puts Jamal (Jussie Smollett), Hakeem (Bryshere ""Yazz"" Gray), and Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) squarely into the mix. And given the recent legal issues Smollett has had, which have resulted in the actor being cut from the final episodes of the season, it would not be surprising if Jamal was the person in the casket. However, we're still placing our bet on either Kingsley or his ailing mother Tracy after this week's episode made it clear Lucious is feeling guilty about everything that has gone down for them. Kingsley rejected Lucious' offer to reconcile, a choice that may have sealed his fate. As we've seen in the past, enemies of the Lyon family tend to wind up dead... or missing.

We've got our own theories about this mystery, but we'd like to hear from you. Take our poll below and let us know who you think is in that casket.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court again on April 17.

If anyone expected Smollett to hide his face and bow his head in shame, that didn’t happen during his appearance as he strutted in front of the cameras with what appeared to be his family and friends in tow to offer up his non-guilty plea. He was also joined by his TV dad actor Terrance Howard.

The actor alleges he was attacked by two men who beat him, shouted homophobic slurs and poured bleach on him. He said they used the phrase “MAGA country” during the alleged assault.

While first appearing as a victim, Smollett’s case shifted pretty quickly when police identified two brothers who allege that they helped Smollett orchestrate the attack and was paid to do so.

Smollett was indicted on 16 counts of filing a false police report in connection with an assault he alleges took place in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 in Chicago.

But even his family couldn’t help him out of this dire situation once Chicago PD set their sights on Smollett, but they tried.

Lawyer Tina Glandian entered the plea on behalf of the 36-year-old actor during a hearing in Cook County Circuit Court after Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to oversee the case, including the trial.

Watkins granted Smollett’s request to be allowed to meet with lawyers in New York and California, but said the actor must give the court at least 48 hours’ prior notice. He scheduled the next hearing for April 17.

Smollett is charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show, hired two friends to help him stage the attack on him in downtown Chicago early on the morning of Jan. 29. They say Smollett was unhappy about his salary and wanted to drum up publicity to help his career.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack and maintains he is innocent. His attorneys have called the charges against him “prosecutorial overkill.”

There were several supporters outside the courthouse doors as Smollett arrived for the hearing, including some who waved signs. Activist Wisdom Cole led a few chants in support of the actor, the black community and the LGBT community.

“Jussie has been a person of high caliber and character. He comes from an activist family. He has a consistent track record and history of supporting marginalized people … and so his track record is not on par with the idea of a hoax,” she said.

It didn’t receive a warm welcome from viewers.

Last night’s 8 p.m. episode settled for a 1.3 demo rating/6 share among adults 18-49, and 4.412 million total viewers — those Nielsen numbers are way down from last year’s comparable hour and are even down double digits versus the hip-hop soap opera’s fall finale.

The previous original “Empire” episode on Dec. 5 had a 1.5 rating and 5.043 million total viewers. Last year’s midseason return put up a 2.0 rating and tallied 6.217 million viewers.

Wednesday’s hour was down 13 percent in both the demo and for the overall audience versus the fall finale, and down 35 percent in the demo and 29 percent in viewers from last year’s midseason premiere episode.

As a matter of fact, last night’s “Empire” drew the second-smallest audience and second-worst demo rating ever for “Empire.” The only episode to draw fewer “live” eyeballs (4.229 million) and a lower demo rating (a 1.2) aired on Halloween 2018, which makes sense, as people were out celebrating and not in front of their TVs.

That said, Fox and its regular abbreviated (compared with CBS, ABC and NBC) primetime schedule still finished first in key-demo averages, but it just barely edged ABC — with a different of 17,000 viewers — for third in terms of total viewers. NBC aired all reruns last night and still landed a bigger audience than both of those nets.

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, in the days following the alleged attack, Foxx tried persuading Police Supt. Eddie Johnson to turn over the investigation to the FBI. It's being reported that Tina Tchen, former chief of staff to Michelle Obama and a Chicago attorney, contacted Foxx via text messages and emails.

Tchen reached out to Foxx on behalf of the Smollett family saying, ""I wanted to give you a call on behalf of Jussie Smollett and family who I know,"" Tchen wrote in a text. ""They have concerns about the investigation."" Tchen then attempted to set up a phone meeting with the next few hours of the text before she had to catch a morning flight. Not long after, one of Smollett's relatives texted Foxx after receiving her information from Tchen. The relative said they had questions regarding the leaked information to the media reportedly coming from police sources.

“They had no doubt about the quality of the investigation, but believed that the FBI would have a tighter lid on the information,” said Foxx. She also added that Johnson seemed as if he was on board with an FBI investigation and said that she'd recommended the same for other cases in the past.

Because she engaged in conversations with the relative during the time when the attack was being investigated as a hate crime and not a hoax, Foxx removed herself from the case. She formally did so on February 13, the last date she had contact with the relative and just a week before Smollett was officially charged.

""Spoke to the superintendent earlier. He is going to make the ask. Trying to figure out logistics. I’ll keep you posted,” Foxx wrote to the relative. Then the relative, whose name has been blocked out in documents, replied, ""OMG this would be a huge victory.""

Foxx also emailed Tchen, ""Spoke to the Superintendent Johnson. I convinced him to reach out to FBI to ask that they take over the investigation. He is reaching out now and will get to me shortly.” Meanwhile, Smollett recently was spotted walking into the Cook County courthouse to attend a hearing for his case—a hearing he wasn't even required to be at.

Tchen also gave Foxx’s number to a relative of Smollett who then also engaged in conversations about the case. The conversations are the reason Foxx stepped down and recused herself because of the conflict.

Smollett has been formally indicted by a grand jury in Chicago on 16 felony counts after allegedly lying to authorities about being the victim of a racist and homophobic hate attack in late January.

According to text messages uncovered by the outlet, Tchen contacted Foxx on Feb. 1, three days after Smollett made the claims that he was attacked.

“I wanted to give you a call on behalf of Jussie Smollett and family who I know. They have concerns about the investigation,” Tchen wrote in a text sent before 5 a.m., seeking to set up a call with Foxx before Tchen left on an 8 a.m. flight to New York, the outlet reports.

Foxx later received a text from a relative of Smollett, who had received her number from Tchen. The relative cited concerns over leaked information surrounding the investigation.

“They had no doubt about the quality of the investigation, but believed that the FBI would have a tighter lid on the information,” said Foxx. She said Johnson at first wasn’t adverse to the FBI taking over the case.

Other texts said:

“Spoke to the superintendent earlier. He is going to make the ask. Trying to figure out logistics. I’ll keep you posted,” Foxx wrote to the relative of Smollett.

“OMG this would be a huge victory,” the relative texted in reply.

In an email message to Tchen sent the same day, Foxx wrote: “Spoke to the Superintendent Johnson. I convinced him to reach out to FBI to ask that they take over the investigation. He is reaching out now and will get to me shortly.”

Foxx said this is something she has done in the past for non-celebs as well.

The FBI, however, had been involved with the case from the beginning said, Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

An internal investigation is underway because of leaked information that was sent to the media throughout the investigation.

72,1,https://tvline.com/2019/03/13/empire-recap-season-5-episode-10-jussie-smollett-jamal/,"Empire returned from its midseason hiatus Wednesday with its first episode since Jussie Smollett‘s February arrest for allegedly orchestrating his own hate crime. And it was weird.

In something of an eerie coincidence (considering “My Fault is Past” was shot months before the embattled actor’s alleged attack on the streets of Chicago and subsequent dismissal from Season 5), the episode’s plot found Jamal enduring crises on multiple fronts.

“I don’t know if you’ve been reading the blogs, but it’s been kind of a tough week,” Jamal lamented to an enthusiastic, standing room only crowd at his high school alma mater after wrapping up an impromptu performance midway through the episode. Pre-scandal, the line would’ve breezed by like a speck of dust. Post scandal, however, the line — and the moment that surrounded it — packed a discomforting punch, the unintentional parallels impossible to ignore. (Smollett himself headlined a similarly intimate comeback-themed concert in the immediate aftermath of The Incident.)

The triumphant display arrived in the in the wake of Jamal discovering that the Lyon family’s arch nemesis, Jeff Kingsley, is actually Lucious’ son (and thus his long-lost half brother). And it preceded his presumed breakup with fiancé Kai, who stormed out after Jamal refused to put his lover before his lineage. Standing alone in the apartment, the weight of the loss suffocating him, Jamal broke down.

To be fair, Jamal was not the only member of the Lyon clan having the worst week ever. The news of Kingsley’s parentage gave Andre a brain hemorrhage. It also sent Cookie into a bit of a spiral, leading her to confront the ailing crack addict who birthed Lucious’ bastard child from hell. But instead of feeling anger toward “White Tracy,” Cookie was overcome with empathy. She saw in Kingsley’s ma something of a kindred spirit: another woman wronged by Lucious.

“Empire was built on drugs, Lucious,” Cookie tore into Lucious, her epiphany taking shape before her eyes during the episode’s closing scene. “On people’s pain. My pain. Jamal’s pain. My sister’s pain. And we keep coming back to it over and over and over again like a junkie chasing that first high… We did bad things Lucious. And it’s coming back.”

Empire actor Jussie Smollett pleads not guilty to 'staging racist and homophobic attack'

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic assault.

The 36-year-old's lawyer entered the plea on his behalf during a court appearance in Chicago.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and openly gay, hired two men to help stage an attack on him in downtown Chicago in the early hours of 29 January.

He told detectives that two masked men beat him while hurling racist and homophobic slurs, and that they poured an unknown substance on him before hanging a noose around his neck, police say.

Officers initially investigated the incident as a hate crime but, police sources at the time were reported as saying the attack had been a hoax.

A grand jury charged Smollett on 16 felony counts relating to the filing of a false police report earlier in March. Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

They came after an initial charge on 20 February, of one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett's character was axed from the TV show by Fox after the actor's arrest.

He has denied staging the attack and maintains his innocence, with his lawyers previously saying that the indictment is ""vindictive"" and ""prosecutorial overkill"".

“It’s a matter of trusting the process and allowing the legal process to play out and see where it goes from there,” Executive producer and showrunner Brett Mahoney told Entertainment Weekly.

“And it’s too early to think about what we would have to do if we didn’t have Jussie,” he told EW. “We have such a strong ensemble and we have so many stories to tell for all of these fascinating characters that it’s bigger than one character, but it’s too early to think about the show without him.”

—Beto O’Rourke throws his hat in the ring, announces run for president—

While the Empire brass hasn’t decided whether to cancel Smollett’s character altogether, earlier this month, they did clip his scenes. The show co-created by film industry giant Lee Daniels already announced that Smollett was cut from the final two episodes of the current season.

Even cutting those scenes was tough Mahoney said, as rumors swirled that there was turmoil on set.

“It was a very difficult decision, but I think in terms of allowing the cast and the crew to really get the work done without a great deal of disruption in terms of the day-to-day and the stress of the day-to-day, and, in addition, allowing Jussie the time to really deal with what he’s been confronted with and allow him the time to focus and prepare his case, this seems like the logical decision to make,” Mahoney told Entertainment Weekly.

It was a collective decision made by executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo, Dennis Hammer and Mahoney to change the final episodes to “avoid further disruption on set.”

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” the producers said in a statement at the time. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

—Smollett relative and former Michelle Obama aide tried to influence case and reached out to Chicago prosecutor Kim Foxx—

Smollett was indicted on 16 counts of filing a false police report in connection with an assault he alleges took place in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 in Chicago.

The actor said he was attacked by two men who beat him, shouted homophobic slurs at him and poured bleach on him. He said they used the phrase “MAGA country” during the alleged assault — an apparent reference to “Make America Great Again,” the campaign slogan of President Donald Trump.

The show returned Wednesday night after a three-month break.

Rumors have also swirled that the show is facing cancellation because of the Smollett ordeal. Mahoney said don’t count them out just yet.

“I’m not surprised that we don’t necessarily have a pick up at this point as I think last season we waited until May,” he said. “All the indications I have are that we will be. And we do have so many of these stories to tell, so I can’t imagine we won’t be able to tell them.”",2019-03-14 00:00:00,"Empire showrunners don’t have immediate plans to fire Jussie Smollett, will await court decision",[],"['mahoney', 'tell', 'decision', 'process', 'plans', 'dont', 'showrunners', 'early', 'final', 'await', 'smollett', 'court', 'told', 'episodes', 'think', 'immediate', 'empire', 'jussie']",79

Wearing a navy suit and dress coat, Smollett, 36, appeared serious and quiet standing next to his attorneys as Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to his case.

In a 16-count indictment returned by a grand jury last Thursday, Smollett, who is black, openly gay and plays a gay musician on Fox’s hip-hop drama, was charged with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a US$25,000 fine.

Smollett was previously charged last month with felony disorderly conduct for making a false report after he told police he was attacked in January by masked supporters of President Donald Trump who beat him, slung a noose round his neck and poured a liquid chemical on him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Detectives investigated the incident as a hate crime but local news outlets cited police sources saying it was believed to be a hoax.

The Chicago Police Department is investigating how information about the alleged attack was leaked to journalists.

Fox cut Smollett’s character in “Empire” after he was arrested.

According to prosecutors, Smollett wrote a US$3,500 check to two brothers and gave them US$100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps used in the supposed Jan 29 attack.

Police said Smollett hoped the incident would advance his career and secure him a higher salary.

Police initially arrested the brothers on Feb 13, after they were recognised from surveillance footage from near the scene of the alleged attack. One had appeared with Smollett on “Empire,” police and their lawyer said. Prosecutors said one had supplied Smollett with “designer drugs” in the past.

The brothers confessed to the plot, police said. They became cooperating witnesses and were released without charges.

After the alleged attack, Smollett received support on social media, including from celebrities and Democratic presidential candidates. Others were sceptical of the incident, which Smollett said occurred at around 2am on a city street during one of the coldest weeks in recent history.

Outside the courthouse on Thursday, about a dozen supporters gathered with signs, chanting that his prosecution was unjust.

In a “Good Morning America” interview last month, Smollett said he was angry some people questioned his story and suggested racial bias may be behind the disbelief.

Jussie Smollett has pleaded not guilty to 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct, maintaining his innocence amid allegations that he faked a possible hate crime against himself earlier this year. Smollett's legal team entered the plea Thursday at a courthouse in Chicago, while the Empire actor and singer looked on silently.

The actor's plea comes just a month and a half after his original police report grabbed national attention. In the report filed in late January, Smollett told authorities that he had been jumped while walking through downtown Chicago just past midnight. According to the Empire star, who is black and openly gay and who plays a gay character on the television show, his two assailants verbally showered him with racial and anti-gay slurs — before physically assaulting him, pouring a chemical on him and leaving him with a rope wrapped around his neck.

When it surfaced, the report elicited outrage from both his colleagues and national politicians. But within a month, the story appeared to unravel.

Chicago police eventually arrested Smollett on suspicion that he had faked the incident ""to promote his career,"" saying at a news conference last month that he paid his would-be attackers — brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo — to carry it out. Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that the two men implicated Smollett while under police interrogation and that authorities had the check that Smollett wrote them in payment to prove it.

""As more evidence, such as text messages, phone records, social media records, bank records, surveillance video and the receipt from the purchase of the rope was obtained by investigators, the investigation shifted from a Hate Crime to a Disorderly Conduct investigation [against Smollett],"" prosecutors explained in their bond proffer.

Smollett, meanwhile, vehemently defended himself against what his legal team — in a statement last month — called ""an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.""

""There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that's been presented as fact and evidence against Mr. Smollett that is demonstrably false,"" his attorney Tina Glandian said after a hearing Tuesday in Chicago, as her client walked quickly past the media scrum. ""We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that members of the media can see the actual evidence — and what we feel is actually going to be a lack of evidence — against Mr. Smollett. And we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out.""

The actor's colleagues on Empire wasted little time in responding to the allegations. In a statement released just a day after his arrest, the show's producers said that they ""care about him deeply"" and that they were placing ""trust in the legal system as the process plays out.""

But they added: ""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show, and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove [Smollett's] role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""

A grand jury in Cook County, Ill., indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct last week. Each count carries a possible penalty of up to three years in prison.

“Empire” returned with Jussie Smollett for its midseason premiere on Wednesday, and fans went wild over his onscreen persona dealing with public drama as the actor in real life faces 16 felony counts for his alleged hate crime hoax.

On the episode, Smollett’s character, Jamal, had to end his engagement when his fiancé, Kai, couldn’t agree with his family’s illegal actions. Eventually, Jamal’s family became involved in some high-profile drama, which he had to address.

“I don’t know if y’all been reading the blogs and all the foolishness, but it’s kinda been a tough week,” Jamal said.

Twitter couldn’t get enough of the irony.

“LeeDaniels is a psychic,” one fan tweeted about “Empire’s” creator.

“Jussie Smollett watching #Empire right now,” tweeted another, who included a gif of Anthony Anderson crying.

However, some viewers were uncomfortable watching Smollett on their TVs, even though the episode had been filmed a while ago.

“I’m sorry it’s so hard for me to look at jussie without wanting to slap the s–t outta him #Empire,” a viewer tweeted.

“I’m just ready to see them write off Jamal #Empire,” a fan tweeted, alongside a gif of a woman giving a glare.

“‘it’s been a tough week’ …hahaha more like a month so far, Jussie 😂#Empire,” another wrote.

Ever since the microscope has focused on Jussie Smollett as a potential criminal in his previously reported hate crime, rather than the victim he was initially perceived to be, the fate of his Empire character Jamal Lyon has been up in the air. That issue recently escalated when Smollett was indicted by an Illinois grand jury on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct.

Showrunner Brett Mahoney talked with Entertainment Weekly about how the legal matters surrounding the show’s co-star have affected production, as well as the “difficult” decision to snatch Smollett from the last two episodes of the fifth season.

“It’s been an emotional rollercoaster,” Mahoney said. “You have someone in your family who’s going through this, while at the same time, we’re shooting the final episodes of the season, which are also just heightened emotionally. So it was a lot to deal with and a lot to go through, but we’re really just focused on finishing strong. We’re in our last week of production and I’m really proud of the work we’ve done this season, and hopefully, the fans will really engage with these back nine episodes.”

Mahoney knows rumors exist, but insists he really isn’t privy to it all in his “day-to-day” schedule. He also confirmed the cast is really focused on continuing to provide their fans with a good show.

“I think the cast and crew is really just focused on working and everyone feels good about the work we’re doing, and we’re hoping that we can be judged on that work. Everyone is really focused on getting these episodes done, despite everything that is going on around us,” he noted. “Also, I don’t really see it as something that is dividing people, more like bringing people together, bringing the cast and crew together in terms of let’s get this done.”

Mahoney also touched on the team’s decision to remove Smollett from the final two episodes of the current season, which recently returned from its mid-season break on Wednesday night.

“It was a very difficult decision, but I think in terms of allowing the cast and the crew to really get the work done without a great deal of disruption in terms of the day-to-day and the stress of the day-to-day, and, in addition, allowing Jussie the time to really deal with what he’s been confronted with and allow him the time to focus and prepare his case, this seems like the logical decision to make,” said Mahoney.

As for Jamal’s fate, there have been a lot of rumors circulating on whether or not we’ll be seeing him in the future. A recent Variety report stated, there’s a possibility Jamal’s character could either be killed off or recast. The show, which is still doing well in ratings for the network, landing in the number 2 spot behind 9-1-1, is expected to be renewed for a sixth season. Some have speculated that the show could (or should) be canceled. As IndieWire noted, abrupt cancell ation may be “overkill,” and the cases in which that has happened with television shows are “extreme.”

Mahoney isn’t giving a definitive answer on Jamal’s fate at this point, though, saying it’s “too early.” Plus, Jamal’s character had a major development in the first half of Season 5, having gotten engaged to Kai Givens (Toby Onwumere).

“It’s a matter of trusting the process and allowing the legal process to play out and see where it goes from there,” confirmed Mahoney. “And it’s too early to think about what we would have to do if we didn’t have Jussie.

Episode 510, titled “My Fault is Past,” was the first new installment to air since the midseason finale on Dec. 5.

That also makes it the first new episode since Smollett reported being attack by two men in Chicago on Jan. 29, was charged with filing a false police report for that same incident on Feb. 21, and then indicted on 16 felony counts by a grand jury last week. He is set to appear in court tomorrow.

But setting aside all of that stuff going on with Smollett, for those of you wondering, here’s what his on-screen alter ego, Jamal — the openly gay son of Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) — was doing on “Empire” tonight.

Before we begin, allow us to remind you that the show ended its winter finale with a big cliffhanger in which Jeff Kingsley (A.Z. Kelsey) told Cookie, Andre (Trai Byers), Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray) and Jamal that he is Lucious’ son and a flash-forward showing Andre flatlining in front of his parents, giving fans more fuel for their theories about who is in that casket in all those other flash-forward scenes we’ve seen this season.

OK, now tonight’s episode picked up right where that one left off, with Cookie and Lucious discussing how they still need to take down Kingsley and take back Empire.

Then they have a “grownup talk” with their boys, telling them Kelly Patel is looking to sell his stake in Empire, as the stock is currently tanking due to the bad press from the data mining story Jamal’s fiance, Kai (Toby Onwumere), recently published. They need to prove Lucious is innocent and throw it all on Kingsley and he wants Jamal to get Kai’s help in this.

“Here we go, just going back to something that brings out the worst in us,” Jamal says and tells his parents they need to do this on their own if they want to go back to Empire, a place that “destroyed” them.

When Cookie and Lucious leave, Jamal turns to his brothers to discuss the elephant in the room: Kingsley.

Hakeem wants to go “beat his ass” but Jamal says “we ain’t gonna beat nobody’s ass.”

Then, Jamal goes to meet with Kai to see if they can work things out after their fight on the last episode, with Jamal worried about how Kai’s story is affecting the Lyons. He asks for Kai’s help after all, which doesn’t seem like an option as he’s off to London and wants Jamal to pick between him and his parents. But Jamal reminds Kai he is also hurting Becky (Gabourey Sidibe) in all this, who is accused of being part of the data mining in the lawsuit that has been filed against Empire.

Later, Becky and Jamal are drowning their sorrows over all the drama and he tries to make her feel better with a new song he’s just made. He is going to give it to Devon to perform, but Becky says he needs to make it a Jamal single. Then she decides to take him some place that’s going to cheer him up: Urban Arts High School.

Jamal performs his new song at his alma mater, singing these lyrics: “I’m probably, I’m probably gonna do some bad/I’m probably, probably gone have to fight/But know there ain’t nothin’ that I can’t have/Eventually I will be alright.”

He tells the kids he doesn’t know “if you guys have been reading the blogs” and “all that foolishness” that’s out there about his family right now and asks them to “stick together.” Then he and Becky go off much happier than before.

Jamal then joins Andre and his parents at Empire headquarters, where Lucious and Cookie announce they are joining forces with Kelly Patel and returning to Empire after clearing Lucious’ name in the data-mining scandal. Everyone starts shouting “to the Empire!” and Cookie pauses to say they are in service to the fans now, but Lucious cuts in to bring back the party vibe.

Then Jamal is shocked to learn from Lucious that the they were able to clear his name thanks to Kai. Jamal finds Kai and thanks him, but Kai reveals the way they got the evidence to clear Lucious’ name was by dangling one of Kai’s sources out a window until he handed it over.

Kai tells Jamal violence doesn’t scare him, but the Lyons do. He reminds him they were so happy in London away from Jamal’s family and asks him to “just go home” with him.

And Jamal tells Kai if he’s going to be with him, then he has to understand all of him and that he’s a Lyon and he’s done apologizing for that. Then Jamal gives Kai back his engagement ring and Kai leaves and Jamal breaks down crying and kicks over his keyboard.

The episode ends with Jamal playing a piano and singing over his parents fighting about what Empire has done to their family. And this is before anyone has even found out that Andre had some unexplained nosebleed and passed out on his drive home.

The 36-year-old actor will return to court in April and will be allowed to travel between New York City and Los Angeles to meet with lawyers.

He was accompanied by some but not all of his family and said nothing as he strode quickly into the courthouse wearing a pair of sunglasses.

He was searched by security before entering the courtroom. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 48 years behind bars.

Smollett, who insists he is innocent, is accused of paying brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo to attack him on January 29. They told police the actor wanted a raise on Empire, the Fox show in which he is one of the central characters.

On Thursday, he spoke only to say 'not guilty' when his lawyer entered his plea on his behalf, joining in with her mid-sentence, and to answer 'yes sir' as Judge Steven Gregory Watkins told him he had to show up to every day of the trial.

Smollett spoke only to the judge, addressing him as 'sir' and saying 'not guilty' as his lawyer entered his plea. He is shown above looking at his legal team as they agree on April 17 for his next court date

After pleading not guilty on all counts, Smollett left the court with his family without making a statement.

He was heckled on his way out of the courthouse as he got into a waiting car by someone shouting: 'You f***d up! Lock him up!'

On Thursday, Tina Glandian, one of his attorneys said they 'welcomed' the case being open to the public and media.

'We welcome cameras in the courtroom so the public and the media can see the evidence and we believe is a lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,' she said.

The judge granted Smollett permission to travel to California and New York, where his legal team has offices, to meet with them but said he must notify pre-trial services 48 hours before and 24 hours after he returns from any trips.

Glandian was accompanied by two other lawyers from Mark Geragos' firm. Geragos is a celebrity favorite who has represented Chris Brown and Michael Jackson in the past.

The actor's face was tense as he arrived in the courtroom in a suit and tie

He has spoken publicly since Smollett's indictment to claim he is the victim of a prejudiced media and police department.

The police department insists its investigation has been above board.

Members of Smollett's team told the media at the courthouse that his Empire co-star Terrence Howard had planned to attend the arraignment but that his flight was delayed arriving in Chicago.

They said he would likely attend later sessions.

Smollett's court appearance coincided with the revelation that his family contacted former Michelle Obama aide Tina Tchen to get in touch with State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx to tell her they had 'concerns' with how the police were handling it days after the attack.

They were worried, they said, about the amount of information that was being leaked to the media from the start of the investigation.

Tchen persuaded her to try to pawn the case off to the FBI, according to text messages obtained by USA Today.

Foxx said she was 'trying' and had spoken to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnston to try to 'convince' him to let the FBI take the lead on the investigation.

She also exchanged text with one of Smollett's relatives who replied: 'Omg this would be a huge victory,' when Foxx mentioned her efforts.

The actor arrived in court in Chicago on Thursday to enter a plea on 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct. He put his hand on his heart as he walked past protesters shouting 'Justice for Jussie!'

Ultimately, the case did not move on to the FBI because there was not enough evidence that Smollett had been the victim of a hate crime as he claimed.

Foxx recused herself from the case after Smollett was arrested, saying at the time that her contact with a family member of his was a conflict of interest in the case.

Tchen, who worked with the Obamas when they were in the White House, has not publicly commented on the case.

Smollett did not initially want to involve the police on the night of the attack.

It was his friend, 60-year-old Frank Gatson, who insisted they call 911 after he arrived back at his apartment with a rope around his neck and bleach on his clothes, claiming to have been assaulted by two men who shouted: 'This is MAGA country!' as they beat him.

The Smollett family enlisted the help of former Obama adviser Tina Tchen (seen above with the couple in the White House) to try to get the investigation taken over by the FBI

State's Attorney Kim Foxx told the Smollett family she was 'trying' to convince the Chicago PD to let the FBI take over the case but it never happened. She recused herself later over the conflict of interest. On Thursday, trial judge Steven Gregory Watkins (right) was assigned to Smollett's case

It was 2am and he had gone out to get a salad from Subway.

In the weeks that followed, Chicago PD sources gradually leaked information about the case to local media about how Smollett was refusing to hand over his phone records.

As they combed through surveillance footage from the night of the attack, they honed in on the Osundairo brothers and tracked their ride share and taxi movements.

They then arrested the pair on February 20 as they arrived back in Chicago from Nigeria.

In the 47th hour of their 48 hour hold, the brothers confessed to the plot.

Wednesday's new episode hit a series low with fewer than 4 million viewers, according to Nielsen. The previous lowest-rated ""Empire"" episode aired on Halloween 2018 and had 4.2 million viewers, according to Variety.

The show's first new episode to air after Smollett's arrest also dropped significantly in ratings last week. The Fox series returned after a winter hiatus a week ago to 4.412 million viewers, according to Nielsen.

That was a drop from the last episode in December before the hiatus, which reeled in 5.043 million viewers (down 13%), but a big drop from last year's comparable premiere, which had 6.2 million viewers (down 35%), according to The Wrap.

Smollett, who has a supporting role on the show as Jamal Lyon, claimed earlier this year that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic assault. But Chicago police said that Smollett staged the attack as a publicity stunt because he was unhappy with his ""Empire"" salary. Smollett turned himself in to police last month.

Smollett was recently making as much as $125,000, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The show's producers said in a statement following his arrest that Smollett will be written out of the show.

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our 'Empire' family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,"" they said. ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""

Smollett's character on last week's episode ended his engagement because his fiancé had problems with his family's illegal activities. At one point, he says, ""I don't know if y'all been reading the blogs and all the foolishness, but it's kinda been a tough week.""",2019-03-14 00:00:00,'Empire' ratings plunge after Jussie Smollett's arrest,['Travis Clark'],"['according', 'smolletts', 'process', 'viewers', 'smollett', 'plunge', 'role', 'arrest', 'ratings', 'episode', 'empire', 'million', 'jussie', 'shows', 'past']",93
88,1,https://nypost.com/2019/03/14/former-michelle-obama-aide-tried-to-intervene-in-jussie-smollett-probe/,"After being contacted by a Chicago attorney who served as former first lady Michelle Obama’s chief of staff, the top prosecutor in Cook County asked the city’s top cop to turn over the Jussie Smollett probe to the FBI, according to reports.

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx reached out to Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson after Tina Tchen, the former senior Obama official, emailed the prosecutor saying the “Empire” actor’s family had “concerns” about the probe, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

Tchen passed Foxx’s number to a family member of Smollett, and the ensuing conversations with the relative were later cited by the prosecutor as the reason she recused herself from the probe, according to the paper, which obtained messages from Foxx in response to a public records request.

Text messages show Tchen contacted Foxx on Feb. 1, three days after Smollett reported that he was attacked by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him and put his neck in a noose.

Tchen, a close friend of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s wife, sent a text message to Foxx to set up an early morning phone call, according to the newspaper.

“I wanted to give you a call on behalf of Jussie Smollett and family who I know. They have concerns about the investigation,” texted Tchen, who sought to set up a call with Foxx before flying out to New York at 8 a.m.

The text messages show Foxx told both Tchen and Smollett’s relative that Foxx had reached out to Johnson about handing the probe to the feds.

“Spoke to the Superintendent Johnson,” Foxx emailed Tchen the same day. “I convinced him to Reach out to FBI to ask that they take over the investigation. He is reaching out now and will get to me shortly.”

The same day, Foxx texted with Smollett’s relative, whose name was blacked out in the released copies.

“Spoke to the superintendent earlier, he made the ask,” Foxx wrote. “Trying to figure out logistics. I’ll keep you posted.”

“Omg this would be a huge victory,” the family member replied.

“I make no guarantees, but I’m trying,” Foxx wrote back.

Fox told the Sun-Times this week that the relative expressed concerns about leaked information about the probe — information that media outlets attributed to “police sources.”

“They had no doubt about the quality of the investigation, but believed that the FBI would have a tighter lid on the information,” said Foxx, adding that the police commissioner appeared receptive at first to the idea of turning the case over to the FBI.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the newspaper that the feds were involved from the start of the possible hate crime investigation, but that there was never any talk of the police giving up the case to the FBI.

Smollett, 36, who is black and gay, is accused of recruiting two brothers to orchestrate the attack because he was upset with his pay on the TV show, police have said.

He faces 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report and lying to cops.

The brothers told police that Smollett plotted the assault, gave them money to buy supplies for the attack and paid them $3,500 for taking part in the alleged plot.

The brothers — Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — have not been charged.

Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty Thursday to 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct accusing him of lying to police when he told them two men unleashed a racist and homophobic attack on him in Chicago.

The 36-year-old “Empire” actor appeared serious and quiet as his lawyer, Tina Glandian, entered the plea on his behalf.

Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven Watkins, who was assigned to be the trial judge, granted Smollett’s request to be allowed to travel to New York and California to meet his lawyers.

But the judge told Smollett he must give the court at least 48 hours’ notice before leaving Illinois while he is free on bail — and warned him to be present and on time for all of his upcoming court dates.

Smollett’s next court appearance is scheduled for April 17.

Several Smollett supporters showed up outside the courthouse as the actor and his counsel arrived for the hearing, including people waving signs reading “I Stand With Jussie” and “I Believe Jussie Smollett.”

Activist Wisdom Cole led chants in support of Smollett and for the black and LGBT communities.

“Jussie has been a person of high caliber and character,” she said. “He comes from an activist family. He has a consistent track record and history of supporting marginalized people . . . and so his track record is not on par with the idea of a hoax.”

Presiding Criminal Court Judge LeRoy Martin allowed a camera in the courtroom on Thursday, but it will be up to Watkins to decide whether to allow cameras inside for future hearings, according to CBS Chicago.

Smollett’s attorneys have said the actor welcomes cameras in court to prevent the kind of “misinformation” they claim has been leaked to the press since he reported being attacked.

“We look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,” Glandian said.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett — who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show — hired two pals to help stage the attack on him early on the morning of Jan. 29.

He was initially charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct after claiming he was attacked by masked supporters of President Trump who beat him, wrapped a noose round his neck and poured a liquid chemical on him while hurling racist and homophobic slurs.

Police say Smollett was “dissatisfied with his salary” and wanted to whip up publicity to help his career.

After the alleged attack, Smollett received an outpouring of support on social media, including from celebrities and Democratic presidential candidates.

The disgraced performer was ultimately suspended from the show and has been written out of the final two episodes of its ongoing fifth season.

He has denied the charges.

One of Smollett's lawyers, Tina Glandian, entered the plea on Smollett's behalf.

Prior to the arraignment, Judge Steven G. Watkins was assigned to oversee Smollett's case. Watkins made a small change to the terms of Smollett’s bond, saying he will allow Smollett to travel Los Angeles and New York to meet with attorneys without first formally seeking court approval.

Smollett's next court date was set for April 17.

Smollett huddled with his attorneys at the courthouse for more than 30 minutes after the hearing. He and his legal team left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.

Prosecutors, led by Assistant State's Attorney Risa Lanier, also did not comment.

“Empire” star Terrence Howard, who has publicly expressed support for Smollett, planned to attend Thursday’s hearing. He ended up missing it, because he got stuck at the airport while waiting to pick up his wife, whose fight was delayed, according to Smollett spokeswoman Anne Kavanagh.

The actor's legal team said Tuesday that they wanted cameras in the courtroom so the public could see the evidence. Celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos, who joined Smollett's Chicago-based legal team in late February, argued that the worldwide media coverage has robbed Smollett of the presumption of innocence. He said he was not surprised by the indictment.

""What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie,"" Geragos said in a statement last week. ""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records.""

Smollett, 36, told Chicago police that he was attacked in the middle of the night on Jan. 29, claiming that two masked men shouted homophobic and racist abuse at him, beat his face, threw bleach on him, hung a noose around his neck and yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Trump's campaign slogan.

Local shock, a nationwide outcry, and an urgent Chicago police investigation ensued.

While messages of support for Smollett from his famous friends, from presidential candidates and total strangers poured in over social media, police busied themselves watching hours of surveillance video and searching for two murky figures Smollett said were the attackers.

They argued with Smollett about access to his cellphone, they served search warrants, and they eventually arrested two brothers they suspected were the two men on the surveillance video.

For nearly 48 hours – the limit police could hold them – the bodybuilder brothers Ola Osundairo, 27, and Abel Osundairo, 25, were interrogated until, police said, they explained: Smollett, whom they knew through ""Empire"" and working out together, had paid them to help him stage a hoax attack.

On Feb. 20, after a flurry of conflicting leaks from the Chicago Police Department about the status of the investigation (Smollett is a victim, he's not a victim, it is a hoax, it is not a hoax), Smollett was charged by police with one Class 4 felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report about the alleged attack.

He turned himself in early the next day, was arrested and briefly jailed, before being released on $100,000 bond.

Jussie Smollett investigation timeline: How actor went from assault victim to suspect

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers $3,500 to stage an attack on him in order to raise his profile and his TV salary.

Johnson angrily assailed Smollett, saying he smeared Chicago. He told reporters that the actor staged the attack to look like a hate crime in order to ""take advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

“I am left hanging my head asking ‘why?’ Why would anyone – especially an African-American man – use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations,” Johnson told reporters. “Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim who is in need of support by police and investigators as well as the citizens of this city. … I’m offended by what happened and I am also angry.”

On March 8, a county grand jury deepened his legal woes by indicting him on 16 counts of disorderly conduct stemming from the alleged false police report. According to the indictment, the grand jury charged Smollett for every time he allegedly uttered a falsehood to police investigators about what he said happened to him on Jan. 29.

Each count carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison.

The Chicago-bred Osundairo brothers, who were released without charges and who have said through their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, that they regret their role in the case, will likely be among the chief witnesses against Smollett if he goes to trial.

But in media interviews Monday, Schmidt declined to explain why Smollett allegedly asked the Osundairos to stage the attack or why they chose to remain in police detention for nearly 48 hours before telling investigators their story.

But she did confirm several other details: the brothers were friends and workout buddies with Smollett, he paid them for personal training services, they have – and are still – ""fully"" cooperating with police and did not seek a plea deal for their testimony.

Schmidt painted the brothers as hapless innocents who were duped by Smollett.

""This entire thing started because they put their trust in the wrong person, someone who works with them, someone who could help their careers, and then he betrays them,"" she told ""CBS This Morning."" ""They felt their friend would not put them in a situation where they are now labeled as someone who would commit a hate crime. They did not know that their loyalty to him would be betrayed.""

She said the Osundairo brothers have a $3,500 check Smollett gave them. Though it was officially earmarked as payment for personal training services, it was also tacitly intended as an enticement to do him the ""favor"" of staging the attack.

92,1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krystieyandoli/jussie-smollett-pleads-not-guilty,"Empire actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty Thursday to filing a false police report and staging a hate crime.

Smollett told Chicago police that in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 he was attacked by two men who yelled anti-gay slurs, threw a bleachlike chemical on him, put a rope around his neck, and referenced President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

In a February interview with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, Smollett, who is black and openly gay, maintained his innocence, saying he was “pissed off” that people doubted he was attacked.

“At first it was a thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ’cause it’s the truth,” Smollett said of his skeptics. “Then it became a thing of like, oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.""

Earlier this month, a grand jury in Cook County, Illinois, Smollett on 16 felony counts, after finding there was enough evidence of him lying to multiple police officials and filing the false report.

""Jussie Smollett knew that ... there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,"" the grand jury said last week when it indicted Smollett.

When Smollett’s alleged attack was initially reported, the case made national headlines and people supported the actor. As police continued to investigate, it was uncertain how much evidence of the attack there actually was.

“Allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model,” Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi ‏tweeted.

Mark Geragos, a lawyer for Smollett, said in a statement last week that the charges are “nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines"" in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the leaks to the press and invasion of privacy allegations.

Geragos also called the number of charges overkill, and said the indictment was ""redundant and vindictive.""

Meanwhile, the future of Smollett’s role on Fox’s Empire remains uncertain. The network has said his character Jamal will be cut from the final two episodes of the season, but he will be included in episodes filmed up until then. Representatives for When reached on Thursday, Fox had no comment.



A representative for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

Smollett's next court date was scheduled for April 17.

95,1,https://uproxx.com/tv/jussie-smollett-not-guilty-plea/,"Empire actor Jussie Smollett stood before a Chicago criminal court on Thursday morning, where he entered a not guilty plea for allegedly orchestrating a fake hate crime to gain publicity and negotiate more screen-time on the Fox drama series. Smollett is being on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for lying to authorities and filing a false police report claiming that he had been the victim of a racist, homophobic attack.

Yet, despite the growing mountain of evidence against him, Smollett is hard-fast maintaining his innocence. The 36-year-old is still hoping that a $3,500 check he made out to Empire extras Ola and Abel Osundairo will disprove that he staged the attack, despite the brothers claims to the contrary in which they expressed regret for their part in the fiasco:

“There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that’s been presented as fact and evidence against Mr. Smollett that is demonstrably false,” his attorney Tina Glandian said after a hearing Tuesday in Chicago, as her client walked quickly past the media scrum. “We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that members of the media can see the actual evidence — and what we feel is actually going to be a lack of evidence — against Mr. Smollett. And we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out.”

Should Smollett be convicted, each of the 16 felony counts he’s being charged with carry a maximum penalty of three years in prison.

Empire producers released a statement last month that while they care about Smollett deeply, they were placing “trust in the legal system as the process plays out.” In the meantime, they have removed the character of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season to avoid further disruption on set.

The 36-year-old actor was charged with 16 felony counts last week for allegedly masterminding a false attack to gain publicity and win a bigger paycheck.

He is accused of sending himself a threatening letter and hiring two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

News of the attack in January attracted widespread shock and support for the actor, who is gay and black.

Smollett has maintained his innocence and his attorney Tina Glandian earlier this week said the case against him is mired in ""misinformation.""

""There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that has been presented as fact and evidence against Mr Smollett, which is demonstrably false,"" Glandian said Tuesday.

Smollett will be back in court in April.

On Thursday (March 14th) Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty to the numerous felony counts he’s facing. Last week, Smollett was hit with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct by a grand jury. Chicago police are alleging that Smollett orchestrated a fake hate crime attack and then filed false police reports. (Reports alleged that Smollett orchestrated the move because he was unsatisfied with the salary he was making on Empire.)

On January 28th, Smollett told authorities that he was attacked by two white men wearing ski masks. Smollett claimed that the two men were yelling racist and homophobic slurs to him during the attack. Since then, there have been many twists and turns, leading to severe doubt around Smollett’s story. (Head here for a full primer.)

Last month it was announced that Smollett would be cut from the final two episodes of the next season of Empire.

Ratings for Fox’s “Empire” dropped dramatically when the show returned from a hiatus last week. It was the first new episode to air following actor Jussie Smollett’s arrest.

The episode was viewed by 4 million people, according to Nielsen. That’s down 13% from the last episode in December, and 35% from the comparable premiere last year.

Wednesday’s new episode hit a series low with fewer than 4 million viewers.

Chicago police said Smollett staged an assault as a publicity stunt. He turned himself in last month.

Audiences don’t seem too excited for “Empire” following the Jussie Smollett scandal.

Wednesday’s new episode hit a series low with fewer than 4 million viewers, according to Nielsen. The previous lowest-rated “Empire” episode aired on Halloween 2018 and had 4.2 million viewers, according to Variety.

The show’s first new episode to air after Smollett’s arrest also dropped significantly in ratings last week. The Fox series returned after a winter hiatus a week ago to 4.412 million viewers, according to Nielsen.

That was a drop from the last episode in December before the hiatus, which reeled in 5.043 million viewers (down 13%), but a big drop from last year’s comparable premiere, which had 6.2 million viewers (down 35%), according to The Wrap.

Smollett, who has a supporting role on the show as Jamal Lyon, claimed earlier this year that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic assault. But Chicago police said that Smollett staged the attack as a publicity stunt because he was unhappy with his “Empire” salary. Smollett turned himself in to police last month.

Smollett was recently making as much as $US125,000, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The show’s producers said in a statement following his arrest that Smollett will be written out of the show.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,” they said. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Smollett’s character on last week’s episode ended his engagement because his fiancé had problems with his family’s illegal activities. At one point, he says, “I don’t know if y’all been reading the blogs and all the foolishness, but it’s kinda been a tough week.”

The attorney for two brothers accused of staging a 'racist and homophobic' attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett says the men regret their involvement.

Gloria Schmidt represents Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo. She told reporters on Wednesday that the brothers agreed to help Smollett because of their friendship with him and the sense that he was helping them in their careers.

Schmidt says the Nigerian brothers have come to realize how much the incident has negatively affected minorities and particularly victims of actual hate crimes.

Smollett appeared in Leighton Criminal Court in Chicago on Tuesday to discuss whether cameras will be allowed in future proceedings of his trial.

He is charged with lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago. The actor allegedly paid the Osundairo brothers $3,500 to help him stage the attack.

The show, which is finishing it's fifth season on Fox, returned to the air on March 13 after a mid-season break.

Smollett, as result of his alleged actions, was written out of the last two episodes, including next week's season finale and could possibly be killed off the show, Variety reported.

110,1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tamerragriffin/samora-mangesi-south-africa-journalist-monkey-racist-attack,"Handout / Via Samora Mangesi South African broadcaster Samora Mangesi before and after his attack.

NAIROBI — A black South African news broadcaster says he was called a “monkey” and brutally beaten by a group of young white people when he tried to help them out of a car accident — but he hesitated to talk about it on social media after watching how the Jussie Smollett case has played out. Samora Mangesi, 26, tweeted graphic images of his injury on Wednesday despite those worries, and told BuzzFeed News that he has received a variety of responses ranging from shock and sympathy to chastisement for having tried to help white people as a black man in South Africa.

On Friday night I was the victim of a racially motivated attack. After stopping to check on a group of young white people whose car had overturned, they called my friends & I Monkeys. When we engaged them on why we were being called such, they beat me up until I was unconscious.

Mangesi, who hosts both radio and television shows for the South African Broadcasting Company, told BuzzFeed News by phone from Johannesburg that he had been driving with two of his women friends around 1:30 a.m. on Saturday when they noticed that a car had flipped over onto the side of the road. Although four of the five passengers had made it out of the vehicle, one man was still half-stuck inside of it with his legs dangling out, Mangesi said. They all appeared to be in their early twenties.

“We asked if they were OK, if they needed us to call the cops, or to call a friend,” Mangesi said. “First reaction we got was them saying, ‘Go [away], monkeys,’ in Afrikaans.” He said they also called his friends “black bitches.” Mangesi was shocked. Though he was under no illusions that racism had been eradicated in South Africa despite it being nearly 25 years since apartheid, he had never been called a monkey or any other racial epithet before. He said his immediate reaction was to just talk. “We said, ‘But guys, we’re only trying to help you. Why are you calling us monkeys, using derogatory terms?’” Mangesi recalled. “We were telling them how, in 2019, you can’t call people monkeys, especially black people, given this country’s history.” Because the exchange got heated, Mangesi didn’t notice when someone else, who he now believes was a friend of the people in the car, came up behind him and hit him in the head with an unknown object. It’s the last thing he remembers before he lost consciousness and woke up in a nearby hospital. “I remember crying my eyes out as I went into the CT scan,” he said. “There was concern that I might have internal bleeding or some form of brain damage.” He was relieved to find out later that his injuries were surface-level: multiple cuts on his face and inside of his mouth, a giant gash on his forehead, and bruising down the left side of his body. Neither of the two friends who were with him were harmed.

I sustained injuries on my face, cuts inside my mouth and bruising along the left side of my body from when they kicked me on the ground after one of them had hit me on the back of the head. According to EMS I was out for about 5 min and only regained consciousness in the ambi.

As a public figure with more than 14,000 followers on Twitter, Mangesi was initially unsure about whether he should disclose what happened to him on social media, or even to report it to the police.

“I played with the idea of not reporting it, trying to stay away from turning this into a big media thing and becoming a poster child for racism in South Africa,” he said. “Especially after what we’ve seen with Jussie Smollett in America, I didn’t want that attention.” Mangesi was referring to the Empire actor’s claim that he had been the victim of a hate crime carried out by two men who allegedly yelled racist and anti-gay insults at him, poured a chemical substance on him, and put a rope around his neck one January night in Chicago. Since then, Chicago police have produced evidence suggesting that Smollett had orchestrated the attack. Last month, Smollett was charged with falsely filing a police report, which expanded to 16 felony counts when a grand jury indicted him on March 9. Smollett has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. But Mangesi said he wasn’t trying to imply that people would question the validity of his story. He was worried that, like Smollett, his entire career would be reduced to what happened to him one night.

CHICAGO — After being contacted by a former senior Obama administration official, the Chicago-area's top prosecutor last month requested that the city police turn over their investigation of an alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett to the FBI, according to texts and emails released by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. Tina Tchen, who worked as former first lady Michelle Obama's chief of staff during her time in the White House, first contacted Kim Foxx by text on Feb. 1 and said the actor's family had ""concerns"" about the investigation, according to the communications.

That's corrupt as heck. The political muscling of the Chicago cops (led by a black police chief, no less) from the Obama machinery suggests that the Obamas knew that the case was fraudy (much as the rest of us suspected from the start, given the odd circumstances of the claimed racial/anti-gay attack, in polar vortex weather, late at night, in left-wing Chicago), and thought their buddies in the FBI would do a better job of covering for them, keeping the case alive. Those are the same FBI buddies who allowed Hillary Clinton to be questioned by FBI agents over her illegal private server with aides complicit in the act serving as lawyers (unprecedented) and the foofaraw about the case against her opening and shutting a couple times, each without incident. The same FBI that employed the likes of FBI lovebirds Peter Strzok and Lisa Page to cook up that ""insurance plan"" against the election of President Trump. There's no doubt that that Obamified agency has political players more interested in politics than law enforcement.

And the Chicago cops did a credible job blowing apart the scam and charging Smollett with filing false police reports and other crimes. Did Michelle Obama know that this was coming, and did her minion seek to protect him? Smollett is a politically connected actor, given his mom's friendship with Angela Davis and other famous lefties. Did Michelle Obama want to keep the phony narrative going, about Smollett being the victim, for his sake and to whip up power for the Obama political machine, which thrives on this kind of divisive politics? Well, Obama himself sure did, given his behavior during another fraudy racial case - in Ferguson. So right now, that's what it sounds like.

Two days ago, another charge of Michelle Obama's aides meddling in racial issues, trying to whip up rage, came from Roseanne Barr, so that's a pretty interesting pattern. Here's what the now fired star of the popular sitcom had to say just this week:

""She (Michelle) said, 'This tweet is unforgivable',"" the disgraced actress said in an interview with The Sunday Times Magazine. ""That's what I was told and I tend to believe it because the woman who fired me is now working with the Obamas at Netflix."" Barr appeared to be referring to former ABC Entertainment president, Channing Dungey, who has since been hired by Netflix to work on original programming, including content from the Obamas' Higher Ground Productions.

So we've got Obama aides meddling in the Chicago hate crime hoax and we've got Obama aides meddling in which television star should be seen...

They do seem to be all over the place. Here's another one, which might just be cut from the same cloth:

A former Georgetown University tennis coach who at one time was the instructor of First Lady Michelle Obama and her daughters was among the 50 people indicted this morning in a sweeping college admissions scandal. The bribery scheme, which allegedly also involved actresses Lori Laughlin and Felicity Huffman, entailed getting students admitted to some of the top schools in the country as recruited athletes - regardless of athletic ability - and helping those applicants cheat on their entrance exams. Gordon Ernst, who until last year was employed as the head coach of men's and women's tennis at Georgetown, was named in the bombshell indictment, along with long-time Yale women's soccer coach Rudy Meredith.

He, too, was an Obama aide of sorts, but the very radioactivity of the charges against him hasn't led to quite the bid to step forward of other aides as has the other two cases.

But cripes, it stinks of corruption, too. Was this guy involved in making tennis recommendations for Malia Obama to get into Harvard? Admittedly, she had a lot of legs up — as a legacy kid, and the daughter of a president, and who knows, might have been a good student, although her public pot-smoking suggests otherwise. But the fact that this guy is even in the picture, and the reality that Operation Varsity Blues showing the cheating of the elites to get into elite colleges, was likely just the tip of the iceberg to show how the elites rig the system, and signals yet another ethics-challenged person in the Obama circle.

They're ethics-challenged, and they have a propensity to interfere.

One can only hope that more facts come out on this one.

The pattern with the Obama flunkies still operating as if there were no end to the Obama presidency is starting to get pretty clear.

On Tuesday, Jussie had made his first court appearance, which he didn’t need to attend. After a hearing, his lawyer Tina Glandian said, “There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that's been presented as fact and evidence against Mr. Smollett that is demonstrably false. We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that members of the media can see the actual evidence — and what we feel is actually going to be a lack of evidence — against Mr. Smollett. And we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out.""

Smollett will be back in court in April. In the meantime, he will be able to travel to Los Angeles and New York to meet with his legal team, but must inform the court two days before traveling to either place.

Earlier this week, a lawyer for the other two men involved in the scandal spoke on their behalf. Gloria Schmidt, who is representing Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo in the case, argued on “Good Morning America” that they “were just taken advantage of by someone they trusted,” adding, “This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career… Someone they had trusted to consider their best interest.”

When asked if it was a fake attack, Schmidt said, “I’m confident that they did not do a hate crime.” She added, “They’re working very hard right now to piece their lives together… They know that this has impacted a lot of minority populations, so they’re working very hard to just move this in a positive direction.”

Last week, Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct-false report.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has pleaded not guilty to charges of filing false police reports relating to a hate crime attack.

Smollett’s lawyer Tina Glandian entered the not guilty plea at Cook County Circuit Court on Thursday (March 14).

He is facing 16 felony counts after claiming in January that he was the victim of a homophobic and racist attack.

Jussie Smollett ‘determined’ to prove innocence

Chicago police have accused him of perpetrating the attack on himself with two associates, but the gay actor continues to maintain his innocence.

The court assigned Judge Steven Watkins to oversee the case, with the first court date set for April 17.

The actor, who has been suspended from his Empire role, attended court in-person on Tuesday (March 12) “to show confidence in his innocence.”

His spokesperson Anne Kavanagh told NBC: “He will do everything he needs to do. He will go the extra mile to cooperate with the process.”

Neither Smollett’s lawyers nor prosecutors objected to cameras being allowed in court during the trial.

Glandian claimed that “demonstrably false” information was being spread about the case, adding: “We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is actually going to be the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett.

“We look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out.”

Jussie Smollett lawyers claims star is ‘victim of media gangbang’

Another of Smollett’s legal representatives recently said the star was a victim of “media gangbang.”

Speaking to CNN’s Anderson Cooper following the March 8 indictment, lawyer Mark Geragos said: “What is happening here is, frankly, a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions.

“I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case has.

“It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty.”

Geragos attacked the “overkill” decision to file a total of 16 felony counts, which could carry a lengthy prison time, and referenced an ongoing probe within the Chicago Police Department over the leaking of false information relating to the case.

The lawyer also questioned why no charges had been brought against brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, who claim that Smollett paid them $3,500 to fake the attack.

Records suggest that the money was in fact a personal training fee.

He said: “If you believe what the police chief is saying, they’ve got a great case against the two brothers.

“They’ve got Lyft receipts, they’ve got ATM receipts, they’ve got a surveillance video, but what do they have that corroborates the story [about Jussie]?

CBS Chicago reports: “After Smollett pleaded not guilty, Cook County Judge Steven Watkins granted him permission to travel to New York and California to consult with his attorneys, if he provides 48 hours notice to the court’s pretrial services office. Smollett is free on bail, and Watkins admonished the actor to be present an on-time for all of his upcoming court dates. Smollett’s next hearing was scheduled for April 17.”

“The specific allegations–“false report of offense”– are Class 4 felonies,” CBS Chicago reported. “The indictment expands the case against the actor. The counts focus on allegedly false statements he made to two different Chicago Police officers. Each count covers various alleged acts that Smollett falsely described to the officers–including that he was hit by two men, that they yelled racial and homophobic slurs and poured a chemical on him.”

Anderson Cooper spoke with Smollett’s attorney Mark Geragos last week about the 16-count felony indictment against the Empire actor for staging a hate crime.

Said Geragos: “This is an outrage….I defy anybody to find any indictment anywhere where somebody has brought 16 counts for being a victim of a hate crime, basically.”

“They have not talked to one person at Fox who has said he was dissatisfied with his money,” Geragos continued. “They have not interviewed one person connected with the show Empirewho says he was dissatisfied with his money. They are the ones who started their internal investigation about the leaks because all of the information that was being leaked was false.”

Added Geragos: “What is happening here is frankly a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions. And that’s the reason I got into this.

Anderson then asked why the brothers would do such a thing: “Doesn’t it just seem weird to you that you get allegedly attacked by two people who you know and you don’t seem to recognize them, even you claimed you fought back and they ran away, and — I believe initially Mr. Smollett said one of them was white, or they were white — Isn’t it just weird that you get allegedly attacked by two people you actually know that have been on Empire that, who you have actually worked out with, and you don’t recognize them?”

“Yes,” replied Geragos. “I don’t know whether he made that statement but what I do know is that when he was told that they had evidence against these two he refused to sign the complaint because he could not believe it.”

Added Geragos: “I haven’t seen one piece of evidence and they don’t have one piece of evidence that they’ve turned over that links Jussie to this.

Records: Former Michelle Obama Aide, Smollett Relative Reached Out to (Prosecutor) Kim Foxx

The Chicago Sun-Times ^ | March 14, 2019 | Andy Grimm

Posted on by PBRCat

Jussie Smollett told Chicago police he had fought off a pair of attackers who targeted him in an apparent hate crime, Cook County States Attorney Kim Foxx tried to persuade Police Supt. Eddie Johnson to turn the investigation over to the FBI.

Foxxs call came after an influential supporter of the Empire actor reached out to Foxx personally: Tina Tchen, a Chicago attorney and former chief of staff for Michelle Obama, according to emails and text messages provided to the Chicago Sun-Times in response to a public records request.

Tchen passed Foxxs number to a relative of the actor, and the conversations with the family member were cited by Foxx last month as the reason she recused herself from Smolletts prosecution as the actor faces disorderly conduct charges for allegedly making a false police report.

Text messages show Tchen contacted Foxx on Feb. 1, three days after Smollett said he was jumped by two men as he walked home from a sandwich shop near his Streeterville home. Tchen texted Foxx to set up an early morning phone call.

I wanted to give you a call on behalf of Jussie Smollett and family who I know. They have concerns about the investigation, Tchen wrote in a text sent before 5 a.m., seeking to set up a call with Foxx before Tchen left on an 8 a.m. flight to New York.

A few hours later, Foxx received a text from a relative of Smollett, who said shed received the number from Tchen.

In an interview, Foxx said that the family member expressed concerns about leaked information about the investigation  information that media outlets attributed to police sources.

They had no doubt about the quality of the investigation, but believed that the FBI would have a tighter lid on information, said Foxx.

The whole thing stinks to high heaven. In addition to the Smollett scam to secure a larger salary from the television series producers and, perhaps, keep himself employed as a regular character on the program, it also looks as if politicians were looking to cash in on the publicity to pass legislation. US Senators Booker and Harris look as if they were on the Jussie bandwagon until he was exposed as a fraudster who staged a faked hate crime.

CHICAGO -- ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty to multiple charges of disorderly conduct Thursday morning.

Cameras were rolling as Lawyer Tina Glandian entered the plea on behalf of the 36-year-old actor during a hearing in Cook County Circuit Court at 26th and California.

Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to oversee the case, including the trial.

Watkins granted Smollett's request to be allowed to meet with lawyers in New York and California, but said the actor must give the court at least 48 hours' prior notice. He scheduled the next hearing for April 17.

Smollett is charged with lying to Chicago police about the January attack in the city's Streeterville neighborhood.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

A grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false report.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack and maintains he is innocent.

An attorney for the Osundairo brothers, Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"", has said a $3500 check the actor gave the brothers was for both personal training and to stage an attack.

The brothers are not facing charges.

State's Attorney Kim Foxx has asked Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson to turn the case over to the FBI.

A spokesperson for Foxx says the request was made over concerns about leaks to the media.

Former Michelle Obama aide tried to intervene in Jussie Smollett probe

NY Post ^ | March 14, 2019 | Yaron Steinbuch

Posted on by COUNTrecount

After being contacted by a Chicago attorney who served as former first lady Michelle Obamas chief of staff, the top prosecutor in Cook County asked the citys top cop to turn over the Jussie Smollett probe to the FBI, according to reports.

Cook County States Attorney Kim Foxx reached out to Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson after Tina Tchen, the former senior Obama official, emailed the prosecutor saying the Empire actors family had concerns about the probe, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

Tchen passed Foxxs number to a family member of Smollett, and the ensuing conversations with the relative were later cited by the prosecutor as the reason she recused herself from the probe, according to the paper, which obtained messages from Foxx in response to a public records request.

Text messages show Tchen contacted Foxx on Feb. 1, three days after Smollett reported that he was attacked by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him and put his neck in a noose.

Tchen, a close friend of Mayor Rahm Emanuels wife, sent a text message to Foxx to set up an early morning phone call, according to the newspaper.

I wanted to give you a call on behalf of Jussie Smollett and family who I know. They have concerns about the investigation, texted Tchen, who sought to set up a call with Foxx before flying out to New York at 8 a.m.

""After being contacted by a Chicago attorney who served as former first lady Michelle Obamas chief of staff, the top prosecutor in Cook County asked the citys top cop to turn over the Jussie Smollett probe to the FBI, according to reports."" Given the last 2 years, why does this make me suspect that the Obamas still have personnel in the FBI who would have buried any incriminating evidence against Smollett to maintain ""the narrative""?

The prosecutor is clearly worried about the legal implications to her of having been told to hand off the job, so thats why shes bringing it out. However, at the time, Id say she didnt want to go into it anyway, because everybody in their right mind knew that Smollett was lying. She didnt want to have to be the one to be blamed for saying it. This is assuming she was planning on doing an honest investigation, which is by no means certain. But she just wanted out and Im sure she was happy to be told to hand it off.

“Empire” fans watched as the specter of considerable legal trouble hangs over Smollett’s head for allegedly hiring two Nigerian brothers to stage a hate crime against him.

Last week, Smollett, 36, was indicted on 16 felony counts by a grand jury after being charged with felony disorderly conduct for making a false report in January.

Smollett continues to proclaim his innocence and his legal team called the Cook County District Attorney’s Office’s actions a case of “prosecutorial overkill” and “vindictive.”

Rolling out has already reported that Smollett’s role will be written out of the show’s final two episodes. There are also reports floating about that Smollett’s “Empire” days are numbered and that he will either be killed off next season or his character will be recast.

It was serendipitous that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyons, had this to say on the latest episode of “Empire” regarding the Lyons’ family drama:

“I don’t know if y’all been reading the blogs and all the foolishness, but it’s kinda been a tough week,” Jamal said.

Twitter ate up the irony.

“LeeDaniels is a psychic,” one fan tweeted about “Empire’s” creator.

“Jussie Smollett watching #Empire right now,” tweeted another.

“I’m sorry it’s so hard for me to look at jussie without wanting to slap the s— outta him #Empire,” a viewer wrote.

“I’m just ready to see them write off Jamal #Empire,” a fan tweeted, alongside a gif of a woman giving a glare.

“It’s been a tough week” …hahaha more like a month so far, Jussie 😂#Empire,” another wrote.

It will not be an easy task for writers to construct a believable way to kill off his character if that’s how Fox wants to play it, but fans tuned in for last night’s return and had a lot to say:

Foxx wanted FBI involved in Smollett investigation: Texts, emails show she asked to turn over probe

The Chicago Tribune ^ | March14, 2019 | Megan Crepau, Jeremy Gormer

Posted on by PBRCat

At the urging of a politically connected lawyer, States Attorney Kimberly Foxx asked Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson to turn over the investigation of Jussie Smolletts reported attack to the FBI, according to communications provided to the Tribune.

Foxx reached out to Johnson after Tina Tchen, former chief of staff to first lady Michelle Obama, texted Foxx saying the actors family had unspecified concerns about the investigation. Tchen, a close friend of Mayor Rahm Emanuels wife, said she was acting on behalf of the Empire actor and his family. A relative later exchanged texts with Foxx.

The exchanges began Feb. 1, three days after Smollett claimed two men approached him near his Streeterville apartment building, yelled racists and homophobic slurs, hit him and put noose after his neck. It would still be 2½ weeks before he was charged with making the story up, but some media outlets were already starting to question the actors account, citing unnamed police sources.

Spoke to the Superintendent Johnson, Foxx emailed Tchen back on Feb. 1. I convinced him to Reach out to FBI to ask that they take over the investigation.

The same day, Foxx texted with Smolletts relative, whose name was blacked out in copies released by her office.

Spoke to the superintendent earlier, he made the ask, Foxx wrote. Trying to figure out logistics. Ill keep you posted.

Omg this would be a huge victory, the relative replied.

I make no guarantees, but Im trying, Foxx wrote back.

To: SharpRightTurn

Absolutely. I tell you, what surprised the hell out of me about this whole thing was not that his “attack” was a hoax - I think that was pretty obvious - but that they actually charged him! Especially since he held 3 cards: The race card, the gay card, and the democrap card. Getting charged just doesn’t happen today to people holding that many cards. As we have seen many times, just holding the democrap card is enough to get a criminal act buried. I was certain that cops would say the “investigation” is ongoing, that the treason media would ignore it, then it would all be brushed under the rug ala Al Sharpton and the Tawana Brawley case and probably even brought out from time to time as “proof” of racist Trump supporters. But that didn’t happen. Smollett must have ticked off someone really bad in the Rat party, maybe their commander Hillary.

Jussie Smollett appeared in a Chicago court on Thursday, where he pleaded not guilty to 16 counts of lying to police and filing a false police report.

According to TMZ, Judge Steven Watkins told Smollett he needs to be in attendance for every court appearance going forward, beginning with his next hearing in April. Smollett will be allowed to travel to Los Angeles and New York for work, but he must notify the court in advance of his travels.



The 36-year-old Empire actor is accused of orchestrating his own attack with the assistance of Nigerian brothers and Empire extras Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo. Smollett initially told police that he was attacked by two men outside a Subway restaurant in Chicago during the early morning hours of January 29th. The 36-year-old actor, who is openly gay, described his assailants as white men wearing ski masks, who asked Smollett if he was “that f***ot Empire n*****?” before attacking him with a rope and bleach. As they fled the scene, Smollett claimed the the men yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

Police believe Smollett was dissatisfied with his salary on Empire and used the attack as a way to increase his notoriety in the industry.

Smollett was initially arrested in February and charged with felony disorderly conduct. Prosecutors later decide to up the number of charges because Smollett allegedly lied to police on two separate occasions. If convicted of all charges, he could face up to 64 years in prison (each count carries a maximum of four years behind bars).

Following his arrest, Smollett was cut from the final two episodes of Empire’s fifth season.",2019-03-14 16:06:04+00:00,Jussie Smollett pleads not guilty to charges he faked his own attack,['Alex Young'],"['chicago', 'charges', 'men', 'actor', 'smollett', 'court', 'faked', 'told', 'pleads', 'initially', 'attack', 'empire', 'jussie', 'guilty']",156

Records: Former Michelle Obama Aide, Smollett Relative Reached Out To Kim Foxx

Chicago Sun-Times ^ | March 13, 2019 | Andy Grimm

Posted on by Kenny Bania

Foxxs call to Johnson came after an influential supporter of the Empire actor reached out to Foxx personally: Tina Tchen, a Chicago attorney and former chief of staff for former First Lady Michelle Obama, according to emails and text messages provided by Foxx to the Chicago Sun-Times in response to a public records request.

In an interview with the Sun-Times this week, Foxx said that the family member expressed concerns about leaked information about the investigation  information that media outlets attributed to police sources.

They had no doubt about the quality of the investigation, but believed that the FBI would have a tighter lid on the information, said Foxx, adding that Johnson initially seemed receptive to the idea of turning the case over the FBI.

Smollett doesn’t seem to be the brightest bulb on the string if he did all of this on someone else’s say so. He’d really have to be dumb to go along with it though, because if he had help, they’ve left him spinning in the wind. No matter how he comes out at trial, he doesn’t have a career any longer because his “sit com” will have sailed without him! I’m just hoping he gets to experience “lessons” in “dropping the soap” in the Cook County slammer. Maybe his mother’s “good friend” Angela Davis can show him how to disappear.

The Chicago Tribune is now reporting that a former aide to Michelle Obama attempted to help Smollett. After Smollett initially reported his alleged attack to authorities, Tina Tchen reached out on Smollett’s behalf to Cook County State’s Attorney, Kim Foxx.

Tchen, a Chicago attorney and former chief of staff for former First Lady Michelle Obama, allegedly reached out to Foxx via text messages to have her persuade Police Supt. Eddie Johnson to turn the case over to the FBI.

Smollett’s family believed that the FBI would keep a tighter grip on the information and details surrounding the case. And they were right as it did not take long for important information to be leaked to the news media. Chicago police are currently doing an internal investigation to discover how those details made its way to the media.

Foxx spoke with Johnson about handing the case over to the FBI, but he never agreed to the suggestion. Although the FBI did assist in the investigation, the case has primarily been handled by Chicago police.

Weeks after it was revealed by Chicago police that Smollett allegedly planned his own attack, Foxx recused herself from the case.

Tchen has yet to release a statement about her alleged involvement.

Jussie Smollett, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx

Tchen, a Chicago-based attorney, reached out on Feb. 1 to Chicago's top prosecutor Kim Foxx - telling her that the ""Empire"" actor's family had ""concerns"" about the investigation.

Smollett was considered at the time to be the victim of an assault, however the actor was subsequently charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report in connection with a staged hate crime. Last week, a Chicago grand jury slapped Smollett with a 16 count indictment for lying to the police - to which he pleaded not guilty on Thursday.

""Spoke to the Superintendent Johnson,"" Foxx emailed Tchen on Feb. 1, in reference to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. ""I convinced him to Reach out to FBI to ask that they take over the investigation.""

Foxx also texted with one of Smollett's relatives whose name was redacted from the text release, saying: ""Spoke to the superintendent earlier, he made the ask ... Trying to figure out logistics. I’ll keep you posted.""

""OMG this would be a huge victory"" the family member texted back.

""I make no guarantees, but I'm trying"" replied Foxx - who recused herself from the case on Feb. 20.

Foxx recused herself from the investigation before Smollett was charged. Her first deputy, Joe Magats, is overseeing the case. Foxx said in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times that Smollett's family was concerned that aspects of the police investigation were being leaked to media. “They had no doubt about the quality of the investigation, but believed that the FBI would have a tighter lid on the information,” Foxx told the outlet. Anthony Guglielmi, the police department's chief spokesman, said Foxx conveyed the request to Johnson that Tchen and the Smollett family member wanted the FBI to take over the investigation. -USA Today

Guglielmi said that the case was not moved to the FBI because ""there was a lack of evidence"" that Smollett was the victim of a federal hate crime.

""There was no federal jurisdiction,"" said Guglielmi, who added that the FBI has been assisting the police investigation. ""If there was ever a point where they felt it was within federal jurisdiction, it would have easily gone there.""

Smollett claimed that he was the victim of a predawn hate crime on January 29 in which two men assaulted him while he was on his way home after buying a sandwich; hurling racial and antigay slurs at him, dousing him in a liquid, placing a noose around his neck (which he was still wearing when police arrived later that morning), and punching him in the face.

Police allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, staged a Jan 29 homophobic, racist attack because he was unhappy with his salary to boost his profile.

The incident sparked national outrage - with the left-leaning mainstream media and prominent Democrats uncritically supporting Smollett's version of events; holding it up as a prime example of violent Donald Trump supporters.

Two suspects in the case, Nigerian-American brothers Ola and Abel Osundario - one of whom has been an extra on Empire, told police that Smollett paid them a combined $3,500 to stage the ""attack,"" and that the three of them had practiced it beforehand. They also said that Smollett was involved in creating a racist letter containing a white substance that was sent to the actor on the Chicago set of Empire.

When the letter failed to achieve the desired level of national outrage, the Osundario brothers say Smollett concocted the hate-crime.",2019-03-14 00:00:00,Ex-Obama Official Tried Pulling Strings To Have Smollett Case Transferred To FBI; Told To Pound Sand,[],"['pulling', 'transferred', 'chicago', 'victim', 'tchen', 'superintendent', 'official', 'smollett', 'fbi', 'sand', 'investigation', 'told', 'tried', 'foxx', 'pound', 'strings', 'case', 'family']",160

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett told Chicago police in January that two men physically attacked him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 22

— Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox TV show, receives a racist and homophobic threatening letter at the Chicago studio where “Empire” is filmed. Police later say that they believe Smollett sent the letter himself.

Jan. 29

— Smollett tells police he was attacked by two masked men in downtown Chicago while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at 2 a.m. He says the men beat him, used racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown substance on him and wrapped a noose around his neck before fleeing. Police say Smollett also told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. They say he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing accusations leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett, who is also an R&B singer, gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech in which he said he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search their apartment.

Feb. 14

— Police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. Guglielmi says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after the questioning of the two brothers and that they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

Feb. 19

— Police investigate a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator at his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution ... to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” Foxx later says the reason for the recusal is that she had conversations with a Smollett family member after the incident was reported in late January.

Feb. 20

— Police say Smollett is officially suspected of filing a false police report by claiming he was attacked and that a grand jury was being presented with evidence from detectives and hearing testimony from the two brothers.

— Police say the Cook County State’s Attorney has charged Smollett with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report and that detectives had reached out to Smollett’s attorneys to arrange his surrender.

Feb. 21

— Police say Smollett turned himself in to face a felony charge of disorderly conduct, which could bring up to three years in prison.

— Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett staged the attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted publicity to further his career. Investigators say they have a $3,500 check that Smollett used to pay the brothers to help him.

Feb. 22

— Producers of “Empire” say Jussie Smollett’s character will be removed from the final two episodes of this season.

March 7

— The grand jury returns a 16-count indictment charging Smollett with filing a false police report.

March 14

— Smollett pleads not guilty during a hearing in which Judge Steven Watkins is assigned to oversee the case, including the trial.

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges accusing him of lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in downtown Chicago a few weeks ago.

Lawyer Tina Glandian entered the plea on behalf of the 36-year-old actor during a hearing in Cook County Circuit Court after Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to oversee the case, including the trial.

Watkins granted Smollett’s request to be allowed to meet with lawyers in New York and California, but said the actor must give the court at least 48 hours’ prior notice. He scheduled the next hearing for April 17.

Smollett, who left the courthouse without speaking to reporters, is charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show, hired two friends to help him stage the attack on him in downtown Chicago early on the morning of Jan. 29. They say Smollett was unhappy about his salary and wanted to drum up publicity to help his career.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack and maintains he is innocent. His attorneys have called the charges against him “prosecutorial overkill.”

There were several supporters outside the courthouse doors as Smollett arrived for the hearing, including some who waved signs. Activist Wisdom Cole led a few chants in support of the actor, the black community and the LGBT community.

“Jussie has been a person of high caliber and character. He comes from an activist family. He has a consistent track record and history of supporting marginalized people ... and so his track record is not on par with the idea of a hoax,” she said.

1 Mob shooting: The reputed boss of New York’s Gambino crime family was gunned down outside his home, dying a virtual unknown compared with his swaggering 1980s-era predecessor, the custom-tailored tabloid regular John Gotti. Francesco “Franky Boy” Cali, 53, was found with multiple gunshot wounds at his red-brick colonial-style house on Staten Island on Wednesday night and was pronounced dead at a hospital. No immediate arrests were made. The Gambino family was once among the most powerful criminal organizations in the U.S., but federal prosecutions in the 1980s and 1990s sent Gotti and other top leaders to prison, diminishing its reach. The last Mafia boss to be shot to death in New York City was Gambino don Paul Castellano, assassinated outside a Manhattan steak house in 1985 at the direction of Gotti, who then took over.

2 Groundwater pollution: Facing billions of dollars in cleanup costs, the Pentagon is pushing the Trump administration to adopt a weaker standard for groundwater pollution caused by chemicals that have commonly been used at military bases and that contaminate drinking water consumed by millions of Americans. The Pentagon’s position pits it against the Environmental Protection Agency, which is seeking White House sign off for standards that would most likely require expensive cleanup programs at scores of military bases, as well as at NASA launch sites, airports and some manufacturing facilities. Despite its record of deregulation under President Trump, the EPA has been seeking to stick with a tougher standard for the presence of the chemicals in question in the face of the pressure from the military to adopt a far looser framework.

4 “Apprentice” lawsuit: A New York appeals court has ruled that President Trump isn’t immune from a defamation lawsuit filed by a former “Apprentice” contestant who accused him of unwanted kissing and groping. A state Supreme Court Appellate Division panel issued its ruling Thursday in a case brought by Summer Zervos. The decision lets Zervos’ suit proceed and increases the prospect that Trump could have to sit for sworn questioning. Zervos was among over a dozen women who emerged during Trump’s 2016 campaign with allegations of sexual misconduct years earlier. He called the women liars. Trump’s lawyers have said the case shouldn’t go forward while he’s in office.

5 Stone trial: Trump confidant Roger Stone will go on trial Nov. 5 in Washington D.C. on charges he lied to Congress, engaged in witness tampering and obstructed a congressional investigation into possible coordination between Russia and Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, a federal judge said Thursday. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Stone’s trial will take about two weeks. She is still considering whether the self-described dirty trickster violated a court order that prohibits him from discussing his criminal case with an introduction to his new book that criticizes special counsel Robert Mueller, whose office is prosecuting Stone. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

The 36-year-old actor was dropped from the final two episodes of the current fifth season of the musical family drama after he was charged for allegedly staging a faked racist and homophobic attack on himself. Showrunner Brett Mahoney insists a final decision on whether he will be back as Jamal Lyon, doesn’t need to be made this early in the legal process.

He said, “It’s a matter of trusting the process and allowing the legal process to play out and see where it goes from there. And it’s too early to think about what we would have to do if we didn’t have Jussie.

“We have such a strong ensemble and we have so many stories to tell for all of these fascinating characters that it’s bigger than one character, but it’s too early to think about the show without him.”

However, the executive producer felt making the “difficult decision” to drop Jussie from the final weeks of filming was the best thing to do, both to allow him to focus on his legal battle and his co-stars to focus on the show without any “disruption” or stress.

He explained to Entertainment Weekly, “It was a very difficult decision, but I think in terms of allowing the cast and the crew to really get the work done without a great deal of disruption in terms of the day-to-day and the stress of the day-to-day, and, in addition, allowing Jussie the time to really deal with what he’s been confronted with and allow him the time to focus and prepare his case; this seems like the logical decision to make.”

Although it has been rumored the series faces cancellation should the actor be found guilty, Brett has reassured fans that he’s confident it will be picked up for another season.

He said, “I’m not surprised that we don’t necessarily have a pick up at this point as I think last season we waited until May.

“All the indications I have are that we will be. And we do have so many of these stories to tell, so I can’t imagine we won’t be able to tell them.”

The 36-year-old actor’s lawyer, Tina Glandian, entered the plea on Smollett’s behalf during a hearing in Cook County Circuit Court after Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to oversee the case, including the trial.

The next court date was scheduled for April 17th.

Smollett is charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

Prosecutors allege that the actor, who is black and gay, hired two friends to help stage an attack on him in downtown Chicago early on the morning of January 29th.

Police say Smollett told detectives that he was beaten by two masked men while they hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, and that they poured an unknown substance on him and hung a noose around his neck before fleeing.

Smollett has denied staging the attack and maintains his innocence.

Mr Justice Watkins granted Smollett’s request to be allowed to meet with lawyers in New York and California, but said the actor must give the court prior notice of at least 48 hours.

Jussie Smollett is pleading not guilty to the 16 charges stemming from his allegedly lying to police about being attacked in Chicago.

The Empire star was back in court on Thursday for his arraignment, where he revealed his stance.

It’s being said he will need to attend every court date from here on out, but is allowed to travel to Los Angeles and New York for meetings with his lawyers. He only needs to give the court 48 hours notice, but upon arrival back in Chicago, must check in within 24 hours.

Additionally, the actor will be back in court mid-April.

In case you missed it, the 36-year-old was indicted on 16 counts late last week for “false report of offense” — all class 4 felonies. If found guilty, he could be sent away to prison for years!

His attorney, Mark Geragos, released the following statement after the indictment:

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie…”

And Geragos continued:

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

This all started back in January, with Smollett claiming he was attacked late at night by two white men who recognized him from the hit FOX show. After hurling racist and homophobic slurs at him, his attackers allegedly beat him, even putting a noose around his neck.

Not much later, Chicago police revealed they had evidence pointing to the Hollywood star lying about the attack, accusing him of paying his “attackers,” all so he could get more attention and score a bigger salary from Empire.

They also shared that the two men who allegedly staged the attack with Smollett, Ola and Abel Osundairo (pictured below), are cooperating witnesses, and have since spoken out on the “hoax” via their lawyer.

Gloria Schmidt shared at the time:

“They worked with Jussie, they had known him, they were friends with him. This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position withFox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.”

She added:

“It’s unfortunately a very complicated relationship for them because if you are friends and I’m saying, ‘Hey, I am going to pay you for training, I am also asking you to do me a favor,’ … and the favor was to stage the attack.”

Jussie has not responded in return, and hasn’t publicly spoken out since his controversial Good Morning America interview with Robin Roberts.

We’ll continue to keep you updated as we’re sure we’ll be hearing more about the case ahead of his upcoming April court date.

A judge is expected to be assigned to Jussie Smollett’s disorderly conduct case when the Empire actor returns to court Thursday (March 14). That judge will then likely ask Smollett to enter a plea.

Smollett is accused of lying to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two men on Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago.

Hollywood elites are, by definition, in the business of concocting fictional stories.

Is it any surprise that they apply these skill sets beyond screen and stage entertainment, where the fiction is acknowledged, and use them to achieve their objectives in realms affecting their personal and political lives?

In both the college admissions scandal and the alleged hate crime fraud masterminded (I use the term very loosely) by Jussie Smollett, I find five other common points in addition to the first point of employing fiction:



Winter for the Ruling Class (Yale University; photo credit: Max Pixel).

Two: Powerful people from powerful families with no concern for issues of right and wrong tried to accomplish their goals ""by any means necessary."" Religion — the notion the God watches over us and knows when we sin — is regarded as a quaint vestige of the past and a hindrance to achieving necessary ends, both personal and political.

Three: Wealth enables payoffs. Most people cannot conceive of lavishing thousands of dollars, much less hundreds of thousands or even millions, on bribes because they earn their money through hard work. But such are the rewards of stardom or business success: once liberated from concerns over morality (see point two), there is no problem in offering whatever it takes ($3,500 for a couple of Nigerian brothers, or millions to a college official) to get the desired behavior.

Four: The notion that ""laws are for the little people"" is widespread, from Hillary Clinton's exoneration by James Comey (and, according to the recently released testimony of Lisa Page, the Department of Justice) to state and local level officials who escape mundane concerns such as speed limits.

Five: Utter indifference to the victims of their fraud. Jussie Smollett remained silent as the Chicago police investigated possible miscreants, who could well have had their lives ruined if prosecuted for the phony hate crime. I suspect that most of the parents and children admitted to elite schools never once thought about the hardworking kids who did not get the longed for acceptance letters these offenders got through fraud. They matter so little that they don't ever merit consideration when planning the crimes.

Six: Despite all of the above, virtue-signaling remains a favorite pastime. Smollett's now infamous interview with Robin Roberts was a nonstop festival of moral preening (as a victim), while at least some of the Hollywood and business elites implicated in the college admissions scandal used their wealth for ""donations"" to a tax-deductible foundation established by the consultant, while others donated directly to the universities.

I suspect there are other similarities between the two scandals, because they both reveal that our ruling class is far more corrupt and cynical than most Americans ever realized.

Note: I am indebted to my friend Mike Nadler for originally pointing out the comparison between the two scandals. But responsibility for any inadequacies and errors rests solely with me.",2019-03-14 00:00:00,Six Common Themes Unite The Jussie Smollett And College Admissions Scandals,[],"['admissions', 'suspect', 'common', 'unite', 'college', 'thousands', 'ruling', 'fraud', 'smollett', 'scandals', 'business', 'scandal', 'themes', 'wealth', 'jussie']",186

Photo courtesy Chicago Police Department/UPI | License Photo

March 14 (UPI) -- Actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges that say he staged a hate crime against himself and filed a fake police report in a bid to gain attention.

The Empire actor made the plea in Chicago court Thursday morning. He is is free on $100,000 bond and denies lying to police and faking the attack. Defense attorneys said the multiple counts are ""redundant and vindictive.""

A grand jury indicted Smollett last week on 16 counts of disorderly conduct related to a Jan. 29 incident in which the 36-year-old told police he was attacked by men who used racial and homophobic slurs in his Streeterville neighborhood in Chicago. At one point, Smollett, who is openly gay, said the men yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Police investigated the crime and later said Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 to stage the assault.

Cameras were allowed in the courtroom when Judge Steven Watkins was assigned the case but it's up to the judge whether cameras will be allowed for the trial itself.

""In light of the substantial amount of misinformation in the case, the defense actually welcomes cameras in the courtroom,"" Smollett attorney Tina Glandian said.

He will be allowed to travel to New York and California to meet with lawyers, as long as he notifies the court 48 hours ahead of time.",2019-03-14 00:00:00,Actor Jussie Smollett pleads not guilty to staging hate crime,['Nicholas Sakelaris'],"['chicago', 'neighborhood', 'men', 'pleaded', 'staging', 'actor', 'smollett', 'court', 'jussie', 'pleads', 'allowed', 'crime', 'hate', 'guilty']",188

While appearing in Cook County court on Thursday in Chicago, the 36-year-old Empire star pleaded not guilty to 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Earlier in the hearing, Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to the actor's case. Smollett, who is currently out on $100,000 bond, arrived to court with a group of people, donning a blue jacket and scarf with aviator sunglasses shielding his eyes.

This marks the latest development in a winding case that first began in late January when Smollett reported to police that he had been attacked in Chicago around 2 a.m.

""Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire,"" CPD Chief Spokesman Anthony Gugliemi told E! News at the time. ""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.

159,1,https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/8502525/empire-producer-cutting-jussie-smollett-final-episodes-season-5,"Smollett's character dealt with scurrilous blog rumors on Wednesday night's (March 13) series return.

Fox music drama Empire returned on Wednesday night (March 13) from a mid-season hiatus with the usual compliment of plot twists, heated arguments, snitches dangled from windows and palace intrigue swirling around the Lyon family. Unexpectedly at the center of the drama, despite modest screen time, was middle son Jamal Lyon (Jussie Smollett), who was dealing with some eerily familiar problems in the episode entitled ""My Fault is Past.""

Though the show was filmed weeks before Smollett became embroiled in some serious off-screen issues due to what Chicago police say was a faked hate crime attack in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29, eagle-eyed viewers likely could parse unintended, hidden meanings if they looked hard enough. In fact, Jamal's first scene included a lecture from mother Cookie Lyon (Taraji P. Henson), who snapped, ""The Lyons are Empire, you are Empire, so no matter what you think or how you feel about it, if it's tainted, we're all tainted,"" after Jamal demurred when asked to help his parents win back their imperiled musical kingdom.

Even more bizarre, when youngest brother Hakeem proposed roughing up the sibling's newly discovered stepbrother from another mother, Smollett's Jamal says, ""We ain't gonna beat nobody's ass,"" another odd parallel considering Smollett is accused of paying two men -- one of whom he's worked with on Empire -- to beat him up in the alleged Chicago attack.

The series' return comes amid the cloud of negative headlines about Smollett's case -- the actor was due in court on Thursday (March 14) for a hearing -- with executive producer Brett Mahoney telling E! News that the decision to drop him from the final two episodes of the fifth season was not an easy one. ""It was a very difficult decision, but I think in terms of allowing the cast and the crew to really get the work done without a great deal of disruption in terms of the day-to-day and the stress of the day-to-day, and, in addition, allowing Jussie the time to really deal with what he's been confronted with and allow him the time to focus and prepare his case, this seems like the logical decision to make,"" Mahoney said.

After initially voicing their full support for Smollett, who claimed the two then-identified men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him before an attack in which they allegedly poured bleach on him, put a piece of rope on his neck and roughed him up, the producers changed their minds after the actor was arrested and charged with filing a false police report.

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,"" the show's producers said in a statement following Smollett's arrest. ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""

Mahoney told E! that producers are now waiting to see how Smollett's legal issues work out before deciding the fate of his character. ""It's a matter of trusting the process and allowing the legal process to play out and see where it goes from there,"" he said. ""And it's too early to think about what we would have to do if we didn't have Jussie. We have such a strong ensemble and we have so many stories to tell for all of these fascinating characters that it's bigger than one character, but it's too early to think about the show without him.""

Though Empire has has not yet officially been renewed for a sixth season, Mahoney said he's confident that Fox stands behind the series. ""I know that the network and studio is really happy with what we've done creatively this season,"" he said. ""I'm not surprised that we don't necessarily have a pick up at this point as I think last season we waited until May. All the indications I have are that we will be. And we do have so many of these stories to tell, so I can't imagine we won't be able to tell them.""

Not to put too fine a point on it, but on Wednesday night's episode Jamal returns to the stage to perform a high-energy track for some high school students and addresses his family's very public drama in his first show since the family's dirty laundry was aired; Smollett performed an emotional show just days after the alleged attack. ""I don't know if ya'll been reading the blogs and all that foolishness,"" Jamal Lyon says. ""But it's kind of been a tough week, so I had to come home to my own high school...stick together!""",,'Empire' Producer Says Cutting Jussie Smollett From Final Season 5 Episodes Was 'A Very Difficult Decision',['Gil Kaufman'],"['difficult', 'season', 'jamal', 'cutting', 'smolletts', 'decision', 'process', 'final', 'lyon', 'work', 'smollett', 'producer', 'episodes', 'think', 'empire', 'jussie']",190

Smollett was indicted by a Cook County grand jury on those 16 felony counts last week after being accused of lying to police regarding a Jan. 29 incident, in which he said he was randomly attacked by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs in his Chicago neighborhood.

The “Empire” star was originally charged with one felony count for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office last month.

Judge Steven Watkins has been assigned to preside over Smollett’s case, with the actor set to return to court on April 17, according to CBS Chicago.

Representatives for Smollett and a spokesperson for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for confirmation.

Smollett surrendered himself to Chicago police on Feb. 21, hours after he was formally charged. He was released from police custody later that afternoon, after posting bail and surrendering his passport following a bond hearing.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” Smollett’s team said in a statement that day. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Within hours of his release from police custody, Smollett returned to work on the set of “Empire.” However, the following day, executive producers announced that they had decided to remove the actor — who plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon — from the final two episodes of the show’s current season.

During a press conference last month, hours after Smollett’s surrender on Feb. 21, Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that the actor staged an attack on himself because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.” He also told reporters the police were in possession of a $3,500 check, which he said Smollett used to pay brothers Olabinjo (“Ola”) and Abimbola (“Abel”) Osundairo for the incident.

The Osundairos were released without charges Feb. 15, following an arrest and 48-hour hold, after the police said “new evidence” had emerged and that the investigation’s “trajectory” had changed course.

164,1,https://www.thewrap.com/osundairo-brothers-lawyer-jussie-smollett-check/,"Gloria Schmidt, the lawyer representing the two brothers “Empire” star Jussie Smollett is accused of hiring to stage an attack against him, says a key piece of evidence is “more nuanced” than many people realize.

Smollett’s $3,500 check to Abimbola Osundairo says in the memo line that it was for “5 Week Nutrition/Workout Program (Don’t Go),” according to a copy received by ABC News. (“Don’t Go” is the name of a song Smollett says he was getting ready to shoot a music video for.)

Chicago police, however, said the check was payment for Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo to attack Smollett on Jan. 29.

But Schmidt told TheWrap on Wednesday that the check was for both the attack and the training.

“The idea of them getting paid by Jussie for the training actually occurred before… this Jan. 29 thing happened,” she said. “When he went to pay them, was when he [asked] for this favor.”

“So it’s like a wink-wink, nudge-nudge, ‘Can you do this for me?'” Schmidt said. “‘Here’s payment for the other thing we talked about.'”

Asked if she knows how much of the money was for training and how much was for the attack, she said she had never though of it in “that binary way.”

The Osundairo brothers were taken into custody by Chicago police after the attack but were released after two days and have not been charged with any crimes. Schmidt said her clients have “fully cooperated” and will still “fully cooperate” with the ongoing case, adding that she does not believe them to be in legal jeopardy.

“Are they in legal peril? Am I nervous for them? No,” she said. “You only need immunity when you’re facing unrelated charges on things … No promises were made, no deals were cut. They wanted to be truth-tellers in the story.”

Smollett was indicted by a grand jury last week on 16 felony counts after allegedly lying to police about the incident, in which he said he was randomly attacked by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs in his Chicago neighborhood. The Osundario brothers are from the north side of Chicago.

Schmidt denied that that detail came from her client’s conversations with police. “[They] never once… touched on what was Jussie’s motive,” she said Wednesday. “My clients would not know what he was thinking or how far back he was planning something.”

It didn’t receive a warm welcome from viewers.

Last night’s 8 p.m. episode settled for a 1.3 demo rating/6 share among adults 18-49, and 4.412 million total viewers — those Nielsen numbers are way down from last year’s comparable hour and are even down double digits versus the hip-hop soap opera’s fall finale.

The previous original “Empire” episode on Dec. 5 had a 1.5 rating and 5.043 million total viewers. Last year’s midseason return put up a 2.0 rating and tallied 6.217 million viewers.

Wednesday’s hour was down 13 percent in both the demo and for the overall audience versus the fall finale, and down 35 percent in the demo and 29 percent in viewers from last year’s midseason premiere episode.

As a matter of fact, last night’s “Empire” drew the second-smallest audience and second-worst demo rating ever for “Empire.” The only episode to draw fewer “live” eyeballs (4.229 million) and a lower demo rating (a 1.2) aired on Halloween 2018, which makes sense, as people were out celebrating and not in front of their TVs.

That said, Fox and its regular abbreviated (compared with CBS, ABC and NBC) primetime schedule still finished first in key-demo averages, but it just barely edged ABC — with a different of 17,000 viewers — for third in terms of total viewers. NBC aired all reruns last night and still landed a bigger audience than both of those nets.

Fox was first in ratings with a 1.2 rating/5 share in the advertiser-coveted 18-49 demographic and third in total viewers with an average of 4.05 million, according to preliminary numbers. Following “Empire,” “Star” at 9 had a 1.1/5 and 3.7 million viewers.

Shortly after this set of Nielsen data came out, Smollett pleaded not guilty to 16 counts of disorderly conduct. Read all about that here.

CBS and ABC tied for second in ratings, both with a 0.9/4. CBS was first in total viewers with 5 million, ABC was fourth with 4.03 million.

For ABC, “The Goldbergs” at 8 had a 1.1/5 and 4.8 million viewers. At 8:30, “Schooled” got a 1.0/4 and 3.9 million viewers. “Modern Family” at 9 received a 1.2/5 and 4.6 million viewers. “Single Parents” at 9:30 closed the comedy block with a 0.8/4 and 3.4 million viewers. “Whiskey Cavalier” finished off primetime to a 0.6/3 and 3.7 million viewers.

Prosecutors allege that the actor, who is black and gay, hired two friends to help stage an attack on him in downtown Chicago early on the morning of January 29.

Police say Smollett told detectives that two masked men beat him while hurling racist and homophobic slurs, and that they poured an unknown substance on him and hung a noose around his neck before fleeing.

Smollett has denied staging the attack and maintains his innocence.

Judge Watkins granted Smollett’s request to be allowed to meet with lawyers in New York and California, but said the actor must give the court prior notice of at least 48 hours.

There were several supporters outside the court as Smollett arrived for the hearing, including some who waved signs.

The Fox drama on Wednesday aired its midseason premiere after being off the air for three months. Smollett, who claimed in January he was the victim of a hate crime but has since been charged with disorderly conduct as police say he paid to stage the attack, was featured in the episode as usual, although he will be removed from the show later in the season.

Ratings for the new episode fell significantly, with 4.4 million total viewers tuning in, per The Wrap. For comparison, about five million people tuned into the previous episode in December. This is also down from the 6.2 million people who watched the midseason premiere in 2018. The result was the second-worst rated Empire episode in the show's entire run, with the worst being one that aired on Halloween 2018 that drew an audience of 4.2 million viewers. Still, Empire was the second highest-rated primetime show on Wednesday night, Deadline points out.

Smollett appeared in a Chicago court on Thursday to plead not guilty to the 16 counts against him. His next court appearance will take place on April 17.

181,1,http://www.startribune.com/key-moments-in-the-case-against-actor-jussie-smollett/507143822/,"CHICAGO — ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett told Chicago police in January that two men physically attacked him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 22

— Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox TV show, receives a racist and homophobic threatening letter at the Chicago studio where ""Empire"" is filmed. Police later say that they believe Smollett sent the letter himself.

Jan. 29

— Smollett tells police he was attacked by two masked men in downtown Chicago while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at 2 a.m. He says the men beat him, used racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown substance on him and wrapped a noose around his neck before fleeing. Police say Smollett also told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Police say they've reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them ""persons of interest.""

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, ""It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.""

— Smollett's family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. They say he ""has told the police everything"" and ""his story has never changed,"" disputing accusations leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he's OK and thanking them for their support. He says he's working with authorities and has been ""100 percent factual and consistent on every level.""

Feb. 2

— Smollett, who is also an R&B singer, gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech in which he said he had to play the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren't sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on ""Empire."" Police question the brothers and search their apartment.

Feb. 14

— Police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

— Producers of ""Empire"" dispute media reports that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the two ""persons of interest"" are now considered suspects. He says the men are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. Guglielmi says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has ""shifted"" after the questioning of the two brothers and that they've requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett's lawyers say the actor feels ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault.

Feb. 19

— Police investigate a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator at his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it's not credible based on video evidence.

10 a.m.

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has pleaded not guilty to the charges accusing him of lying to police about being attacked in downtown Chicago a few weeks ago.

The 36-year-old actor's lawyer, Tina Glandian, entered the plea Thursday on Smollett's behalf after Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to oversee the case, including the trial. The next court date was scheduled for April 17.

Smollett is charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

Prosecutors allege that the actor, who is black and gay, hired two friends to help stage an attack on him in downtown Chicago early on the morning of Jan. 29. Police say Smollett told detectives that two masked men beat him while hurling racist and homophobic slurs, and that they poured an unknown substance on him and hung a noose around his neck before fleeing.

Smollett has denied staging the attack and maintains his innocence.

A judge is expected to be assigned to Jussie Smollett's disorderly conduct case when the ""Empire"" actor returns to court Thursday.

That judge will then likely ask Smollett to enter a plea.

Smollett is accused of lying to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two men on Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago.

The actor appeared in court earlier this week when prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed to allow cameras during Thursday's hearing.

186,1,http://www.thewrap.com/osundairo-brothers-lawyer-jussie-smollett-check/,"Gloria Schmidt, the lawyer representing the two brothers “Empire” star Jussie Smollett is accused of hiring to stage an attack against him, says a key piece of evidence is “more nuanced” than many people realize.

Smollett’s $3,500 check to Abimbola Osundairo says in the memo line that it was for “5 Week Nutrition/Workout Program (Don’t Go),” according to a copy received by ABC News. (“Don’t Go” is the name of a song Smollett says he was getting ready to shoot a music video for.)

Chicago police, however, said the check was payment for Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo to attack Smollett on Jan. 29.

But Schmidt told TheWrap on Wednesday that the check was for both the attack and the training.

“The idea of them getting paid by Jussie for the training actually occurred before… this Jan. 29 thing happened,” she said. “When he went to pay them, was when he [asked] for this favor.”

“So it’s like a wink-wink, nudge-nudge, ‘Can you do this for me?'” Schmidt said. “‘Here’s payment for the other thing we talked about.'”

Asked if she knows how much of the money was for training and how much was for the attack, she said she had never though of it in “that binary way.”

The Osundairo brothers were taken into custody by Chicago police after the attack but were released after two days and have not been charged with any crimes. Schmidt said her clients have “fully cooperated” and will still “fully cooperate” with the ongoing case, adding that she does not believe them to be in legal jeopardy.

“Are they in legal peril? Am I nervous for them? No,” she said. “You only need immunity when you’re facing unrelated charges on things … No promises were made, no deals were cut. They wanted to be truth-tellers in the story.”

Smollett was indicted by a grand jury last week on 16 felony counts after allegedly lying to police about the incident, in which he said he was randomly attacked by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs in his Chicago neighborhood. The Osundario brothers are from the north side of Chicago.

Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett staged the attack because he was displeased with his pay on the Fox hip-hop soap opera “Empire.”

Schmidt denied that that detail came from her client’s conversations with police. “[They] never once… touched on what was Jussie’s motive,” she said Wednesday. “My clients would not know what he was thinking or how far back he was planning something.”

NYPD Hate Crimes Unit Investigating Vile Defacing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg Poster in Brooklyn

Posted on by a little elbow grease

A subway poster advertising a commemorative book on Ruth Bader Ginsburg was defaced with anti-Semitic and other slurs.

The NYPD's hate crimes unit is investigating slur-ridden ""DIE"" graffiti scrawled on a Brooklyn subway station poster of Ruth Bader Ginsburg after a rider flagged it on Twitter Tuesday.

""What is going to be done about this?"" the rider captioned in her tweet, tagging the mayor's office, the MTA and NYPD among other accounts. She said it was spotted at the Nassau Avenue G train stop.

""DIE"" in all capital letters is scrawled in black marker across Ginsburg's forehead on the poster; ""JEW"" was written over her glasses, followed by another slur and a swastika over her mouth.

In a statement on Wednesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo denounced the graffiti.

""We will not stand by and allow hateful and discriminatory vandalism in New York,"" he said. ""I have directed the New York State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to provide the NYPD with any resources needed to assist in the investigation.""

Smollett's lawyer, Tina Glandian, entered the plea on Smollett’s behalf just hours after Judge Steven Watkins was assigned the case. The next court date was scheduled for April 17.

Smollett was initially charged with one count of lying to the authorities on Feb. 20. Last week, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts of lying to authorities — eight counts for what he told the officer who responded to the report of the Jan. 29 attack in downtown Chicago, and eight counts for what he later told a detective about being the victim of a brutal racist and homophobic beating by two masked men.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S ALLEGED CHICAGO ATTACK DETAILS UNFOLD: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the incident because he was unhappy with his salary on the Fox show and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, called the charges ""prosecutorial overkill"" in a statement last week.

The 36-year-old actor, who is free on $100,000 bond, has vehemently denied the allegations.

SMOLLETT'S 'EMPIRE' DAD TERRENCE HOWARD BREAKS SILENCE, DOUBLES DOWN ON SUPPORT

A week before the alleged attack, Smollett told authorities he received a threatening letter at work. Chicago police pushed back and accused Smollett of faking the letter as well.

Federal authorities are conducting a separate investigation into that letter.

Adding another plot twist to the Smollett saga is a new USA Today report that claims that, at the urging of a former senior Obama administration official, Chicago’s top prosecutor asked cops to turn over their investigation to the FBI.

Tina Tchen, who worked as former first lady Michelle Obama’s chief of staff and is the co-founder of the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, contacted State’s Attorney Kim Foxx by text on Feb. 1 and said Smollett’s family had “concerns” about the investigation.

At the time, Smollett was still considered by police to be the victim of a hate crime.

“Spoke to the Superintendent Johnson,” Foxx emailed Tchen on Feb. 1, referring to Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. “I convinced him to reach out to FBI to ask that they take over the investigation.”

Foxx also reached out to one of Smollett’s relatives, whose name was redacted in the copies of the communication released by her office.

“Spoke to the superintendent earlier, he made the ask,” Foxx wrote. “Trying to figure out logistics. I’ll keep you posted.”

The relative responded, “Omg this would be a huge victory.”

“I make no guarantees, but I’m trying,” Foxx wrote back.

Foxx ultimately recused herself from the investigation before the narrative flipped and police said they believe Smollett was behind the alleged attack himself.

A call to the FBI seeking comment by Fox News was not immediately returned.

This is some cazzate.

A mob of protestors showed up to an Italian courthouse this week after two men were cleared of rape charges because the alleged victim was apparently deemed not attractive enough to rape. Yes, seriously.

The two men had originally been convicted of raping a then-22-year-old woman of Peruvian origin in 2015 by a court of first instance in 2016. But a year later, the accused rapists were acquitted by a group of all-female judges who felt the woman’s story was not credible enough because she looked “too masculine” to be raped.

Related: Jussie Smollett Pleads Not Guilty To Lying To Police

The case was brought back to light this week after Italy’s highest court of appeal ordered the lower court’s ruling to be scrapped and the case retired.

In response, almost 200 people gathered in the town of Ancona to protest the decision:

Chinzia Molinaro, the woman’s lawyer, told The Guardian:

“It’s shameful, but to get almost 200 people at the protest was a miracle for Italy. Fortunately, it shows that sensitivity towards such topics is becoming stronger.”

The judges’ arguments were reportedly based on a picture of the woman as well as the two men’s claims that they were not attracted to her. Apparently proving his point, one of the defendants even allegedly had the woman’s name in his phone under “Viking.”

The woman’s lawyer said she was disgusted by the court’s decision, which is why she referred it to the Supreme Court of Cassation. She explained to the outlet:

“It was disgusting to read; the judges expressed various reasons for deciding to acquit them, but one was because the [defendants] said they didn’t even like her because she was ugly. They also wrote that a photograph [of the woman] reflected this.”

According to Molinaro, the alleged victim, who eventually left Ancona and moved back to Peru due to how badly she was ostracized for reporting the men, claimed her drink was spiked with drugs during a group outing at a bar after an evening class. She noted that doctors believed her injuries were “consistent with rape” and found a high level of benzodiazepines — which is said to be a popular “date-rape drug” — in her blood.

We’re all for innocent until proven guilty, but overturning a conviction based on the alleged victim’s attractiveness is just absurd.

It’s official: Jussie Smollett says he’s not guilty.



According to Deadline, on Thursday, the 36-year-old Empire actor pled not guilty to all 16 disorderly conduct counts via his attorney, Tina Glandian.

After an Illinois grand jury indicted Smollett on the 16 felony counts, some experts believed he would enter a plea deal to entirely avoid any possibility of prison. However, it looks like the actor isn’t copping any pleas after all. He is currently out on $100,000 bail.

Trial Judge Steven Watkins conducted Thursday’s arraignment, also bestowing an expanded allowance to Smollett’s travel restrictions. The actor will now be permitted to travel to Los Angeles and New York City to consult with his legal team.

This plea hearing is Smollett’s second time in court this week, after having made an unexpected appearance during a procedural hearing on March 12, where defense lawyer Mark Geragos filled out paperwork to represent the actor. Geragos did not appear in court on Thursday.

If you can believe it, it’s only been about a month and a half since Smollett first claimed he was the victim of a homophobic and racist attack in Chicago. Of course, by now, it actually feels like years have passed since then.

Wearing a navy suit and dress coat, Smollett, 36, appeared serious and quiet standing next to his attorneys as Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to his case.

“Yes, sir,” Smollett said in a soft voice as the judge instructed him that he would next return to court on April 12. Some of his relatives sat in the court’s overflow gallery near a handful of fans, some wearing “Empire” shirts.

In an indictment returned by a grand jury last Thursday, Smollett, who is black, openly gay and plays a gay musician on Fox’s hip-hop drama, was charged with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett and his lawyers declined to comment as they left the courthouse.

Smollett was previously charged last month with felony disorderly conduct for making a false report after he told police he was attacked in January by masked supporters of President Donald Trump who beat him, slung a noose round his neck and poured a liquid chemical on him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Detectives investigated the incident as a hate crime but local news outlets cited police sources saying it was believed to be a hoax.

Fox cut Smollett’s character in “Empire” after he was arrested.

According to prosecutors, Smollett wrote a $3,500 check to two brothers and gave them $100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps used in the supposed Jan. 29 attack.

Police said Smollett hoped the incident would advance his career and secure him a higher salary.

Police initially arrested the brothers on Feb. 13, after they were recognized from surveillance footage from near the scene of the alleged attack. One had appeared with Smollett on “Empire,” police and their lawyer said. Prosecutors said one had supplied Smollett with “designer drugs” in the past.

The brothers confessed to the plot, police said. They became cooperating witnesses and were released without charges.

After the alleged attack, Smollett received support on social media, including from celebrities and Democratic presidential candidates. Others were skeptical of the incident, which Smollett said occurred at around 2 a.m. on a city street during one of the coldest weeks in recent history.

Outside the courthouse on Thursday, about a dozen supporters gathered with signs, chanting that his prosecution was unjust.

In a “Good Morning America” interview last month, Smollett said he was angry some people questioned his story and suggested racial bias may be behind the disbelief.

Judge Watkins approved a request from Smollett’s lawyers that the actor be allowed to travel freely to New York and California to consult with his bicoastal legal teams.",2019-03-14 21:46:36+00:00,'Empire' actor Smollett pleads not guilty to lying about Chicago attack,"['Kimberly Bellware', 'Min Read']","['incident', 'chicago', 'smolletts', 'watkins', 'supporters', 'brothers', 'lying', 'actor', 'smollett', 'pleads', 'attack', 'empire', 'court', 'guilty']",234

THE BUZZ

Story Continued Below

Just as they are nationwide, newly elected progressives are expected to transform the Chicago City and its Progressive Reform Caucus after the April 2 runoff.

Of the caucus’ current 11 members, two are retiring from the Council and three others still face challengers. Depending on how many progressives land in the big leather chairs of City Hall, the caucus could be larger than ever.

“You’re going to see a new Progressive Caucus with an agenda that goes beyond the day-to-day issues of a traditional alderman,” says Hanah Jubeh, a political consultant who’s advised numerous aldermen over the years. Expect debates about big-picture issues that affect the entire city—not just individual wards.

That means more attention to big issues like homelessness, TIF reform and police accountability, says Ald. Ricardo “Rick” Munoz, a founding member of the Council’s Progressive Caucus who is retiring as alderman.

But newer Council members will also have to accept there are “bread and butter” issues that can’t be ignored—no matter how progressive you are, Munoz told POLITICO. “It’s about services—taking care of tree-trimming, potholes and garbage cans.”

Newly electeds are likely to lean left of current progressives on the Council, prompting some to wonder whether that will cause friction between established and upstart progressives. Not likely, according to Ald. Scott Waguespack, who heads the Progressive Caucus. (Consider Nancy Pelosi’s lessons for managing freshmen here .)

There’s also a question about who gets to join the caucus. “It’s easier when you have votes you can look back at,” Waguespack told POLITICO. “Now we’ll look at how they make commitments to certain progressive ideas and how sternly they’re committed to them.”

Two likely new members are Daniel LaSpata (1st) and Maria Hadden (49th), who won their races outright in Round 1 of the election. Other progressives in runoffs: William Calloway (5th), Jeanette Taylor (20), Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th), Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33), Robert Murphy (39), Matt Martin (47) and Andre Vasquez (40th). (See Tribune’s list of runoffs here .)

Hadden says she wants help move forward work that the caucus has already started—including TIF reform and strengthening the Welcoming City ordinance. She also expects new members to take up the cause of reform on ethics issues.

Yes, there could be “conflicts,” Hadden told POLITICO. “But if we stick to the issues that are important to the voters who elected us, we’ll all move in the same direction.”

CAMPAIGN MODE

— Final tallies. With all mail-in ballots for the Feb. 26 election counted, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners has released the final tallies for the mayoral election. Chicagoans will vote in 15 aldermanic runoffs next month. That’s three less than four years ago, but more than any other Chicago municipal election in nearly a quarter of a century, reports Sun-Times’ Tina Sfondeles. Story here

— Ald. Patrick O’Connor is on the attack to hold on to his 40th ward aldermanic seat. And he’s using the words of his opponent, Andre Vasquez, an AT&T statewide area manager who previously was a hip-hop artist. O’Connor’s campaign has created TheTruthAboutAndre.com , which showcases lyrics from Vasquez’s music. The site includes a parental advisory about “explicit content.” O’Connor’s team calls it “bigoted and derogatory comments about women, trans and gay people.” In a recent interview with the Reader, Vasquez acknowledged “the problematic” part of hip-hop music. “It's plagued by toxic masculinity, misogyny, homophobia— and if you're a battle rapper, that's your world.” He’s been out of it for eight years.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. Jussie Smollett arraigned in Chicago court Smollett arraigned in Chicago court

(CNN) - Actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty in court Thursday to accusations that he staged a hate crime and filed a false police report.

The ""Empire"" actor, 36, was arraigned before Judge Steven Gregory Watkins, and his attorney entered the formal not guilty plea on his behalf. Watkins agreed to allow Smollett to travel to California and New York to meet with his lawyers and set his next hearing for April 17.

Gloria Schmidt, the attorney for the brothers allegedly involved in the incident, was also seated in the courtroom.

Smollett also was in court Tuesday for a hearing to determine whether a judge should allow cameras in court. His legal team said it welcomed cameras due to what it described as ""misinformation"" leaked to the media since Smollett reported being attacked in January.

""There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that has been presented as fact and evidence against Mr. Smollett, which is demonstrably false,"" said Tina Glandian, the attorney for the actor:

""We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is actually going to be the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett. And we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out.""

Smollett has been indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct by a Cook County grand jury.

Mark Geragos, one of Smollett's attorneys and a CNN legal analyst, said the actor maintains his innocence and called the indictment ""prosecutorial overkill.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines,"" Geragos said.

Smollett reported to police in January that he had been attacked in Chicago in an incident that ended with a noose around his neck. Police initially investigated the case as a possible hate crime.

The counts in the indictment obtained by CNN say Smollett gave statements to a Chicago police officer after the incident and to a detective. Details in some of those statements were different, the indictment says.

The indictment says Smollett told police he was attacked around 2 a.m. by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs.

After police detained two brothers who were ""persons of interest"" in the case in mid-February, police sources revealed that authorities suspected Smollett knew the men and allegedly had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. The men were released without being charged.

Smollett has denied any involvement in orchestrating an attack.

He was charged in February with felony disorderly conduct. The judge granted a $100,000 bail, and Smollett paid a $10,000 bond. He was ordered to give up his passport and will remain under supervision until his case is adjudicated.

(CNN) - Actor Jussie Smollett pleaded not guilty in court Thursday to accusations that he staged a hate crime and filed a false police report.

The ""Empire"" actor, 36, was arraigned before Judge Steven Gregory Watkins, and his attorney entered the formal not guilty plea on his behalf. Watkins agreed to allow Smollett to travel to California and New York to meet with his lawyers and set his next hearing for April 17.

Gloria Schmidt, the attorney for the brothers allegedly involved in the incident, was also seated in the courtroom.

Smollett also was in court Tuesday for a hearing to determine whether a judge should allow cameras in court. His legal team said it welcomed cameras due to what it described as ""misinformation"" leaked to the media since Smollett reported being attacked in January.

""There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that has been presented as fact and evidence against Mr. Smollett, which is demonstrably false,"" said Tina Glandian, the attorney for the actor:

""We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is actually going to be the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett. And we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out.""

Smollett has been indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct by a Cook County grand jury.

Mark Geragos, one of Smollett's attorneys and a CNN legal analyst, said the actor maintains his innocence and called the indictment ""prosecutorial overkill.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines,"" Geragos said.

Smollett reported to police in January that he had been attacked in Chicago in an incident that ended with a noose around his neck. Police initially investigated the case as a possible hate crime.

The counts in the indictment obtained by CNN say Smollett gave statements to a Chicago police officer after the incident and to a detective. Details in some of those statements were different, the indictment says.

The indictment says Smollett told police he was attacked around 2 a.m. by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs.

After police detained two brothers who were ""persons of interest"" in the case in mid-February, police sources revealed that authorities suspected Smollett knew the men and allegedly had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. The men were released without being charged.

Smollett has denied any involvement in orchestrating an attack.

He was charged in February with felony disorderly conduct. The judge granted a $100,000 bail, and Smollett paid a $10,000 bond. He was ordered to give up his passport and will remain under supervision until his case is adjudicated.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.

The 36-year-old actor’s lawyer, Tina Glandian, entered the plea Thursday on Smollett’s behalf after Judge Steven Watkins was assigned to oversee the case, including the trial. The next court date was scheduled for April 17.

Smollett is charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

The actor appeared in court earlier this week when prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed to allow cameras during Thursday's hearing.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.
