Over the past few weeks, we have seen several physical assaults against people wearing MAGA hats. Late last month, an 81-year-old New Jersey man was attacked after being confronted because he was wearing the red cap. In Massachusetts, a woman assaulted a patron in a Mexican restaurant because she was offended by his MAGA hat. She is now facing deportation. Lastly, A man was arrested in Kentucky after pulling a gun on a man who was sporting the supposedly offensive headgear.

Needless to say, these news stories have aroused no small level of outrage on the right, who can clearly see that they are being targeted for their political beliefs. Many in the realm of Twitter blue checkmarks have referred to these incidents as hate crimes. As egregious as these displays are, they do not constitute hate crimes, and it is counterproductive to refer to them as such.

Over the past few weeks, several prominent conservatives have spoken out against the assaults on Trump supporters wearing MAGA hats. On the heels of the media-manufactured Covington kids deception and the Jussie Smollett hoax, Americans are understandably sensitive when it comes to the red headwear.

Here are some of the tweets posted by conservatives on the matter:

Let’s be clear: physically assaulting someone because you don’t like their political beliefs is an abhorrent crime that should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. The right to free speech is one of the most crucial values upon which America was built. Those who would use violence to silence people with whom they disagree are not just wrong, they are unAmerican.

But conservatives should not fall into the trap of labeling these atrocities as hate crimes. Firstly, these incidents do not fit the established definition, which indicates that a hate crime has been committed when one “willfully causes bodily injury to any person or, through the use of fire, a firearm, a dangerous weapon, or an explosive or incendiary device, attempts to cause bodily injury to any person, because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of any person.”

Those who assault Trump supporters wearing MAGA hats are not motivated by a hatred of one’s immutable or religious characteristics; they are driven by their animus towards a political ideology that conflicts with their own. Political preference is not one of the factors determining what constitutes a hate crime.

The other reason is why we should not be so quick to pull out the hate crime card is because there is no such thing as a hate crime. Murder is murder. Assault is assault. The thoughts one holds in their minds does not have any bearing on the severity of the crime they are committing. A victim who is hospitalized during a bar fight is not somehow less injured than he would be if the person who struck him hated the victim because of his skin color.

So where did I get this radical idea? From conservatives! Right-leaning Americans have always argued that the notion of hate crimes is invalid. Indeed, it appears to have become nothing more than a political weapon that folks on the left can use when they feel like engaging in some good ol’ fashioned race baiting.

Instead of using the term “hate crime” as a hyperbolic way to describe the attacks on Trump supporters, we should call it what it is. In fact, these actions fit the definition of a term with which we are all familiar: Terrorism. Federal law states that acts of terrorism:

“Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal la rs into espousing the same views.ws of the United States or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any state.”

One of the elements that must be present for an act to fit the definition of terrorism is that the act must have been intended “to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.” Sounds about right, doesn’t it? If a person punches another because they are expressing certain political views, then they are attempting to stop them from voicing their opinions by using violence.

For the record, I am not comparing people who attack Trump supporters to terrorists like ISIS or Al-Qaeda, nor am I placing their behavior on the same level as radical extremists who commit murderous acts. These are two different types of terrorism, but they are both dangerous. In many cases, the progressive left has had a measure of success. Many Trump supporters are afraid to even hint at the idea that they might be a conservative when they interact with people at work, church, and on social media.

The only way to prevent even lower-scale acts of terrorism is to stand up to it. When far-left groups like Antifa show up at conservative rallies to assault the participants, they are hoping that their antics will cow their victims into backing down. But these individuals are nothing more than bullies — and you know how to stop a bully. Conservatives can’t afford to be intimidated into silence. The more we speak out, the less effective these incidents will become."

It has long been a basic rule of political public relations that you ignore conspiracies, misinformation or base insinuations because acknowledging them gives them life.

But the new normal of American politics, when even the president of the United States will traffic in baseless claims and wild rumors, requires political operatives to reacquaint themselves with an old mantra: Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

The communications team for Sen. Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has taken that approach, moving aggressively to call out material that is baseless. The campaign is early, but they have already had to deal with misinformation that ranges from the silly to seedy.

One of the first lies came from well known internet troll Jacob Wohl, who tweeted Harris was ineligible to become president because her immigrant parents weren’t in the country five years before she was born. The campaign retweeted in five minutes that the claim was “garbage” — there is no such residential requirement.

“I don’t think there’s any option to ignore anything anymore,” said Brian Fallon, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign press secretary. “Any 2020 campaign’s press operation is wise to be constantly monitoring what gets picked up on Twitter, essentially, and to immediately speak to debunk and contain rather than wish it would go away.”

Clinton’s campaign was constantly plagued by rumors of bad health, which her campaign ignored, and Barack Obama ignored birther rumors for years before finally giving in and producing the long form of his birth certificate. There are still people in this country who don’t believe him.

Ben LaBolt, Obama’s former campaign press secretary, said you can’t ignore conspiracy theories in the era of the internet and social media where bogus claims can rapidly grow and fester.

“We live in a world where you can’t even necessarily trust what’s coming out of the president of the United States’ mouth, and he’s not going to check his sources before he tweets something out,” LaBolt said. “Once things are in the ecosystem, they’re in an environment with no editors, and it’s the campaign’s responsibility to serve as those editors.”

Even people not running for president, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, see the utility in quickly shooting down lies. She has replaced Clinton as the favorite punching bag of conservatives, but she’s not going to take it lying down.

“I grew up seeing these false attacks on Nancy Pelosi,” she said recently. “I grew up with these attacks on Barack Obama. I grew up with these bad-faith attacks, even on Hillary Clinton.

“It feels like an extra job (responding to false claims),” she said. “I’ve got a full-time job in Congress and then I moonlight as America’s greatest villain, or as the new hope. And it’s pretty tiring.”

Facebook and other social media companies became conduits in the 2016 presidential campaign for these falsehoods, helping to spread fake news, allowing the creation of fake groups, and running misleading advertisements to try to sway voters. Nobody knows how much impact these efforts had on the election, but they can’t be dismissed in an election where less than 100,000 votes in three states decided the outcome in the Electoral College.

A new study suggests that a small segment of the population — about one in 12 — were eager to share false information during the 2016 campaign. Research published in the journal Science Advances found that people over 65 who call themselves ultra-conservatives share about seven times more fake information masquerading as news on social media than other Americans.

“For something to be viral you’ve got to know who shares it,” said study co-author Jonathan Nagler, a politics professor at New York University. “Wow, old people are much more likely than younger people to do this.”

Researchers from NYU and Princeton interviewed 2,711 people who used Facebook in 2016. Nearly half agreed to share all of their postings with the professors, who used three different lists of false information sites and counted how often they shared from those sites. To double check, they looked at 897 specific articles that have been found false by fact checkers and tracked how often they were spread.

Researchers believe a lack of “digital literacy” may help explain the research results. Senior citizens may not tell truth from lies on social media as easily as others, researchers said. Whatever the reason, this trend has been noticed by political operatives from both parties.

“Mostly 60 plus who when they read on Real/Eagle/Patriot/News/Buzzfeed/3000.ru and they see a story about Hillary being a robot lesbian they go wow,” said Rick Wilson, a veteran GOP campaign strategist. “They love this stuff and they become addicted to it.” Seniors also vote in large numbers.

Facebook has become every critic’s favorite bad boy for the dissemination of lies and misleading information, but it is hardly the only outlet that is spreading this stuff. And conservatives aren’t the only people who want to believe nonsense.

I experienced firsthand during the 2016 campaign how eagerly people latch onto this stuff. When Clinton fainted at a 9/11 memorial ceremony, armchair physicians without access to her medical records and laymen pontificated on her health. Trump released sketchy physical exam results about that time, so I decided to turn the tables and write an article for my blog headlined, “Does Trump have syphilis? That would explain a lot.”

The article questioned his physical exam, noted his Playboy lifestyle and philandering ways, and suggested his behavior on the campaign trail could be indicative of somebody with venereal disease. I concluded that I would remain skeptical of his mental health until he underwent a rigorous neurological exam and produced evidence he is free of venereal disease.

Everything in the article was factual, but I never claimed he had VD. The article received more hits than anything else I’ve written on my blog, and is still getting hits today. Those people, probably liberals, wanted to believe what I wrote.

So expect a continuous stream of denials of “facts” that will be circulating on the internet between now and November 2020. If there’s one thing we’ve learned in our sharply divided country, it is that people will embrace almost anything that validates what they believe.

The Empire actor, who is biracial and an avowed homosexual, had claimed that two Trump supporters attacked him on a Chicago street in January. But his account, which did not appear accurate from the get-go, soon fell apart.

The grand jury’s indictment of Smollet on more than a dozen felonies comes almost a month after he told police two racist whites beat him, called him names and put a noose around his neck.

But police quickly concluded Smollett’s claims about the attack on January 29 in downtown Chicago were another hate hoax, this one, they charged, by a highly-paid actor, a star on Fox’s Empire, who wasn’t satisfied with his salary.

Tall Tale

Smollett’s troubles began when he decided that between $65,000 and $100,000 per episode of Empire wasn’t enough pay, police found. But Smollett got a bright idea after the program’s director, Lee Daniels, TMZ reported, posted a story on Instagram about a cousin who suffered a attack by “homophobes.”

Wrote Daniels, “This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories. It’s the beginning of a new year and we need to do better. We need to continue to remember to love and to turn against the hate that we’re seeing out there.”

Reported TMZ, “Some cast members think Jussie’s gears started grinding in his head days after Lee posted a video on Instagram on January 10 calling out homophobia.”

That much might be speculation, but the rest of the story isn’t. On January 22, Smollett alleged, he received a hate letter from supporters of President Trump. Bearing the ominous return address “MAGA” — Make America Great Again — the envelope contained white powder that turned out to be acetaminophen, an over-the-counter pain reliever, and a threatening message fashioned like a ransom note in cut-out letters: “You will die black f*g.”

On January 29, returning from the Subway after a 2 a.m. munchies run, Smollett alleged, two whites attacked him. Smollett claims he never said the men wore MAGA hats, as was initially reported. But they were most certainly MAGA men.

“This is MAGA country,” the two shouted, according to Smollett. They also called him a “n****r.” Then they beat him up, doused him with bleach, and and put a noose around his neck. Chicago police couldn’t find surveillance video that depicted the attack. But they did uncover video with two shadowy figures.

The story quickly went viral, with no one asking why two white guys were running thither and yon in Chicago at 2 a.m., in sub-zero temperatures, looking for a random black man to attack. City detectives quickly learned otherwise. Smollett paid two black Nigerian brothers to stage the attack. The evidence? Text messages, video that showed the brothers’ purchase of supplies, and the $3,500 check with which Smollett paid them.

Chicago cops were understandably furious. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett dragged “Chicago’s reputation through the mud” and lambasted the actor because he “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

“It’s shameful,” he said. “It’s just despicable.”

The Indictment

On February 21, cops arrested Smollett and charged him with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false report. He pleaded not guilty and was released on $100,000 bail.

The 16-count indictment, filed on March 7 in Cook County Circuit Court, is “two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told,” ABC 7 in Chicago reported:

The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.

The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.

Smollett, who was convicted of lying to police in 2007, will likely plead guilty. But regardless of how he pleads, this case may not be his only legal trouble.

The feds are investigating a “racist” letter he apparently sent to himself. Mail fraud carries a five- to 10-year prison sentence.

In February, Jones spoke out about persistent instances of inequities across the state during a speech in the House, according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Several other state politicians weighed in, including Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, Rep. Donald McEachin, D-4th and Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico.

“Proud of you Lamont. Enough chit chat. Long past time for action!” tweeted Rep. Donald McEachin, D-4th.

According to these frustrated state leaders, not enough has been done since a photo of Northam was released from his 1984 medical school yearbook, appearing to show the governor in blackface. However, Northam said it wasn’t him but admitted to other racist actions in his past. He has refused to resign, despite many calls urging him to."

CNN describes the prison sentence as “light” in “Manafort’s light sentence shines a light on US prison inequality”.

Certainly I would expect this kind of zeal for long prison terms from executives in the American prison industry, but none of these folks owe their paychecks to the incarceration mill.

How does Manafort’s first sentence (he’s still being chased by some other prosecutors for some other crimes) compare to sentences considered fair a few decades ago?

The Growth of Incarceration in the United States says that circa 1980, the average time served in prison for an American convicted of murder was 5 years.

Japanese war criminals responsible for killing thousands rather than millions of innocent people were released after about four years (nytimes, 1949; see also the Wikipedia page on Japanese war criminals (none served more than 13 years)). The typical convicted Nazi war criminal was released after a few years (Wikipedia list of the highest-profile ones). Some of the higher level ones were imprisoned until the mid-1950s (example: Otto Hofmann, one of the architects of the death camp system at the Wannsee Conference).

Damir Dosen was “indicted for persecutions, inhumane treatment and torture as crimes against humanity and for outrages upon personal dignity, torture and cruel treatment as violations of the laws or customs of war”, pleaded guilty, and was found “responsible for crimes against humanity”. The Bosnian Serb was sentenced to 5 years and served 3.5 (released in 2003).

How about Jussie Smollett? He has now been indicted for 16 felonies as a consequence of trying to expose Trump supporters for who they really are (unfortunately he didn’t know where to find any actual Trump supporters). He could be imprisoned for up to 64 years (Vox).

Police said Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

After an investigation, Chicago police said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show.

Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

The punch I took on campus was not an isolated incident. Leftists are targeting conservative students across the country for their political beliefs.

A man promoting conservative views was punched on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, in February 2019. Screenshot from YouTube. (Photo: YouTube)

The past two weeks have been surreal. On Feb. 19, while recruiting conservative students on campus at the University of California-Berkeley, I was assaulted by a violent leftist. A little more than a week later, I got to shake hands with the president of the United States and address an audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference about why it's more important than ever to protect free speech on our college campuses.

As a field representative for the Leadership Institute, I travel to campuses throughout California helping conservative clubs recruit and train new members. I've seen the intolerance and hate toward conservatives on our campuses with my own eyes, and the only difference between what happened to me on Feb. 19 and every other day is that the event was caught on video.

Conservative students across the country have suffered verbal and physical assault, social ostracism and even academic persecution for voicing their opinions on political topics. This is because young liberals believe that they are on the morally righteous side in a culture war and, in order to win, they must silence any form of dissent. Leftists and the progressives aspire to nothing less than to make it de facto impossible to be conservative in public.

The United States is well on its way to achieving this goal, based on the Covington Catholic High School incident. Wearing a red hat near the Lincoln Memorial was apparently enough for the news and social media personalities to label the act provocation, and commentators worked aggressively to ""dox"" the students. In their frenzy, students were even misidentified, and at least one boy and his family were allegedly harassed. By contrast, there was not a similar rush to expose the identity of the man who was caught on video assaulting me.

Differing political ideas treated as violent

Increasingly, leftists believe they are justified to respond to ideas disagreeable to them with open hostility and even force. Students are commonly told now that words are literally violent and can be responded to with physical force. I don't mean verbal threats of violence or efforts to intimidate, I mean words that express ideas that the listener finds offensive or disagrees with.

The message that provoked my attacker was our sign that read ""Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,"" a reference to the recent case of Jussie Smollett, who was charged by Chicago police with filing a false police report about an apparently fictitious attack. My attacker said we were promoting violence, which, in his view, gives him permission to use any means necessary to shut us down. The irony is that the sign was intended to warn of the danger of disregarding facts and jumping to judgment in an effort to confirm a narrative our feelings tell us is true.

The message applies to more than the Smollett story, and the search for truth is certainly relevant on campuses of higher education, where students are supposed to grow personally and intellectually — not only through textbook and classroom learning but also by exchanging ideas, debating tough topics, and being challenged to defend their views. This growth cannot happen when speech is restricted — that's not only a disservice to students but a threat to our republic as well.

Berkeley's anti-conservative record

The Berkeley administration in particular has allowed a culture of intolerance and violence toward conservatives to grow. The College Republicans club has had its property vandalized, and critics have called for the members to be lynched. When there was a pro-Trump rally in April 2017, a former community college professor was arrested for allegedly assaulting multiple supporters with a bike lock. He later accepted a plea deal.

When Milo Yiannopoulos visited in February 2017, the campus became the site of violent riots. Some people even threw Molotov cocktails and fireworks, injuring students and causing $100,000 worth of damage to the school. Berkeley police canceled the speech after ""an apparently organized violent attack and destruction of property"" forced them to evacuate Yiannopoulos for his own protection.

After I was assaulted, a university employee tweeted (now deleted), ""The MAGA people on UC Berkeley campus yesterday got punched in the face by someone this makes me feel emotionally so much better.""

Since the arrest last week of the person who assaulted me, we have learned that he was once a student and employee of UC Berkeley.

Progress depends on the freedom of the human person to develop ideas and voice them. And we’re all better when this intellectual growth happens. The battle to protect free speech is one of the most important culture battles facing our nation today.

There are so many students across the country fighting for their right to free speech. They don’t do it for recognition; they do it because they understand how imperative this human right is and are willing to defend it.

President Donald Trump's forthcoming executive order requiring colleges and universities to protect free speech in order to receive federal funds shows that he agrees. I'm proud of our president and, as I get ready to head back out in the field, I draw strength in knowing that we have his support and the support of conservative students who continue to stand up for their political beliefs."

Then again, when you consider it involves Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s little that should surprise us — including the fact that said graffito may not have even existed and could have been a figment of an MSNBC analyst’s claims.

So, the saga of the alleged hateful scrawl in the bathroom of an airport begins on Tuesday morning when David Corn — D.C. bureau chief for liberal rag Mother Jones and MSNBC contributor — tweeted about the anti-Ocasio-Cortez vandalism.

“I just spotted obscene anti-@AOC graffiti in a bathroom stall in the Phoenix airport,” he tweeted. “Yes, really. (Not going to post a photo of it.)”

Looking at the tweet in isolation, I didn’t think I would need to see a photo of the “obscene anti-@AOC graffiti” Corn was talking about. In fact, the only part of this tweet that interested me is the fact that Corn engaged in one of my random pet peeves: using “graffiti” to refer to a single instance of vandalism as opposed to the correct singular form of the noun, “graffito.”

The kind of person who would scrawl something on a bathroom stall with a marker is also the kind of person who would use said marker for purposes of intoxication; I’m not terribly concerned with their political opinions and I’m surprised Corn would be, though his opinions on Ocasio-Cortez are probably diametrically opposed to mine. There wasn’t anything remotely interesting about this tweet — that is, until the airport responded to him.

OK, so that’s slightly curious. The Daily Wire’s Amanda Prestigiacomo asked further questions regarding the graffito. (Which she called graffiti as well, proof that there are some things both the left and the right get wrong.)

Hi Amanda, we did have our custodians check the restrooms in Terminal 2 and they let us know that they did not find anything. That doesn’t mean something wasn’t cleaned up earlier in the day. Thanks, — PHX Sky Harbor (@PHXSkyHarbor) March 6, 2019

Amber Athey of The Daily Caller decided to dig a bit deeper. (Although not deeply enough to consult a dictionary regarding the proper use of that g-word — for the love of Pete, people.) Smelling a minor-league Jussie Smollett incident, she messaged the MSNBC contributor and asked him if she could see the picture of the infamous graffito.

“Corn replied that he did not trust me enough to share the photo with me online, an admission I found somewhat ironic considering a whole lot of people didn’t trust Corn enough to think the graffiti was real,” she wrote in a Friday article. “Nonetheless, Corn offered to show me the photo in person if I dropped by his office the next day.

“We ended up meeting at a coffee shop between our two offices on Thursday morning, and Corn requested I record our conversation, which I was happy to do. As a condition of seeing the photograph of the anti-AOC graffiti, I had to agree not to quote what the graffiti actually said.

“Given the relative lengths I had to go to just to catch a glimpse of this photo, I was preparing myself for something pretty wild.

“The graffiti consisted of three words and compared Ocasio-Cortez to poop.”

You can probably take a decent guess as to what it said. Corn, however, was a bit more concerned about the timestamp on the photograph to prove he wasn’t engaging in a low-stakes Morton Downey Jr. airport stunt.

“You can see the time it was taken. Tuesday, 1 o’clock p.m.,” Corn told Athey. “Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. And if that doesn’t trust you, you can do the information, and it says ‘places: Sky Harbor Blvd., Phoenix, Sky Harbor Airport,’ with a little photo in the middle of the map.”

Athey then asked whether or not he sent the picture to authorities at Sky Harbor International Airport. “I didn’t DM them, because I said follow me and I will DM you the picture, and they never followed me,” he said.

“And they didn’t DM you?” she responded.

“No, there are no DMs. They said they sent someone to look, and they didn’t find it,” he replied. “I think they probably had more important things to worry about at the airport.”

“At least I hope so,” he added. “And I was able to, you know, I was curious how indelible it might be. So I took a piece of toilet paper and rubbed one of the letters, and with a lot of elbow grease it came off, and then I just kind of stopped.”

The rest of the interview was a melange of strangeness. Corn says he thought the Ocasio-Cortez-related graffito was worth being mentioned because it was so far from her home district. (The idea that maybe it was one of her constituents passing through Phoenix was never explored, though it seems unlikely.)

There was also a discussion regarding whether liberals would have attacked a Daily Caller writer who tweeted about vandalism regarding a conservative the same way conservatives attacked him on Twitter. (Somewhat unsurprisingly, Corn doesn’t think they would while Athey wasn’t so sure.)

And then there was talk over the nature of the responses he received.

“The attacks ranged from questioning my sanity to questioning my masculinity,” Corn said. “People say I’m only doing this because I want to date her. I mean, why are so many of the criticisms about her sexualized? That’s a pretty interesting question. And then also people saying I should kill myself … I mean that’s a pretty over-the-top question.”

Again, peoples’ responses on Twitter are roughly as telling regarding the political climate of the country as graffito-writing marker fiends at Sky Harbor International Airport are. That doesn’t mean there weren’t valid reasons to question this foul-sounding story.

The fact that there’s a subset of Twitterers who aren’t playing with a full deck doesn’t make “over-the-top” insults such as Corn is talking about right, but it puts them in context. They’re not coming from bureau chiefs for Mother Jones or analysts for MSNBC.

Corn is both of those things, and while Athey seems to have proved (to herself, at least) the scrawl existed and that someone thinks Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is comparable to poop, it’s still a truly bizarre story that people were right to question. Why was this worth tweeting about in the first place? Why didn’t the airport find evidence of the vandalism? Why the strange John le Carré-worthy meeting at a coffee shop to show a Daily Caller reporter the photo? Why not send the picture to anyone — in particular, someone at Sky Harbor Airport?

“Long story short, I can confirm that the anti-AOC graffiti exists,” Athey said at the conclusion of her story. “I’m not sure it was worth a 15-minute walk in below-freezing weather, but it is, in fact, real.”

Yes, but we still don’t know why there was so much secrecy or why we can’t examine the evidence. And I still don’t know why people think “graffiti” is now acceptable in both the plural and the singular. Inquiring minds want to know.

For the uninitiated, Goop is Paltrow's wellness brand, which has produced such controversial products as coffee enemas and jade eggs meant to be inserted into the vagina. The company has routinely been criticized for embracing pseudoscience to sell its products. It has been sued for making unfounded health claims, which the company settled for $145,000.

When recently confronted by BBC News about the claims that her company sells products based on pseudoscience, Paltrow replied, ""We disagree with that wholeheartedly. We really believe that there are healing modalities that have existed for thousands of years, and they challenge maybe a very conventional Western doctor that might not believe necessarily in the healing powers of essential oils or any variety of acupuncture - things that have been tried and tested for hundreds of years.""

But Paltrow showed a good sense of humor about her own company Saturday night.

The bit began with Heidi Gardner reprising her role as Goop employee Baskin Johns, who appears on the segment to tout the company's products despite knowing nothing about them. In the end, she always ends up making outlandish claims about the products.

Johns finds herself in the same boat this go-round, panicking as she described the ingredients in the Goop body wash, which includes ginger and ashwagandha, an herb. But when co-host Michael Che asks what the latter ingredient is, Johns makes up a story about Paltrow visiting Wakanda, the fictional country from Marvel's ""Black Panther,"" and finding the herb there.

She grows increasingly flustered, telling Che that if she messes up this interview then she'd have to ""go live in Missouri for a year, work at Bath and Body Works and let my roots grow out."" So she asks if she can bring out her supervisor, Goop manager Fifer James.

Cue Paltrow, rolling up in a chair as James and acting like a carbon-copy of Johns.

""Fifer, I need your help because I'm really scared that Gwyneth's going to fire me,"" Johns says.

""No, she doesn't believe in firing, remember? It's called 'conscious unemploying,'"" Paltrow's James responds, a reference to the real-life Paltrow's divorce announcement which stated she was ""consciously uncoupling"" from her now-ex, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.

She then attempts to help Johns by selling the ""Himalayan salt scrub"" which is the ""No. 1 salt scrub, rated No. 1 in overall salt."" Like Johns she begins to panic, calling salt ""angry sugar"" and then repeating ""No. 1"" in tandem with Johns.

Finally realizing neither of them can correctly hawk their own productions, a confused Che asks what most at home were probably wondering: ""What does Goop stand for?"" To which the duo says in unison, ""Gwyneth Opens Our Paychecks.""

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Kelly Mocked at NAACP Image Awards Nominees Luncheon,['Christi Carras'],https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/rexfeatures_10146570ac.jpg,"['star', 'black', 'image', 'naacp', 'awards', 'netflix', 'luncheon', 'r', 'long', 'movies', 'mocked', 'nominees', 'major', 'nominee', 'kelly']","The NAACP does not stand with R. Kelly. At Saturday’s nominees luncheon for the 50th NAACP Image Awards, the organization’s president and CEO Derrick Johnson slammed the R&B singer, who recently made waves in a CBS interview with Gayle King. In the viral clip, Kelly yells and cries as he denies his alleged sexual abuse of multiple female victims, many of whom were minors.

“We cannot celebrate inclusion as long as we look at the foolishness on television, whether it’s R. Kelly or other unfortunate incidents,” Johnson said. “We must continue to uphold and uplift all of our creativity because it’s through our creative power that we will continue to lead the nation.”

Kelly had already been the subject of mockery earlier in the program. The CBS spot earned him another mention during opening banter between co-hosts Sheryl Lee Ralph and Major, who collected three NAACP Image nominations.

“I thought Jesus was recovering after that Gayle King interview,” Ralph quipped, prompting Major to impersonate Kelly’s widely-circulated statement on his alleged crimes: “‘I didn’t do it!’ Major shouted. “While the cameras were on, ‘I didn’t do it!'”

Negativity surrounding Kelly’s case was part of a deeper discussion about the importance of positive representation for people of color to overpower such standalone behavior. The nominees were optimistic that milestones like “Black Panther” are indicative of a positive shift in how Hollywood handles minority stories.

“Black people are making noise right now,” said “This Is Us” star and NAACP Image nominee Lyric Ross. “Especially young people — they’re speaking out and telling you what you need to hear, and that’s what we need right now.”

“This year’s Oscars felt pretty cool — we had ‘Black Panther’ up there; ‘Green Book’ won,” added “Black-ish” star and NAACP Image nominee Marcus Scribner. “Black talent has been making a lot of amazing movies and television shows for a really long time, and it’s cool to see us finally getting recognized on the grand stage.”

Many also stressed the necessity of producers, working behind the scenes at companies like Netflix, who champion inclusive storytelling.

“There’s always work to do, but I definitely think that we have amazing networks like Netflix who really don’t see barriers when it comes to telling stories from different lenses,” said “Dear White People” star and NAACP Image nominee Logan Browning. “That’s why Netflix changed their logo. It does the ’N’ and then it breaks off into this multicolor thing because they just see it as everyone should be able to tell their story. It should be specific to people’s cultures and their backgrounds but also just kind of a flow where there are no lines and anyone can get into anyone else’s story.”

“Luke Cage” director and NAACP Image nominee Salli Richardson-Whitfield echoed Browning’s sentiments about the streaming service, which she praised for “grabbing a lot of the big black producers.” Despite Netflix’s recent cancellation of “Luke Cage” as part of a wider purge of its Marvel content, Richardson-Whitfield maintained her loyalty to the streamer in the Steven Spielberg-versus-Netflix debate.

“The one thing that Netflix does is give people of different ethnicities a chance to have their movies be seen, and as long as it is a movie, and it comes up to the caliber of the movies that are out, then I think that Steven’s going to have to go with the future of movies,” she said, referencing Spielberg’s public skepticism surrounding Netflix’s Oscar eligibility.

More acting and creative nominees in attendance included Adele Lim, Daisy Lightfoot, Essence Atkins, James Mathis III, Katrina M. O’Gilvie, Kay Oyegun, Laya DeLeon Hayes and Loretta Devine. The luncheon was held at the Loews Hollywood Hotel in Los Angeles, and the 50th NAACP Image Awards will take place on March 30 at the Dolby Theatre.

Members of the NAACP did not make any comments during the reception regarding its supporting actor in a drama series nomination for “Empire” star Jussie Smollett, who, on Friday, was indicted on 16 counts for an allegedly-staged hate crime earlier this year."

Ride wave

I had the most moving experience recently. My wife and I enjoyed our annual birthday/anniversary celebration on the Murder Mystery train with our friends. The train ride, entertainment, food, and drinks were up to their usual high standards.

Although, the thing that truly made a lasting impression on me was the people waving to us as we passed by. Men, women, and children were standing along the track waving. People inside their apartments, which line the track, were waving from their windows. Drivers stopped at the train crossing, as we passed, waved to us. People were waving from their yards. We’re not celebrities in a parade, although by the reception you would have thought so. Of course, we waved back.

It struck me that with the increasing popularity of incivility, anti-social media, and divisiveness in our country total strangers could get back to basics and display a simple act of kindness – waving. I don’t quite understand how this simple act could effect me so deeply.

Maybe .... no politics, no bullying, no class warfare, no immigration issues, no inappropriate behavior, no sexual orientation, no ethnicity, no judgment – just a simple “hello” from one stranger to another. Try it, it will make you feel good.

Blatant hypocrisy

Today's ""upside-down world"" is filled with contradictions. For instance"" #MeToo"" sympathizers proclaim that women own their bodies, hence have right to abort at any time. But they aren't as tolerant with females who feed their families by engaging in the worlds oldest profession. Rather than paint toenails, many earn more in an hour than their male counterparts make in a week. Their bodies, right?

Sex customers, or ""Johns"", aren't hardened criminals. They run the gamut from judges, to field hands, to presidents. At worse, they are guilty of misdemeanors but are being snared in sting operations intended to catch child predators and traffickers. A clear contradiction in purpose.

Much of the current hubbub on this dicey subject is being stirred up by progressives masquerading as paragons of virtue. Case in point: Jussie Smollett is being portrayed as a victim instead of the perpetrator of a hoax that he is. Clearly libs see what they choose to see – the way they choose to see it. And that, my friends, is a paradox or blatant hypocrisy. Take your pick.

Fund schools

The Florida Legislative session began March 5. As supporters of neighborhood public schools, we demand that the Legislature fund our schools, fund our students, and fund our future. The educators and support personnel in Florida’s public schools are concerned about two funding issues: school safety and growing teacher shortages.

All students deserve a world-class education that starts with a safe learning environment and a certified teacher in every classroom. Florida is suffering from an alarming teacher shortage, in part, because legislators engage in “bonus pay” schemes rather than adequately fund teacher and support personnel salaries.

Even though student performance on standardized testing is among the best in the country, Florida ranks 45th in the nation for teacher salaries and 47th for support personnel salaries. Florida started this school year with over 4,000 teacher vacancies, in December less than half of the vacancies had been filled (many being filled by substitute teachers without appropriate certification).

The Florida Department of Education projects over 10,000 teacher vacancies at the start of the next school year. We need Floridians who care about their neighborhood public schools to remind their legislators to work harder to solve the widespread teacher and staff shortages facing public schools.

They had a point. Milano is neither trans, gay, disabled nor a person of color. Much like Democrat presidential candidate Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, she’s just a standard white woman, not that there’s anything remotely wrong with being one. You go, girl!

But claiming to be something you’re not? Even the loudest critics of PC culture and identity politics would argue that pretending to be someone or something you’re not is just plain wrong.

In response to the deserved criticism, the actress issued a lackluster non-apology apology.

“I’m glad this tweet invoked conversation,” she wrote. “I’m so sorry it offended some. I see you and hear you. But just a reminder, empathy is not a bad thing. Nuance is important and literal interpretation is not always intended. And I can identify with and not identify as. Both are powerful.”

She shares a lot in common with the leftist media hacks who responded to the hate crime hoax perpetrated by actor Jussie Smollett by touting how the hoax had focused the public’s attention on the alleged epidemic of hate crimes against “ordinary Black LGBTQ people” and started a conversation.

A Chicago grand jury has pounded the allegedly truth-challenged actor with an impressive 16-counts of felony indictments. The Empire television star, who authorities claim initiated false hate crimes to garner attention and potentially a fatter salary, has successfully achieved one of his ill-thought-out goals – he is a person of interest in the minds of America. Just not for the reasons he intended.

The grand jury methodically outlined two separate sets of charges; one scrutinized Smollett’s original and allegedly fraudulent testimony to police, and the other deals with subsequent claims that the supposed attackers used racial and homophobic slurs, and draped a noose around his neck.

Smollett Spin-Off

Local law enforcement believes that Smollett’s spin-off mini-series began when he sent a false hate mail letter with a white substance to himself. Apparently, the powers that be on set at Empire studios hurt Jussie’s feelings when they pooh-poohed the crudely made missive with cut out magazine letters and a cartoon hanging man of poor artistic quality.

Instead of happily cashing his hefty $65,000 per episode checks, Smollett appears to have thrown an epic tantrum. Doubling down on augmenting what he seems to perceive as an unfair wage, he paid two friends to fake assault him and yell “MAGA country” a couple of times in case there were witnesses. Normal-thinking people are stumped that Smollett created such a far-flung publicity stunt when asking for a raise might’ve been an easier path. But psychologists find this behavior prevalent in a charged environment – and Smollett was a President Trump hater beyond reason, blaming the man for every crisis du jour and gaining a lot of attention for his political Twitter tirades.

Dr. Eric Hickey, a forensic psychologist and dean of the California School of Forensic Studies for Alliant International University, claims “high-profile criminal cases with greater media coverage are ripe for false reports … they’re needy. It gives them a chance to be heard.”

Oh, they heard you Jussie.

Unintended Front-Page Consequences

If these alleged felonies were committed in another state – say, California – Smollett would already be out of cable news rotation and checked into celebrity rehab. But Illinois is a different animal when poorly executed hate hoaxes are concerned. The Land of Lincoln frowns severely on this kind of behavior, and making false reports to police officers is a felony within the state’s disorderly statute –punishable by up to three years in prison. The elements that make it a felony include “any kind of transmission to a peace officer reporting a crime without reasonable grounds.”

The charges falling under the disorderly statute carry a potential punitive sentence, ranging from one to three years in prison and a fine up to $25,000. Multiply by 16 counts, and it has become a real threat to Smollett’s freedom. Or he could just get probation.

But that is just the state of Illinois – the feds may want a piece of the pie if they find the actor committed mail fraud. Punishment if convicted of sending yourself intimidating hate mail ranges from fines of up to $250,000, to prison time up to 20 years.

Get Out of Jail Free

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former celeb Rosie O’Donnell have deleted their tweets of support. Other mouthy liberals are acting (better than Jussie) as if those frigid winter weeks never happened at all – feigning total ignorance of the event. And, of course, Senators Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) are feeling the sting of their ill-timed “modern day lynching” rhetoric and their decision to make Smollett the poster boy for their federal anti-lynching bill.

There is little doubt that the drive-by media, sucked into reporting fake news that fit snuggly into an anti-conservative message, will stop covering the Smollett case. He is no longer useful. The most important question that remains unanswered is whether Jussie Smollett will pay for any of his crimes.

Even with 16 felony indictments, 20th Century Fox Television has only removed Smollett from two episodes of the popular drama. Perhaps Smollett is already setting the stage for his great escape from punishment – he has started the drumbeat with police, stating on record that he had an “untreated drug problem.” Yes, wait for the young man to head to rehab – the celebrity get out of jail free card."

FILE - In this Feb. 21, 2019 file photo, ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett leaves Cook County jail following his release in Chicago. A Cook County grand jury on Friday, March 8, 2019 has indicted Smollett on 16 felony charges after authorities say he falsely told police that he was attacked by two men in Chicago. Associated Press

CHICAGO -- News that a grand jury had indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct - the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police - are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren't uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett's comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

""What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,"" said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos called the 16-count indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" But prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it's the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

""It is common practice for the Cook County state's attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,"" he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

""If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you're done,"" said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. ""This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.""

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett's account into each individual pieces and accuse him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett's contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

""The lies add up pretty fast,"" Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won't matter whether it's on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That's because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

""If you add them all up it's still only one crime,"" Erickson said. ""That's just how it is.""

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett's legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed - a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if Smollett did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

""Lying to the FBI is a crime,"" said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" Geragos, his attorney, said.

Things continue to spiral downward for Jussie Smollett.

On Friday, a grand jury indicted the Empire star on 16 felony counts claiming he falsely reported he was a victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

These new charges are in addition to the previous charge of filing a false police report for which he pled not guilty and was released on $100K bail.

While Smollett maintains he did not stage the attack, the 36-year-old was written out of two episodes of the Fox series and producers are reportedly considering re-casting the role entirely.

Although no decision has been made, here are five out gay actors (apologies to the two Nigerian brothers) who could potentially step into Smollett’s shoes and take over the part of Jamal Lyon.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Frank (@blonded) on Jun 2, 2018 at 1:52pm PDT

While we can’t vouch for his acting, the queer rapper definitely has the singing chops to fill the role of Jamal. Last year the 31-year-old was reportedly set to make his big screen debut in an indie film entitled Ships Passing in the Night, but that role has yet to materialize. Since it’s been almost three years since Ocean released his last album Blonde, jumping on the Lyon train could be just the kind of exposure to take his stardom to the next level.

The loud & proud former Love & Hip-Hop star has been very vocal believing Smollett’s alleged assault was all a hoax from the get-go. He also claims Smollett had a hand in banning him from ever appearing on Empire, so it’s not much of a stretch to think the 35-year-old would take pleasure in stealing his job and showing the world a side of himself they haven’t already seen in Paper magazine.

3. Brian Michael Smith

Empire could contribute to more trans visibility on broadcast television by casting Smith as Jamal.

Smith – who came out as a transgender man in 2017 – currently stars as a trans police officer on OWN’s Queen Sugar. Prior to that, he played cis characters on Girls and Blue Bloods.

Interestingly, while Empire doesn’t currently feature any trans stars in regular roles, its spin-off Star features transgender actress Amiyah Scott as Queen Latifah’s trans daughter.

4. Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman (@jeffreybchapman) on Jan 29, 2019 at 9:14am PST

Chapman may be the most natural replacement for Smollett simply because they’ve worked together in the past.

While fans know Chapman from Unreal, American Horror Story: Apocalypse and guest judging on RuPaul’s Drag Race, they may not be as familiar with his performance alongside Smollett in the gay romantic comedy The Skinny. In the 2012 film, the two actors played former college friends that reunite for gay pride weekend in NYC.

This prior history may work in Chapman’s favor if he were to take over the role simply because it might be the one choice Smollett has least issue with …or most!

5. Billy Porter

At 49, the Pose star may be too old to play middle son Jamal Lyon. Then again, we’d be willing to suspend disbelief (um, it is Empire after all!), because in Porter’s hands the weekly fashion battles between Jamal and Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) would be absolutely legendary, boo boo kitty!

(Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty)

Jussie Smollett’s lawyer has claimed that the Empire actor is the victim of a “media gangbang.”

The actor was indicted by a grand jury on 16 felony counts on Friday (March 8) for filing false police reports relating to a hate crime attack.

Smollett claimed in January that he was the victim of a homophobic and racist attack, but Chicago police have accused him of perpetrating the attack on himself with two associates.

Lawyer: Jussie Smollett facing ‘media gangbang’

The star maintains his innocence, however, with lawyer Mark Geragos claiming he has been the victim of a “media gangbang.”

Speaking to CNN’s Anderson Cooper following the March 8 indictment, he said: “What is happening here is, frankly, a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions.

“I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case has.

“It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty.”

Geragos attacked the decision to file a total of felony 16 counts, which could carry a lengthy prison time.

Police have ‘no evidence’ linking Smollett to crime, lawyer claims

The lawyer also referred to an ongoing probe within the Chicago Police Department over the leaking of false information relating to the case.

He added that despite police claims that the attack was faked to secure a salary increase on Empire, law enforcement officials “have not talked to one person at Fox who said he was dissatisfied with his money.”

Geragos noted that doubt has been cast over a widely-reported media claim that Smollett paid associates Abel and Ola Osundairo $3,500 to fake the attack. Records suggest that the money was in fact a personal training fee.

The lawyer said: “I don’t understand where any of this comes from. He supposedly paid for it? There’s no evidence of that.”

Geragos also questioned why no charges had been brought against the Osundairo brothers, adding: “Why is it, if they did this and were in cahoots with him, why weren’t why indicted?”

He added: “Their motivation, I’ve got my theories on it, but I haven’t seen one piece of evidence that links Jussie to this. What they do have is a whale of a case. If you believe what the police chief is saying, they’ve got a great case against the two brothers.

“They’ve got Lyft receipts, they’ve got ATM receipts, they’ve got a surveillance video, but what do they have that corroborates the story?

“What do they have, besides their word, that says he [Jussie] was in on this?”"

Sunday's devastating plane crash in Ethiopia could renew safety questions about the newest version of Boeing's popular 737 airliner.

The Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed shortly after taking off from the capital of Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board.

The plane was new. The weather was clear. Yet something was wrong, and the pilots tried to return to the airport. They never made it.

In those circumstances, the accident is eerily similar to an October crash in which a 737 Max 8 flown by Indonesia's Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 people on the plane. But safety experts cautioned against quickly drawing too many parallels between the two crashes.

William Waldock, an aviation-safety professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said suspicion will be raised because the same type of plane appeared to crash the same way - a fatal nosedive that left wreckage in tiny pieces.

Ethiopian Airlines crash kills 157, spreads global grief

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) - An Ethiopian Airlines jet faltered and crashed Sunday shortly after takeoff from the country's capital, carving a gash in the earth and spreading global grief to 35 countries that had someone among the 157 people who were killed.

There was no immediate indication why the plane went down in clear weather while on a flight to Nairobi, the capital of neighboring Kenya. The crash was strikingly similar to that of a Lion Air jet that plunged into the sea off Indonesia minutes after takeoff last year, killing 189 people. Both accidents involved the Boeing 737 Max 8.

The crash shattered more than two years of relative calm in African skies, where travel had long been chaotic. It also was a serious blow to state-owned Ethiopian Airlines, which has expanded to become the continent's largest and best-managed carrier and turned Addis Ababa into the gateway to Africa.

""Ethiopian Airlines is one of the safest airlines in the world. At this stage we cannot rule out anything,"" CEO Tewolde Gebremariam told reporters. He visited the crash site, standing in the gaping crater flecked with debris.

Black body bags were spread out nearby while Red Cross and other workers looked for remains. As the sun set, the airline's chief operating officer said the plane's flight data recorder had not yet been found.

Indonesian freed after murder charge dropped in Kim killing

SHAH ALAM, Malaysia (AP) - An Indonesian woman held two years on suspicion of killing the North Korean leader's half brother was freed from custody Monday after a Malaysian judge discharged the murder charge against her.

Immediately after the judgment, Siti Aisyah stood up in the dock, cried and hugged her co-defendant, Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam, before she left the courtroom. Huong was to have begun giving her defense in Monday's court session, after months of delay.

Huong's lawyer Hisham Teh Poh Teik told The Associated Press they will seek postponement of her trial. He said Huong was distressed and felt the ruling was unfair to her since the judge previously had found a murder case against them both should go forward.

Prosecutor Iskandar Ahmad said the discharge not amounting to acquittal means Aisyah can be recharged but there are no such plans for now. The reason for the withdrawal of the murder charge was not given.

The two young women were accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Kim's face in an airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 13, 2017. They have said they thought they were taking part in a prank for a TV show. They were the only suspects in custody after four North Korean suspects fled the country the same morning Kim was killed.

Misery grows for Venezuelans hit by power cuts

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - Venezuelans reached new levels of desperation Sunday as the country's worst blackouts took their toll, gathering in larger numbers than usual at springs in the mountains of Caracas to collect water and scrounging for scarce cash to pay for food in the few shops that were open.

Engineers restored power in some places after electricity and communications shut down nationwide Thursday evening, but outages persisted in many areas where people are already beset by hyperinflation as well as shortages of food and medicine.

Witnesses reported overnight protests and confrontations with police in a few Caracas neighborhoods and the remains of makeshift barricades and burned debris were seen at some intersections.

""If I could, I would take the little that I have and leave the country,"" said Renee Martinez, a 31-year-old Caracas resident. ""This is unbearable. Here, everything is scarce and now power is as well.""

People are often seen at mountain springs because they don't have running water at home and bottled water is too expensive, but hundreds crowded collection points Sunday. Some were there for the first time because water pumps weren't working without power.

Canada's no-sex, no-money scandal could topple Trudeau

TORONTO (AP) - There's no money, no sex and nothing illegal happened. This is what passes for a scandal in Canada.

U.S. President Donald Trump has been engulfed in allegations involving possible collusion with Russia and secret payments to buy the silence of a porn star. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing a controversy that seems trivial by comparison, but it could topple him in elections later this year.

Two high-profile women ministers in Trudeau's Cabinet, including Canada's first indigenous justice minister, resigned in protest, and his top aide and best friend quit too.

The former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, says Trudeau and senior members of his government pressured her in a case involving a major Canadian engineering company accused of corruption related to its business dealings in Libya. Trudeau reportedly leaned on the attorney general to instruct prosecutors to reach the equivalent of plea deal, which would avoid a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, because he felt that jobs were at stake.

""People south of the border would be astonished to think that this is the type of scandal that they have in Canada,"" said Eddie Goldenberg, a former adviser to former Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

Powell says Trump's attacks played no role in rate pause

WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says political attacks by President Donald Trump played no role in the Fed's decision in January to signal that it planned to take a pause in hiking interest rates. He also said in an interview broadcast Sunday that he can't be fired by the president and that he intends to serve out his full four-year term.

In a wide-ranging interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes,"" Powell said that the Fed decided to pause its rate hikes in January, after increasing rates four times in 2018, because the global economy was slowing and other risks to the U.S. economy were rising. The Fed said it planned to be ""patient"" in deciding when to change rates again.

Asked to define patient, Powell said, ""Patient means that we don't feel in any hurry to change our interest rate policy.""

At another point, Powell said the Fed felt its interest rate policy ""is in a very good place right now"" with the benchmark rate in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, which Powell said was ""roughly neutral,"" meaning the Fed's policy rate was not stimulating growth or holding it back.

""We think that's an appropriate place for an economy that has the lowest unemployment in 50 years, that has inflation right about at our 2 percent objective, that has returned significantly to good health,"" Powell said.

Trump budget sets up another battle over wall funding

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is reviving his border wall fight, preparing a new budget that will seek $8.6 billion for the U.S-Mexico barrier while imposing steep spending cuts to other domestic programs and setting the stage for another fiscal battle.

Budget documents are often seen as just a starting point of negotiation, but fresh off the longest government shutdown in history Trump's 2020 proposal shows he is eager to confront Congress again to reduce domestic spending and refocus money on his priorities. It calls for boosting defense spending and making $2.7 trillion in nondefense cuts.

Trump's proposal, titled ""A Budget for a Better America: Promises Kept. Taxpayers First"" and set for release Monday, ""embodies fiscal responsibility,"" said Russ Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Vought said the administration has ""prioritized reining in reckless Washington spending"" and shows ""we can return to fiscal sanity.""

Two administration officials confirmed that the border wall request was part of Trump's spending blueprint for the 2020 budget year, which begins Oct. 1.

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - A company run by a donor to President Donald Trump claimed it could provide Chinese clients with a chance to mingle and take photos with the president, along with access to his private club in Palm Beach, Florida.

It remains unclear how much Li Yang charged for the services and whether she was ever hired to provide them.

But the company's claims and other eyebrow-raising activity, which were first reported by The Miami Herald and Mother Jones, mark the latest in a litany of complications and ethical issues stemming from Trump continuing to own and operate a private club where dues-paying members and their guests rub shoulders with the president of the United States and his family, friends, White House staff and members of his Cabinet.

The Associated Press has previously reported that aides who accompany the president on frequent trips to the club are always on alert for club members and guests with nearly unlimited access who like to buttonhole the president. They raise pet projects, make policy suggestions and share oddball ideas ranging from the benefits of nuclear-powered cars to personal plans for Mideast peace.

Former administration officials have described the lengths to which aides have gone to try to run interference, including reserving the dinner table next to Trump's to keep as close an eye on him as possible and scanning guest lists for visitors who might prove problematic.

US Olympic cyclist Catlin found dead in her home at age 23

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) - Olympic track cyclist Kelly Catlin, who helped the U.S. women's pursuit team win the silver medal at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, died Friday at her home in California. She was 23.

USA Cycling chief executive Rob DeMartini said in a statement Sunday that ""the entire cycling community is mourning this immense loss. We are offering continuous support to Kelly's teammates, coaches and staff. We also encourage all those who knew Kelly to support each other through the grieving.""

Catlin's father, Mark Catlin, told VeloNews that his daughter killed herself.

Catlin was born and raised near Minneapolis, Minnesota, and rose to prominence on the track as a member of the U.S. national team. She also raced on the road for the Rally UHC Pro Cycling Team, and she was pursuing a graduate degree in computational mathematics at Stanford."

Actor Jussie Smollett indicted on 16 counts of lying to Chicago police

Television actor Jussie Smollett, arrested last month on a single charge of perpetrating a hate-crime hoax, has been newly indicted on 16 felony counts of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two strangers shouting racist and homophobic slurs. The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Chicago police investigating leaks in 'Empire' actor case

The Chicago Police Department has started an internal investigation into how information about an alleged hate crime attack against actor Jussie Smollett was anonymously leaked to journalists, police officials said. Smollett, 36, a black, openly gay actor on the hip-hop TV drama ""Empire,"" was charged with lying to police last month after he said he was attacked in January by two masked men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs. Detectives investigated the incident as a hate crime but local news outlets cited police sources saying it was believed to be a hoax."
22,https://www.theskanner.com/news/usa/28211-for-jussie-smollett-1-story-equals-16-felony-counts,,For Jussie Smollett 1 Story Equals 16 Felony Counts,['Don Babwin Associated Press'],https://www.theskanner.com/images/stories/2019/February/smollet-full.jpg,"['grand', 'attorney', 'count', 'jury', 'felony', 'chicago', 'prosecutors', 'men', 'judge', '16', 'equals', 'smollett', 'counts', 'jussie']","CHICAGO (AP) — News that a grand jury had indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday.

But legal experts say indictments like that aren't uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett's comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

""What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,"" said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, called the 16-count indictment ""prosecutorial overkill.""

But prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it's the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

""It is common practice for the Cook County state's attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,"" he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

""If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you're done,"" said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law.

""This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.""

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett's account into each of its individual pieces and accused him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett's contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him.

Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

""The lies add up pretty fast,"" Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won't matter whether it's on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That's because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

""If you add them all up it's still only one crime,"" Erickson said. ""That's just how it is.""

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett's legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed — a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if Smollett did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

""Lying to the FBI is a crime,"" said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" Geragos, his attorney, said."

Prosecutors had previously charged him with one count of filing a false report.

The 36-year-old African-American actor told police he had been the victim of a homophobic and racist assault.

Police say he staged the attack because he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary.

Last month he was suspended from the Empire TV show he starred in.

Sources told NBC and CNN Mr Smollett had apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence. What is Jussie Smollett accused of?

Mr Smollett is accused of paying two brothers to stage the attack. Chicago officials also believe that he sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand.

At an earlier hearing, a judge set the actor's bail at $100,000 (£76,000).

Mr Smollett, who was pictured outside the courthouse after posting bail, denies the charge of felony disorderly conduct.

His lawyers have said they will ""mount an aggressive defence"" of Mr Smollett, who they described as ""a young man of impeccable character"". What did he say had happened?

Mr Smollett said two white men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him when he went out late at night to buy food from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago on 29 January.

He said they then punched him, poured a potentially chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck - a reference to racist lynchings of African-Americans.

He also claimed the men said ""this is Maga country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"". How has the case unfolded?

Officers began to grow suspicious when they were unable to find any footage of the incident, despite reviewing more than 50 surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses.

But investigators say they managed to use a ride-sharing app to track and identify two brothers who were filmed near the scene.

The men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, flew to Nigeria after the alleged attack. On their return they were held for almost 48 hours.

Officials said they were released without charge after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"".

One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer, and both had worked as extras on Empire.

Police say they have a cheque, signed by Mr Smollett, which showed that he had agreed to pay the brothers $3,500.

Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Mr Smollett told at least one of the brothers that he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary on the show. According to the Huffington Post, he was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role.

In a press conference, Supt Johnson called the alleged scheme ""shameful"", adding: ""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?""

He also accused Mr Smollett of taking ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".

Mr Smollett turned himself in shortly afterwards.

Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 22

ADVERTISEMENT

Smollett receives a racist and homophobic threatening letter at the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed. Police later say that they believe Smollett sent the letter himself.

Jan. 29

Jussie Smollett tells police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

Feb. 19

Chicago police investigate tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution… to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.”

No details were provided. Foxx later says the reason for the recusal is that she had conversations with a Smollett family member after the incident was reported in late January.

Feb. 20

Chicago police say Smollett is officially suspected of filing a false police report when he said he was a victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago in January. Police also say that two brothers who were questioned about the attack were testifying before a grand jury and detectives were presenting evidence to the grand jury.

Chicago police say the Cook County State’s Attorney has charged Smollett with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report that he was attacked by two masked men. Police detectives were contacting Smollett’s attorneys to arrange his surrender for arrest.

Feb. 21

Chicago police say Smollett turned himself in to face a felony charge of disorderly conduct, which could bring up to three years in prison.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett staged a racist and homophobic attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted publicity. Investigators say they have a $3,500 check that Smollett used to pay the two brothers to help him.

Feb. 22

Producers of “Empire” say Jussie Smollett’s character will be removed from the final two episodes of this season.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the Fox network hip-hop drama “Empire,” was previously charged in a single-count criminal complaint with lying to police about a supposed racist and homophobic attack on Jan. 29 by supporters of President Donald Trump.A spokeswoman for Smollett, 36, who was arrested and later released on $100,000 bond two weeks ago in connection with the initial charge against him, did not immediately return a call or email seeking comment. An attorney for the actor could not immediately be reached for comment.

At least two local television stations reported that a Cook County grand jury charged Smollett with 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly giving false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators.

At the time he was initially charged, Chicago’s police chief said that Smollett had paid two brothers to stage an assault on him.

According to previous police accounts, Smollett reported that two masked men approached him on a darkened street shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

According to the account, the attackers had shouted, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Smollett took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police had said.

One week after his passionate make-out session with Kate Beckinsale, 45, at a New York Rangers Game on Mar. 3, Pete Davidson, 25, finally opened up about their romance on the Mar. 9 episode of SNL. Making an appearance on Weekend Update, Pete provided some advice for anyone wanting to comment on their 20-year age difference, saying, “Apparently people have a crazy fascination with our age difference. But it doesn’t really bother us, but then again, I’m new to this, so if you have questions about relationships with a big age difference just ask Leonardo DiCaprio, Jason Statham, Michael Douglas, Richard Gere, Jeff Goldblum, Scott Disick, Dane Cook, Derek Jeter, Bruce Willis, Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee, Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn and whoever the president of France is, Mel Gibson, Billy Joel, Mick Jagger, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy, Kelsey Grammer, Larry King, Larry King, Larry King, Rod Stewart and Donald Trump.” Well put, Pete!

We reported earlier how Pete’s friends wouldn’t be surprised if he popped the question to Kate soon. “Pete falls hard for girls he dates and that is something that is happening with Kate. So much so that Pete’s friends are first very happy for him that he has found someone that makes him feel really great and happy,” a source close to the Saturday Night Live comedian EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. “But [friends] are also concerned he might be diving into something too fast and too soon. But that is something that is in his nature to do in the first place, so they aren’t exactly surprised.”

Meanwhile, on the Feb. 28 episode, both Jussie Smollett and Robert Kraft‘s scandals were made fun of by the variety show. In a legal edition of Shark Tank, with sharks that included Michael Avenatti, Jeanine Pirro, Alan Dershowitz, Rudy Giuliani and jingle-based attorneys Cellino and Barnes, Jussie (played by Chris Redd) and Kraft (portrayed by Beck Bennett) pleaded for help with limited success.

Previously on the Feb. 10 episode, SNL tackled the blackface scandal that rocked Virginia after the state’s Governor and Attorney General admitting to using blackface as part of costumes. In the sketch, every Virginia state official copped up to using blackface at one point in their lives. As a frustrated Kenan Thompson attempted to run an ethics meeting, he was asked, “Does it count if you did it all the way back in the ’80s?” At one point, Halsey asked if Thompson if it was acceptable to wear blackface “if you’re half-black,” she then qualified her remarks by saying that by “half-black,” she meant dressing up as “both Michael Jacksons” for Halloween.

Kenan Thompson and Leslie Jones kicked off the opening sketch by spoofing Gayle King's explosive interview with R. Kelly.

The real interview, which aired Tuesday on ""CBS This Morning,"" was Kelly's first since his arrest on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. In the intense sit-down, Kelly devolved into hysterics, screaming and crying as he emphatically maintained his innocence and claimed his accusers were lying.

During the skit, Jones channeled King's much-praised composed nature, while Thompson brought Kelly's hysterics to the next comedic level.

""Just tell me why all those women would say the same things about you if they wasn't (sic) true?"" Jones said.

""You can start a rumor about any celebrity – just like that,"" Thompson's Kelly replied, snapping his fingers. ""All you've got to do is push a button on your phone, and say 'R. Kelly did this to me,' and then attach a video of me doing that thing, and people will believe you. It's scary.""

And just as Kelly did in the real interview, Thompson starts to get visibly upset, standing up from his chair and raising his voice as he tries to defend himself.

""Guys, think for a minute. Use your brains, why would I do these things?"" Thompson yelled. ""For 30 years, I gave y'all 'Trapped in the Closet,' 'Feelin' On Yo Booty,' 'Age Ain't Nothing but a Number' and so many other clues! And this is how you repay me? I don't have anybody left in my corner!""

Boeing likely to face new questions after another 737 crash

Sunday’s devastating plane crash in Ethiopia could renew safety questions about the newest version of Boeing’s popular 737 airliner.

The Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed shortly after taking off from the capital of Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board.

The plane was new. The weather was clear. Yet something was wrong, and the pilots tried to return to the airport. They never made it.

In those circumstances, the accident is eerily similar to an October crash in which a 737 Max 8 flown by Indonesia’s Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 people on the plane. But safety experts cautioned against quickly drawing too many parallels between the two crashes.

William Waldock, an aviation-safety professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said suspicion will be raised because the same type of plane appeared to crash the same way — a fatal nosedive that left wreckage in tiny pieces.

Ethiopian Airlines crash kills 157, spreads global grief

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — An Ethiopian Airlines jet faltered and crashed Sunday shortly after takeoff from the country’s capital, carving a gash in the earth and spreading global grief to 35 countries that had someone among the 157 people who were killed.

There was no immediate indication why the plane went down in clear weather while on a flight to Nairobi, the capital of neighboring Kenya. The crash was strikingly similar to that of a Lion Air jet that plunged into the sea off Indonesia minutes after takeoff last year, killing 189 people. Both accidents involved the Boeing 737 Max 8.

The crash shattered more than two years of relative calm in African skies, where travel had long been chaotic. It also was a serious blow to state-owned Ethiopian Airlines, which has expanded to become the continent’s largest and best-managed carrier and turned Addis Ababa into the gateway to Africa.

“Ethiopian Airlines is one of the safest airlines in the world. At this stage we cannot rule out anything,” CEO Tewolde Gebremariam told reporters. He visited the crash site, standing in the gaping crater flecked with debris.

Black body bags were spread out nearby while Red Cross and other workers looked for remains. As the sun set, the airline’s chief operating officer said the plane’s flight data recorder had not yet been found.

Indonesian freed after murder charge dropped in Kim killing

SHAH ALAM, Malaysia (AP) — An Indonesian woman held two years on suspicion of killing the North Korean leader’s half brother was freed from custody Monday after a Malaysian judge discharged the murder charge against her.

Immediately after the judgment, Siti Aisyah stood up in the dock, cried and hugged her co-defendant, Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam, before she left the courtroom. Huong was to have begun giving her defense in Monday’s court session, after months of delay.

Huong’s lawyer Hisham Teh Poh Teik told The Associated Press they will seek postponement of her trial. He said Huong was distressed and felt the ruling was unfair to her since the judge previously had found a murder case against them both should go forward.

Prosecutor Iskandar Ahmad said the discharge not amounting to acquittal means Aisyah can be recharged but there are no such plans for now. The reason for the withdrawal of the murder charge was not given.

The two young women were accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Kim’s face in an airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 13, 2017. They have said they thought they were taking part in a prank for a TV show. They were the only suspects in custody after four North Korean suspects fled the country the same morning Kim was killed.

Misery grows for Venezuelans hit by power cuts

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuelans reached new levels of desperation Sunday as the country’s worst blackouts took their toll, gathering in larger numbers than usual at springs in the mountains of Caracas to collect water and scrounging for scarce cash to pay for food in the few shops that were open.

Engineers restored power in some places after electricity and communications shut down nationwide Thursday evening, but outages persisted in many areas where people are already beset by hyperinflation as well as shortages of food and medicine.

Witnesses reported overnight protests and confrontations with police in a few Caracas neighborhoods and the remains of makeshift barricades and burned debris were seen at some intersections.

“If I could, I would take the little that I have and leave the country,” said Renee Martinez, a 31-year-old Caracas resident. “This is unbearable. Here, everything is scarce and now power is as well.”

People are often seen at mountain springs because they don’t have running water at home and bottled water is too expensive, but hundreds crowded collection points Sunday. Some were there for the first time because water pumps weren’t working without power.

Canada’s no-sex, no-money scandal could topple Trudeau

TORONTO (AP) — There’s no money, no sex and nothing illegal happened. This is what passes for a scandal in Canada.

U.S. President Donald Trump has been engulfed in allegations involving possible collusion with Russia and secret payments to buy the silence of a porn star. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing a controversy that seems trivial by comparison, but it could topple him in elections later this year.

Two high-profile women ministers in Trudeau’s Cabinet, including Canada’s first indigenous justice minister, resigned in protest, and his top aide and best friend quit too.

The former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, says Trudeau and senior members of his government pressured her in a case involving a major Canadian engineering company accused of corruption related to its business dealings in Libya. Trudeau reportedly leaned on the attorney general to instruct prosecutors to reach the equivalent of plea deal, which would avoid a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, because he felt that jobs were at stake.

“People south of the border would be astonished to think that this is the type of scandal that they have in Canada,” said Eddie Goldenberg, a former adviser to former Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

Powell says Trump’s attacks played no role in rate pause

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says political attacks by President Donald Trump played no role in the Fed’s decision in January to signal that it planned to take a pause in hiking interest rates. He also said in an interview broadcast Sunday that he can’t be fired by the president and that he intends to serve out his full four-year term.

In a wide-ranging interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Powell said that the Fed decided to pause its rate hikes in January, after increasing rates four times in 2018, because the global economy was slowing and other risks to the U.S. economy were rising. The Fed said it planned to be “patient” in deciding when to change rates again.

Asked to define patient, Powell said, “Patient means that we don’t feel in any hurry to change our interest rate policy.”

At another point, Powell said the Fed felt its interest rate policy “is in a very good place right now” with the benchmark rate in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, which Powell said was “roughly neutral,” meaning the Fed’s policy rate was not stimulating growth or holding it back.

“We think that’s an appropriate place for an economy that has the lowest unemployment in 50 years, that has inflation right about at our 2 percent objective, that has returned significantly to good health,” Powell said.

Trump budget sets up another battle over wall funding

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is reviving his border wall fight, preparing a new budget that will seek $8.6 billion for the U.S-Mexico barrier while imposing steep spending cuts to other domestic programs and setting the stage for another fiscal battle.

Budget documents are often seen as just a starting point of negotiation, but fresh off the longest government shutdown in history Trump’s 2020 proposal shows he is eager to confront Congress again to reduce domestic spending and refocus money on his priorities. It calls for boosting defense spending and making $2.7 trillion in nondefense cuts.

Trump’s proposal, titled “A Budget for a Better America: Promises Kept. Taxpayers First” and set for release Monday, “embodies fiscal responsibility,” said Russ Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Vought said the administration has “prioritized reining in reckless Washington spending” and shows “we can return to fiscal sanity.”

Two administration officials confirmed that the border wall request was part of Trump’s spending blueprint for the 2020 budget year, which begins Oct. 1.

Donor claimed Chinese clients could mingle with Trump

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — A company run by a donor to President Donald Trump claimed it could provide Chinese clients with a chance to mingle and take photos with the president, along with access to his private club in Palm Beach, Florida.

It remains unclear how much Li Yang charged for the services and whether she was ever hired to provide them.

But the company’s claims and other eyebrow-raising activity, which were first reported by The Miami Herald and Mother Jones, mark the latest in a litany of complications and ethical issues stemming from Trump continuing to own and operate a private club where dues-paying members and their guests rub shoulders with the president of the United States and his family, friends, White House staff and members of his Cabinet.

The Associated Press has previously reported that aides who accompany the president on frequent trips to the club are always on alert for club members and guests with nearly unlimited access who like to buttonhole the president. They raise pet projects, make policy suggestions and share oddball ideas ranging from the benefits of nuclear-powered cars to personal plans for Mideast peace.

Former administration officials have described the lengths to which aides have gone to try to run interference, including reserving the dinner table next to Trump’s to keep as close an eye on him as possible and scanning guest lists for visitors who might prove problematic.

US Olympic cyclist Catlin found dead in her home at age 23

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — Olympic track cyclist Kelly Catlin, who helped the U.S. women’s pursuit team win the silver medal at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, died Friday at her home in California. She was 23.

USA Cycling chief executive Rob DeMartini said in a statement Sunday that “the entire cycling community is mourning this immense loss. We are offering continuous support to Kelly’s teammates, coaches and staff. We also encourage all those who knew Kelly to support each other through the grieving.”

Catlin’s father, Mark Catlin, told VeloNews that his daughter killed herself.

Catlin was born and raised near Minneapolis, Minnesota, and rose to prominence on the track as a member of the U.S. national team. She also raced on the road for the Rally UHC Pro Cycling Team, and she was pursuing a graduate degree in computational mathematics at Stanford.

The Latest: China airlines told to ground Boeing 737 Max 8s

BEIJING (AP) — China’s civilian aviation authority has ordered all Chinese airlines to temporarily ground their Boeing 737 Max 8 planes after one of the aircraft crashed in Ethiopia.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China said the order was issued at 9 a.m. Beijing time Monday and would last nine hours.

It said the order was taken out of safety concerns because the crash was the second after another of the planes fell into the ocean off the coast of Indonesia in similar circumstances on Dec. 29, killing all aboard.

It said further notice would be issued after consultation with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing on safety measures taken.

Eight Chinese nationals were among the 157 people aboard the plane when it crashed Sunday shortly after takeoff.

MALAYSIA-NORTH KOREA

Indonesia freed after murder charge dropped in Kim killing

SHAH ALAM, Malaysia (AP) — An Indonesian woman has been freed after a Malaysian judge discharged the murder charge against her in the killing of the North Korean leader’s half brother.

The judge discharged Siti Aisyah without an acquittal after prosecutors said they wanted to withdraw the charge. They did not give a reason.

She was quickly ushered out of the courtroom and into a waiting car. An emotional Aisyah told reporters she had only learned Monday morning that she would be freed. “I am surprised and very happy.”

Indonesian Ambassador Rusdi Kirana said he was thankful to the Malaysian government.

A judge last August had found there was enough evidence to infer that Aisyah, Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong and four missing North Koreans had engaged in a conspiracy to kill Kim Jong Nam.

VENEZUELA-POLITICAL CRISIS

Electric power returns to part, but not all, of Venezuela

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Power has returned to some parts of Venezuela after several days of the country’s worst blackouts, but many areas remain without electricity and communications.

The massive outages have compounded the economic and political crisis in Venezuela, where the government and opposition accuse each other of being responsible for the infrastructure breakdown.

President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday tweeted that “multiple cyberattacks” caused the blackouts and disrupted efforts to fix the national grid. He says he hopes power can be restored in coming hours.

Opposition leader Juan Guaido and his ally, the United States, say Maduro’s allegations that they sabotaged the power system are absurd. They say government corruption and mismanagement caused the decay of Venezuela’s infrastructure over many years.

Venezuela is already struggling with hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine.

CANADA-TRUDEAU SCANDAL

Canada’s no-sex, no-money scandal could topple Trudeau

TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is engulfed in a no-money, no-sex scandal in which nothing illegal happened, but the fallout could topple him in the election this fall.

Two high-profile women in Trudeau’s Cabinet resigned in protest, and his top aide quit too. The ex-justice minister and attorney general says Trudeau and senior members of his government inappropriately tried to pressure her to instruct prosecutors to avoid criminal prosecution of a major Canadian engineering company.

Trudeau denies applying any inappropriate pressure and insists he and his officials were only pointing out that prosecution could endanger thousands of jobs. A conviction would make the company ineligible for government contracts.

The opposition Conservative leader has called on Trudeau to resign. Other Liberal lawmakers have expressed confidence in him.

TRUMP-BUDGET-THE LATEST

The Latest: Trump budget calls for return to ‘fiscal sanity’

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s 2020 budget seeks a return to what the administration calls “fiscal sanity,” cutting spending while focusing federal funding on defense and the U.S.-Mexico border.

That’s according to the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, who says the budget will be released Monday.

Vought said in a statement Sunday night that the document will outline the administration’s key funding priorities. They include boosting defense spending and adding resources to the border, while cutting nondefense by $2.7 trillion. There’s a 10 percent increase in spending on veterans and money to fight the opioid drug crisis.

Budget documents largely serve as starting points for negotiations and Trump’s proposal sets up another possible confrontation with Congress.

SUNSHINE WEEK-FADING LIGHT

Town by town, local journalism is dying in plain sight

WAYNESVILLE, Mo. (AP) — The local news industry is struggling from a decline in readers and advertising, especially in small towns across the US.

Over the past 15 years, more than 1,400 towns and cities have lost a newspaper. Among them are the twin towns of Waynesville and St. Robert in central Missouri’s Ozark hills.

The newspaper that served them closed last September, leaving residents without a source of regular news about their community.

The reasons for the closures vary. But the result is that many Americans no longer have someone watching the city council for them, chronicling the soccer exploits of their children or reporting on the kindly neighbor who died.

Natalie Sanders, a former editor, said that when the Daily Guide folded it felt like an old friend had died.

Moving for Sunshine Week, held annually to highlight journalism’s role in fighting for government transparency.

R KELLY-THE LATEST

The Latest: Lawyer: R. Kelly denies being on tape with girls

NEW YORK (AP) — An attorney representing R. Kelly says the R&B artist denies being on yet another videotape that allegedly appears to show him sexually abusing young girls.

Steve Greenberg tells The Associated Press on Sunday that he hasn’t seen the videotape that attorney Gloria Allred said one of her clients turned over to law enforcement.

Allred’s client, Gary Dennis, told reporters Sunday in New York that he doesn’t know Kelly and doesn’t know where the tape came from. Dennis said he came across it while cleaning out a collection he had for years.

Greenberg said the larger question is “what are these people doing possessing what they obviously believe is child pornography in their VHS collection and what the authorities are going to do.”

Greenberg also said that it’s “now just open season” on the singer who faces 10 counts in Chicago of aggravated sexual abuse in connection to three girls and one woman. Kelly has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty after being charged last month.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal budget deficit is ballooning on President Donald Trump’s watch and few in Washington seem to care.

And even if they did, the political dynamics that enabled bipartisan deficit-cutting deals decades ago has disappeared, replaced by bitter partisanship and chronic dysfunction.

That’s the reality that will greet Trump’s latest budget , which will promptly be shelved after landing with a thud on Monday. Like previous spending blueprints, Trump’s plan for the 2020 budget year will propose cuts to many domestic programs favoured by lawmakers in both parties but leave alone politically popular retirement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

Washington probably will devote months to wrestling over erasing the last remnants of a failed 2011 budget deal that would otherwise cut core Pentagon operations by $71 billion and domestic agencies and foreign aid by $55 billion. Top lawmakers are pushing for a reprise of three prior deals to use spending cuts or new revenues and prop up additional spending rather than defray deficits that are again approaching $1 trillion.

It’s put deficit hawks in a gloomy mood.

For Jussie Smollett, 1 story equals 16 felony counts

CHICAGO (AP) — News that a grand jury had indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren’t uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett’s comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

“What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,” said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defence attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

R. Kelly: ‘We’re going to straighten all this stuff out’

CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly walked out of a Chicago jail on Saturday after someone who officials say did not want to be publicly identified paid $161,633 that the R&B singer owed in back child support.

Kelly, who was ordered taken into custody on Wednesday by a judge after Kelly said he didn’t have the entire amount he owed, briefly spoke with reporters, telling them: “I promise you, we’re going to straighten all this stuff out.” He said that was all he could say, a stark contrast to a nationally televised broadcast that aired earlier in the week in which he cried and ranted about being “assassinated” by allegations of sexual abuse that led to criminal charges last month.

Cara Smith, the chief policy officer for the Cook County sheriff’s office, which runs the jail, said a person who wished to remain anonymous handed a check on Saturday morning to the county clerk’s office for the full amount of Kelly’s back child support. A bond slip where people putting up money to secure an inmate’s release write their names and relationship to the inmate was left blank, Smith said.

Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, said he could not discuss the child support payment because of a judge’s gag order in that case.

As is done with other high-profile inmates, Kelly, 52, was held in a solo cell under round-the-clock observation.

Pot-litics: 2020 Democrats line up behind legalization

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A growing list of Democratic presidential contenders want the U.S. government to legalize marijuana, reflecting a nationwide shift as more Americans look favourably on cannabis.

Making marijuana legal at the federal level is the “smart thing to do,” says California Sen. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor whose home state is the nation’s largest legal pot shop. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a prominent legalization advocate on Capitol Hill, says the war on drugs has been a “war on people.”

Former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke, who appears poised to join the 2020 Democratic field, has written a book arguing marijuana legalization would hobble drug cartels. In an email to supporters this week, he called again to end the federal prohibition on marijuana.

“Who is going to be the last man — more likely than not a black man — to languish behind bars for possessing or using marijuana when it is legal in some form in more than half of the states in this country?” O’Rourke wrote.

It’s a far different approach from the not-so-distant past, when it was seen as politically damaging to acknowledge smoking pot and no major presidential candidate backed legalization.

NEW YORK (AP) — Severe turbulence over the Atlantic Ocean tossed terrified passengers and crew around a Turkish Airlines plane cabin on Saturday, with 30 people suffering bumps, bruises, cuts and a broken leg before the flight landed safely at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, officials said.

Dozens of ambulances lined up in front of a terminal to quickly treat the injured coming off the flight that left Istanbul for the 10-hour trip.

Spokesman Steve Coleman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told The Associated Press that 28 people were taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens after the plane touched down at 5:35 p.m. Two went to Queens Hospital Medical Center. A flight attendant suffered a broken leg, Coleman said.

Turkish Airlines Flight 1 hit the turbulence about 45 minutes before landing at JFK, Coleman said. The crew declared an emergency while the Boeing 777 was still in the air, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

The Port Authority spokesman said other airport operations were not affected.

Trump signed Bibles. Heresy? Many religious leaders say no

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — President Donald Trump was just doing what he could to raise spirits when he signed Bibles at an Alabama church for survivors of a tornado outbreak, many religious leaders say, though some are offended and others say he could have handled it differently.

Hershael York, dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary School of Theology in Louisville, Kentucky, said he didn’t have a problem with Trump signing Bibles, like former presidents have, because he was asked and because it was important to the people who were asking.

“Though we don’t have a national faith, there is faith in our nation, and so it’s not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their Bibles,” he said. “Those Bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are, too.”

But the Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, said she was offended by the way Trump scrawled his signature Friday as he autographed Bibles and other things, including hats, and posed for photos. She viewed it, she said, as a “calculated political move” by the Republican president to court his evangelical voting base.

Presidents have a long history of signing Bibles, though earlier presidents typically signed them as gifts to send with a spiritual message. President Ronald Reagan signed a Bible that was sent secretly to Iranian officials in 1986. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the family Bible his attorney general used to take the oath of office in 1939.

Wanted: More pastures for West’s overpopulated wild horses

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — If you ever wished to gaze at a stomping, snorting, neighing panorama of Western heritage from your living-room window, now could be your chance.

A classic image of the American West — wild horses stampeding across the landscape — not only has endured through the years but has multiplied past the point of range damage. Through May 3, the U.S. government is seeking more private pastures for an overpopulation of wild horses.

Many consider rounding up wild horses to live out their lives on private pastures a reasonable approach to a tricky problem. Wild horses, after all, not only have romantic value, they are protected by federal law.

Just keep in mind a few of the dozens of requirements for getting paid by the government to provide wild horses a home.

“It’s not like you can do this in your backyard, or even a 5 acre (2 hectare) plot,” said Debbie Collins, outreach specialist for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Wild Horse and Burro Program in Norman, Oklahoma.

More blackouts hit Venezuela as opposition, government rally

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The Venezuelan opposition and government loyalists held rival demonstrations in Caracas on Saturday, as both sides prepared for what some fear could be a protracted power struggle.

The rallies unfolded as power and communications outages continued to hit Venezuela, intensifying the hardship of a country paralyzed by economic and political crisis. The blackouts heightened tension between the bitterly divided factions, which accused each other of being responsible for the collapse of the power grid.

“Hard times are ahead,” said opposition leader Juan Guaido, who addressed crowds with a loudspeaker after security forces earlier dismantled a speakers’ stage that the opposition had erected. He said he planned to tour Venezuela to seek support and lay the groundwork for a massive rally in Caracas.

The 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly said he anticipated more government efforts to sideline and intimidate the opposition. However, President Nicolas Maduro’s government has not moved directly against Guaido since he returned to Venezuela from a Latin American tour Monday.

Guaido earlier speculated that Maduro was effectively ignoring him in an attempt to sap the energy of the opposition, whose hopes of ousting the government have so far been stymied.

AP Explains: What Facebook’s ‘privacy vision’ really means

NEW YORK (AP) — Mark Zuckerberg’s abrupt Wednesday declaration of a new “privacy vision ” for social networking was for many people a sort of Rorschach test.

Looked at one way, the manifesto read as an apology of sorts for Facebook’s history of privacy transgressions, and suggested that the social network would de-emphasize its huge public social network in favour of private messaging between individuals and among small groups.

Looked at another, it turned Facebook into a kind of privacy champion by embracing encrypted messaging that’s shielded from prying eyes — including those of Facebook itself.

Yet another reading suggested the whole thing was a public-relations exercise designed to lull its users while Facebook entrenches its competitive position in messaging and uses it to develop new sources of user data to feed its voracious advertising machine.

As with many things Facebook, the truth lies somewhere in between. Facebook so far isn’t elaborating much on Zuckerberg’s manifesto. Here’s a guide to what we know at the moment about its plans.

Town by town, local journalism is dying in plain sight

WAYNESVILLE, Mo. (AP) — The local news industry is struggling from a decline in readers and advertising, especially in small towns across the US.

Over the past 15 years, more than 1,400 towns and cities have lost a newspaper. Among them are the twin towns of Waynesville and St. Robert in central Missouri’s Ozark hills.

The newspaper that served them closed last September, leaving residents without a source of regular news about their community.

The reasons for the closures vary. But the result is that many Americans no longer have someone watching the city council for them, chronicling the soccer exploits of their children or reporting on the kindly neighbour who died.

Natalie Sanders, a former editor, said that when the Daily Guide folded it felt like an old friend had died.

As budget deficit balloons, few in Washington seem to care

WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal budget deficit is ballooning on President Donald Trump's watch and few in Washington seem to care.

And even if they did, the political dynamics that enabled bipartisan deficit-cutting deals decades ago has disappeared, replaced by bitter partisanship and chronic dysfunction.

That's the reality that will greet Trump's latest budget , which will promptly be shelved after landing with a thud on Monday. Like previous spending blueprints, Trump's plan for the 2020 budget year will propose cuts to many domestic programs favoured by lawmakers in both parties but leave alone politically popular retirement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

Washington probably will devote months to wrestling over erasing the last remnants of a failed 2011 budget deal that would otherwise cut core Pentagon operations by $71 billion and domestic agencies and foreign aid by $55 billion. Top lawmakers are pushing for a reprise of three prior deals to use spending cuts or new revenues and prop up additional spending rather than defray deficits that are again approaching $1 trillion.

It's put deficit hawks in a gloomy mood.

Town by town, local journalism is dying in plain sight

WAYNESVILLE, Mo. (AP) — Five minutes late, Darrell Todd Maurina sweeps into a meeting room and plugs in his laptop computer. He places a Wi-Fi hotspot on the table and turns on a digital recorder. The earplug in his left ear is attached to a police scanner in his pants pocket.

He wears a tie; Maurina insists upon professionalism.

He is the press — in its entirety.

Maurina, who posts his work to Facebook, is the only person who has come to the Pulaski County courthouse to tell residents what their commissioners are up to, the only one who will report on their deliberations — specifically, their discussions about how to satisfy the Federal Emergency Management Agency so it will pay to repair a road inundated during a 2013 flood.

Last September, Waynesville became a statistic. With the shutdown of its newspaper, the Daily Guide, this town of 5,200 people in central Missouri's Ozark hills joined more than 1,400 other cities and towns across the U.S. to lose a newspaper over the past 15 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of data compiled by the University of North Carolina.

For Jussie Smollett, 1 story equals 16 felony counts

CHICAGO (AP) — News that a grand jury had indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren't uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett's comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

""What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,"" said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, called the 16-count indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" But prominent Chicago defence attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it's the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

North Korea goes to polls to rubber-stamp parliament lineup

PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) — Millions of North Korean voters, including leader Kim Jong Un, went to the polls on Sunday to elect a new lineup of roughly 700 members for the next session of the national legislature, though the vote was more of an endorsement than a competitive contest.

Voters were presented with just one state-sanctioned candidate per seat and cast their ballots not to select but rather to show their approval or, at least theoretically, disapproval of that candidate.

The elections, last held in 2014, are for the entire Supreme People's Assembly, which on paper is the highest organ of power in North Korea. Its delegates come from all over the country and all walks of life. The candidates are selected by the ruling Korean Workers' Party and a couple of other smaller coalition parties that have seats in the assembly.

Kim, fresh off his trip to Hanoi for his second summit with President Donald Trump, is a member of the assembly, though his power rests in his complete control over the ruling party, government and military. State media showed footage of him casting his vote at a polling centre at Pyongyang's Kim Chaek University of Technology.

As was the custom in the Soviet Union and other communist countries, turnout is generally reported at 99 per cent or higher. Voting is generally regarded as a duty and responsibility. Simply staying at home is not an option.

Mexico's leftist president creates new style of government

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's first 100 days in office have combined a compulsive shedding of presidential trappings with a dizzying array of policy initiatives, and a series of missteps haven't even dented his soaring approval ratings.

Lopez Obrador has answered more questions from the press, flown in more economy-class flights, posed for more selfies with admiring citizens and visited more genuinely risky areas with little or no security than several combined decades of his predecessors. He's also surprised many by maintaining a cordial relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, helping contain Central American migrant caravans while resisting U.S. efforts to oust the leftist government of Venezuela.

The folksy perennial candidate took office Dec. 1 and by the end of his first month in office, Lopez Obrador's approval rating surpassed 80 per cent. He has taken full advantage of that mandate to move quickly on many fronts — perhaps too many.

""Every week he announces at least one or two things,"" said Ivonne Acuna Murillo, a professor of political science at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. ""Sometimes the speed of the issues he is putting on the agenda is such that an issue they put out in the morning is displaced by another in the afternoon.""

Before Lopez Obrador had even taken office he held a referendum on the partially constructed $13 billion Mexico City airport. He used the resulting vote as a green light to cancel a project he had campaigned against.

As newspapers close, role of government watchdog disappears

One of the last investigations Jim Boren oversaw before he retired as executive editor of The Fresno Bee was a four-month examination of substandard housing in the city at the heart of California's Central Valley.

The multimedia project revealed the living conditions imposed on many of the city's low-income renters, many of them immigrants: apartments filled with mould, mice and cockroaches, to name some of the more glaring problems. Local housing advocates compared it to the tainted water crisis in Flint, Michigan.

The investigation got immediate results.

""We made people's lives better. We changed laws,"" said Boren, who retired in 2017 and is now director of the Institute for Media and Public Trust at Fresno State University.

Among other things, the city responded by requiring property owners to make repairs when it found violations, rather than just levy fines.

Pot-litics: 2020 Democrats line up behind legalization

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A growing list of Democratic presidential contenders want the U.S. government to legalize marijuana, reflecting a nationwide shift as more Americans look favourably on cannabis.

Making marijuana legal at the federal level is the ""smart thing to do,"" says California Sen. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor whose home state is the nation's largest legal pot shop. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a prominent legalization advocate on Capitol Hill, says the war on drugs has been a ""war on people.""

Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, who appears poised to join the 2020 Democratic field, has written a book arguing marijuana legalization would hobble drug cartels. In an email to supporters this week, he called again to end the federal prohibition on marijuana.

""Who is going to be the last man — more likely than not a black man — to languish behind bars for possessing or using marijuana when it is legal in some form in more than half of the states in this country?"" O'Rourke wrote.

It's a far different approach from the not-so-distant past, when it was seen as politically damaging to acknowledge smoking pot and no major presidential candidate backed legalization.

Turbulence injures 30 on flight from Istanbul to New York

R. Kelly: 'We're going to straighten all this stuff out'

CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly walked out of a Chicago jail on Saturday after someone who officials say did not want to be publicly identified paid $161,633 that the R&B singer owed in back child support.

Kelly, who was ordered taken into custody on Wednesday by a judge after Kelly said he didn't have the entire amount he owed, briefly spoke with reporters, telling them: ""I promise you, we're going to straighten all this stuff out."" He said that was all he could say, a stark contrast to a nationally televised broadcast that aired earlier in the week in which he cried and ranted about being ""assassinated"" by allegations of sexual abuse that led to criminal charges last month.

Cara Smith, the chief policy officer for the Cook County sheriff's office, which runs the jail, said a person who wished to remain anonymous handed a check on Saturday morning to the county clerk's office for the full amount of Kelly's back child support. A bond slip where people putting up money to secure an inmate's release write their names and relationship to the inmate was left blank, Smith said.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, said he could not discuss the child support payment because of a judge's gag order in that case.

As is done with other high-profile inmates, Kelly, 52, was held in a solo cell under round-the-clock observation."

Washington probably will devote months to wrestling over erasing the last remnants of a failed 2011 budget deal that would otherwise cut core Pentagon operations by $71 billion and domestic agencies and foreign aid by $55 billion. Top lawmakers are pushing for a reprise of three prior deals to use spending cuts or new revenues and prop up additional spending rather than defray deficits that are again approaching $1 trillion.

It’s put deficit hawks in a gloomy mood.

For Jussie Smollett, 1 story equals 16 felony counts

CHICAGO (AP) — News that a grand jury had indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren’t uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett’s comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

“What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,” said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defence attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

R. Kelly: ‘We’re going to straighten all this stuff out’

CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly walked out of a Chicago jail on Saturday after someone who officials say did not want to be publicly identified paid $161,633 that the R&B singer owed in back child support.

Kelly, who was ordered taken into custody on Wednesday by a judge after Kelly said he didn’t have the entire amount he owed, briefly spoke with reporters, telling them: “I promise you, we’re going to straighten all this stuff out.” He said that was all he could say, a stark contrast to a nationally televised broadcast that aired earlier in the week in which he cried and ranted about being “assassinated” by allegations of sexual abuse that led to criminal charges last month.

Cara Smith, the chief policy officer for the Cook County sheriff’s office, which runs the jail, said a person who wished to remain anonymous handed a check on Saturday morning to the county clerk’s office for the full amount of Kelly’s back child support. A bond slip where people putting up money to secure an inmate’s release write their names and relationship to the inmate was left blank, Smith said.

Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, said he could not discuss the child support payment because of a judge’s gag order in that case.

As is done with other high-profile inmates, Kelly, 52, was held in a solo cell under round-the-clock observation.

Pot-litics: 2020 Democrats line up behind legalization

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A growing list of Democratic presidential contenders want the U.S. government to legalize marijuana, reflecting a nationwide shift as more Americans look favourably on cannabis.

Making marijuana legal at the federal level is the “smart thing to do,” says California Sen. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor whose home state is the nation’s largest legal pot shop. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a prominent legalization advocate on Capitol Hill, says the war on drugs has been a “war on people.”

Former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke, who appears poised to join the 2020 Democratic field, has written a book arguing marijuana legalization would hobble drug cartels. In an email to supporters this week, he called again to end the federal prohibition on marijuana.

“Who is going to be the last man — more likely than not a black man — to languish behind bars for possessing or using marijuana when it is legal in some form in more than half of the states in this country?” O’Rourke wrote.

It’s a far different approach from the not-so-distant past, when it was seen as politically damaging to acknowledge smoking pot and no major presidential candidate backed legalization.

Turbulence injures 30 on flight from Istanbul to New York

NEW YORK (AP) — Severe turbulence over the Atlantic Ocean tossed terrified passengers and crew around a Turkish Airlines plane cabin on Saturday, with 30 people suffering bumps, bruises, cuts and a broken leg before the flight landed safely at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, officials said.

Dozens of ambulances lined up in front of a terminal to quickly treat the injured coming off the flight that left Istanbul for the 10-hour trip.

Spokesman Steve Coleman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told The Associated Press that 28 people were taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens after the plane touched down at 5:35 p.m. Two went to Queens Hospital Medical Center. A flight attendant suffered a broken leg, Coleman said.

Turkish Airlines Flight 1 hit the turbulence about 45 minutes before landing at JFK, Coleman said. The crew declared an emergency while the Boeing 777 was still in the air, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

The Port Authority spokesman said other airport operations were not affected.

Trump signed Bibles. Heresy? Many religious leaders say no

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — President Donald Trump was just doing what he could to raise spirits when he signed Bibles at an Alabama church for survivors of a tornado outbreak, many religious leaders say, though some are offended and others say he could have handled it differently.

Hershael York, dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary School of Theology in Louisville, Kentucky, said he didn’t have a problem with Trump signing Bibles, like former presidents have, because he was asked and because it was important to the people who were asking.

“Though we don’t have a national faith, there is faith in our nation, and so it’s not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their Bibles,” he said. “Those Bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are, too.”

But the Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, said she was offended by the way Trump scrawled his signature Friday as he autographed Bibles and other things, including hats, and posed for photos. She viewed it, she said, as a “calculated political move” by the Republican president to court his evangelical voting base.

Presidents have a long history of signing Bibles, though earlier presidents typically signed them as gifts to send with a spiritual message. President Ronald Reagan signed a Bible that was sent secretly to Iranian officials in 1986. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the family Bible his attorney general used to take the oath of office in 1939.

Wanted: More pastures for West’s overpopulated wild horses

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — If you ever wished to gaze at a stomping, snorting, neighing panorama of Western heritage from your living-room window, now could be your chance.

A classic image of the American West — wild horses stampeding across the landscape — not only has endured through the years but has multiplied past the point of range damage. Through May 3, the U.S. government is seeking more private pastures for an overpopulation of wild horses.

Many consider rounding up wild horses to live out their lives on private pastures a reasonable approach to a tricky problem. Wild horses, after all, not only have romantic value, they are protected by federal law.

Just keep in mind a few of the dozens of requirements for getting paid by the government to provide wild horses a home.

“It’s not like you can do this in your backyard, or even a 5 acre (2 hectare) plot,” said Debbie Collins, outreach specialist for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Wild Horse and Burro Program in Norman, Oklahoma.

More blackouts hit Venezuela as opposition, government rally

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The Venezuelan opposition and government loyalists held rival demonstrations in Caracas on Saturday, as both sides prepared for what some fear could be a protracted power struggle.

The rallies unfolded as power and communications outages continued to hit Venezuela, intensifying the hardship of a country paralyzed by economic and political crisis. The blackouts heightened tension between the bitterly divided factions, which accused each other of being responsible for the collapse of the power grid.

“Hard times are ahead,” said opposition leader Juan Guaido, who addressed crowds with a loudspeaker after security forces earlier dismantled a speakers’ stage that the opposition had erected. He said he planned to tour Venezuela to seek support and lay the groundwork for a massive rally in Caracas.

The 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly said he anticipated more government efforts to sideline and intimidate the opposition. However, President Nicolas Maduro’s government has not moved directly against Guaido since he returned to Venezuela from a Latin American tour Monday.

Guaido earlier speculated that Maduro was effectively ignoring him in an attempt to sap the energy of the opposition, whose hopes of ousting the government have so far been stymied.

AP Explains: What Facebook’s ‘privacy vision’ really means

NEW YORK (AP) — Mark Zuckerberg’s abrupt Wednesday declaration of a new “privacy vision ” for social networking was for many people a sort of Rorschach test.

Looked at one way, the manifesto read as an apology of sorts for Facebook’s history of privacy transgressions, and suggested that the social network would de-emphasize its huge public social network in favour of private messaging between individuals and among small groups.

Looked at another, it turned Facebook into a kind of privacy champion by embracing encrypted messaging that’s shielded from prying eyes — including those of Facebook itself.

Yet another reading suggested the whole thing was a public-relations exercise designed to lull its users while Facebook entrenches its competitive position in messaging and uses it to develop new sources of user data to feed its voracious advertising machine.

As with many things Facebook, the truth lies somewhere in between. Facebook so far isn’t elaborating much on Zuckerberg’s manifesto. Here’s a guide to what we know at the moment about its plans.

Town by town, local journalism is dying in plain sight

WAYNESVILLE, Mo. (AP) — The local news industry is struggling from a decline in readers and advertising, especially in small towns across the US.

Over the past 15 years, more than 1,400 towns and cities have lost a newspaper. Among them are the twin towns of Waynesville and St. Robert in central Missouri’s Ozark hills.

The newspaper that served them closed last September, leaving residents without a source of regular news about their community.

The reasons for the closures vary. But the result is that many Americans no longer have someone watching the city council for them, chronicling the soccer exploits of their children or reporting on the kindly neighbour who died.

Natalie Sanders, a former editor, said that when the Daily Guide folded it felt like an old friend had died.

Looked at another, it turned Facebook into a kind of privacy champion by embracing encrypted messaging that’s shielded from prying eyes — including those of Facebook itself.

Yet another reading suggested the whole thing was a public-relations exercise designed to lull its users while Facebook entrenches its competitive position in messaging and uses it to develop new sources of user data to feed its voracious advertising machine.

As with many things Facebook, the truth lies somewhere in between. Facebook so far isn’t elaborating much on Zuckerberg’s manifesto. Here’s a guide to what we know at the moment about its plans.

Town by town, local journalism is dying in plain sight

WAYNESVILLE, Mo. (AP) — The local news industry is struggling from a decline in readers and advertising, especially in small towns across the US.

Over the past 15 years, more than 1,400 towns and cities have lost a newspaper. Among them are the twin towns of Waynesville and St. Robert in central Missouri’s Ozark hills.

The newspaper that served them closed last September, leaving residents without a source of regular news about their community.

The reasons for the closures vary. But the result is that many Americans no longer have someone watching the city council for them, chronicling the soccer exploits of their children or reporting on the kindly neighbour who died.

Natalie Sanders, a former editor, said that when the Daily Guide folded it felt like an old friend had died.

""I'm a fan,"" said Rick Hess, an education expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Hess noted that universities get roughly $40 billion in research funds each year, a point of leverage for the Trump administration, which could easily add language regulating university treatment of speakers into existing contracts.

The administration has not released text for the executive order, making it a matter of speculation how it will work. Trump announced the order last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference, saying only that it would require universities to support ""free speech"" if they wanted to continue receiving federal research dollars.

Federal agencies routinely give universities funds to perform research for them as subcontractors. Research dollars come with contract obligations, and a free speech requirement would merely be an addendum.

Hess said that if the Trump executive order required federal agencies to stipulate in their research contracts with universities that the institution must uphold free speech, the order would only be making explicit what is already an implicit understanding between agencies and universities.

Federal agencies have a range of options for enforcing research funding rules, including: withholding payments, terminating the contract, putting the entity on a suspension list for future contracts, or even suing for violation of rules. Trump could decide in his executive order to either dictate how federal agencies will enforce a free speech requirement or delegate the specifics to federal agencies to determine the best way to enforce the rule.

Adam Kissel, visiting scholar at the American University Center for Innovation and the former vice president at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an organization that opposes campus censorship, agreed that an executive order could be effective. “Even if the order does the minimum, it will dramatically change incentives for universities to finally abolish their speech codes, freeing millions of students and faculty members across the whole political spectrum,” he said.

FIRE, which monitors universities and tracks when they disinvite speakers because of controversy, found that almost a third of universities in 2018 maintained “speech codes that clearly and substantially restrict freedom of speech.” FIRE’s report concluded that another 58 percent of universities had policies vague enough to suppress constitutionally protected speech.

University of California, Berkeley president Janet Napolitano, however, spoke out against the proposed executive order Monday, saying that it was superfluous.

“Free speech is a fundamental value of the University of California and we already have strong policies in place that protect the free expression of ideas, regardless of political persuasion,” Napolitano said in a statement. “Protecting free expression has been part of the University of California’s DNA for decades. We do not need the federal government to mandate free speech on college campuses — that tradition is alive and thriving.”

Berkeley came under the scrutiny of Trump for an incident last month in which a conservative activist was punched for protesting Jussie Smollett's alleged hate crime hoax. Trump, in his speech at CPAC, brought on stage Hayden Williams, the person who had been punched.

The incident involving Williams was not the first time Berkeley had come under fire for not protecting speech on campus. In 2014, Berkeley student protesters shut down a question-and-answer session by Silicon Valley tycoon Peter Thiel for his views on National Security Agency surveillance. Most recently, the university came under a microscope in 2017 when right-wing instigator Milo Yiannopoulos planned to come to campus but canceled the speech after violent protests broke out.

Napolitano was not the only university president to condemn Trump’s proposal. The president of the University of Chicago, Robert Zimmer, also put out a statement Monday in which he said that “further legislative or executive Federal action has the potential to reinforce and expand the difficulties regarding education and free expression that we are confronting now. It would be a grave error for the short and the long run.”

Hess said he was concerned that, because the proposal lacks specifics, Trump’s final product might not line up with what his own vision for the executive order looked like. “It’s Trump, so who the hell knows what the idea is,” he said."

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct – the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police – are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren’t uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett’s comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

“What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,” said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

“It is common practice for the Cook County state’s attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,” he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

“If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you’re done,” said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. “This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.”

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett’s account into each individual pieces and accuse him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett’s contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

“The lies add up pretty fast,” Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won’t matter whether it’s on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That’s because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

“If you add them all up it’s still only one crime,” Erickson said. “That’s just how it is.”

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett’s legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed – a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if Smollett did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

“Lying to the FBI is a crime,” said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he likely will enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Geragos, his attorney, said.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the Fox network hip-hop drama “Empire,” was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with lying to police about a supposed racist and homophobic attack by supporters of President Donald Trump.

Neither Smollett’s attorney nor his spokeswoman could immediately be reached for comment on the latest charges.

At the time he was initially charged, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett had paid two brothers $35,000 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career. Smollett, 36, was arrested and later released on $100,000 bond two weeks ago in connection with the initial charge against him.

The indictment, returned by a grand jury on Thursday (March 7), charges Smollett with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging that he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators. A copy of the document was furnished to Reuters by a Cook County Circuit Court clerk."

At a SXSW panel hosted by CNN’s Jake Tapper, Trevor Noah described how the acceleration of culture has really fucked late-night comedy: “When we started … the news cycle had a certain cadence to it. There was a rhythm. You knew that at a certain time there’d be no news, so you could compile your stories and create your show,” he said. “Now, there’s the 5:30 curse, we call it. At 5:30 p.m., somebody’s getting indicted, some tweet is coming out, somebody is getting into some scandal. Something is going to happen.” This has been a constant in the Trump administration, late-in-the-day news dumps. Every day is that season 1 West Wing episode, “Take Out the Trash Day” for Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The Daily Show’s solution is to lean into the problem, throw out what they’d spent that day writing, and come up with something new when crazy news hits. An example cited at the panel was when the Jussie Smollett news broke, according to Deadline. During the 2020 election, Noah said that the show will focus on policy rather than any particular outrage of the day. “Going into 2020, [we’re going to be] giving you an accurate representation of what is happening in the race, and what the candidates actually stand for, and how it will affect your life,” he said."

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren’t uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett’s comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

“What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,” said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

“It is common practice for the Cook County state’s attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,” he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

“If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you’re done,” said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. “This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.”

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett’s account into each individual pieces and accuse him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett’s contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

“The lies add up pretty fast,” Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won’t matter whether it’s on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That’s because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

“If you add them all up it’s still only one crime,” Erickson said. “That’s just how it is.”

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett’s legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed — a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if Smollett did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

“Lying to the FBI is a crime,” said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Geragos, his attorney, said."

This is after Smollett was arrested last month, and was charged with one count of falsifying a police report. The judge granted a $100,000 bail, and Smollett paid a $10,000 bond. He was also asked to give up his passport, and he remains under supervision until his case is adjudicated.

Illinois law states: ""A person commits disorderly conduct when he or she knowingly ... (4) Transmits or causes to be transmitted in any manner to any peace officer, public officer or public employee a report to the effect that an offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed, knowing at the time of the transmission that there is no reasonable ground for believing that the offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed.""

The felony counts piled on as the Cook County grand jury counted each part of his report separately. According to Vox, this means that the actor ""could face up to 64 years in prison if convicted, with each of the 16 charges carrying a possible sentence that ranges from probation to four years in jail."" He remains out on bail pending an arraignment Thursday.

Chicago Police Department (CPD) spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi retweeted The Wall Street Journal's report on the indictment, and said, ""As Superintendent [Eddie] Johnson stated, allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model. We stand behind the work of detectives & refer any comment on indictment to prosecutors.""

Jussie's attorney Mark Geragos, who has defended other celebrities with criminal charges like Chris Brown and Michael Jackson, maintains that his client is innocent. Geragos is calling the sixteen-count indictment ""prosecutorial overkill"" and a ""desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal [CPD] investigation launched to investigate the ... leaking of false information"" regarding the Smollett probe.

Geragos is also complaining about the employees at Northwestern Hospital, where Jussie was checked into after the alleged attack. According to the lawyer, the employees performed a ""shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records."" Dozens of employees have already been fired from the hospital for ""improperly accessing the actor's medical records"" as reported by to CBS Chicago affiliate WBBM.

The Chicago Sun-Times has reported that the Chicago Police is currently conducting an internal investigation into the leaks.

According to CNN, ""The producers behind Empire decided to remove Smollett's character, Jamal, from the final two episodes of the season. The decision was made to 'avoid further disruption on set.'"""

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of US President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama Empire, was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as ""redundant and vindictive"", adding that his client ""adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption"".

He also said that leveling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defense cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $35,000 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

No further arrest

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on Feb. 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week's indictment ""because it's the same case,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett's claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett's story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor's defense.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologized last month to the cast and crew on the set of Empire but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, ""to distract from the internal investigation"".

Empire debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show's current season."

The indictment and the number of felonies Smollett was charged with is a significant increase from the original charges against him made by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Feb. 20, which included one sole felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Court documents show Smollett faces 16 counts of the same charge.

Smollett, 36, originally claimed he was the victim of a hate crime on Jan. 29 at 2 a.m. when two men accosted him in the Streeterville, an upscale neighborhood of Chicago. Smollett claimed they threw an unidentified chemical liquid on him and twisted a rope around his neck.

Chicago Police investigated the incident as a hate crime against Smollett, who is black and openly gay. Investigators' focus shifted in February when they detained two ""persons of interest"" — Nigerian brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, who said Smollet paid them $3,500 to stage the attack.

According to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, Smollett set up the false attack due to a dissatisfaction with his salary on ""Empire."" After initially faking a letter which also utilized racist and homophobic language in order to draw attention to himself, Smollett hired the Osundairo brothers to assist him in a bigger stunt.

The letter Smollett allegedly sent to himself is currently in FBI custody, where it is being analyzed in a crime lab. No charges have been brought to court in connection with the note so far, though experts have stated that it could result in a separate federal investigation.

Following charges of felony disorderly conduct in February, the ""Empire"" actor was released on a $100,000 bail, which was paid with a $10,000 bond. He was also forced to give up his passport and was ordered to remain under supervision until the adjudication of his case.

The new charges are in conjunction with two separate sets returned by the grand jury, the first set in relation two the number of lies Smollett told during his first interview with law enforcement, and the second in regards to a follow-up interview that took place later that same day, in which he relayed that one of his attackers was white and that the men had come at him from behind and continued to kick him after he fell to the ground.

The two separate sets of charges also align with the two different Chicago police officers that Smollett purportedly lied to.

Mark Geragos, a member of Smollett's defense team and a legal analyst for CNN, stated that the indictment was ""prosecutorial overkill.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines,"" Geragos said of the charges against his client, who has continued to maintain his innocence throughout the ordeal.

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" Geragos added in a statement released to the press.

The actor is currently out of jail pending arraignment Thursday.

In addition to judicial measures brought against Smollett, the actor's ""Empire"" character, Jamal, was written off of the last two episodes of the Fox show's current season in an attempt to ""avoid further disruption on set,"" according to producers.

If convicted, Smollett can receive up to three years in prison, though he is expected to enter a plea deal to avoid incarceration."
