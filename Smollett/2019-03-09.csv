As budget deficit balloons, few in Washington seem to care

WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal budget deficit is ballooning on President Donald Trump's watch and few in Washington seem to care.

And even if they did, the political dynamics that enabled bipartisan deficit-cutting deals decades ago has disappeared, replaced by bitter partisanship and chronic dysfunction.

That's the reality that will greet Trump's latest budget , which will promptly be shelved after landing with a thud on Monday. Like previous spending blueprints, Trump's plan for the 2020 budget year will propose cuts to many domestic programs favoured by lawmakers in both parties but leave alone politically popular retirement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

Washington probably will devote months to wrestling over erasing the last remnants of a failed 2011 budget deal that would otherwise cut core Pentagon operations by $71 billion and domestic agencies and foreign aid by $55 billion. Top lawmakers are pushing for a reprise of three prior deals to use spending cuts or new revenues and prop up additional spending rather than defray deficits that are again approaching $1 trillion.

It's put deficit hawks in a gloomy mood.

For Jussie Smollett, 1 story equals 16 felony counts

CHICAGO (AP) — News that a grand jury had indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren't uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett's comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

""What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,"" said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, called the 16-count indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" But prominent Chicago defence attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it's the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

R. Kelly: 'We're going to straighten all this stuff out'

CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly walked out of a Chicago jail on Saturday after someone who officials say did not want to be publicly identified paid $161,633 that the R&B singer owed in back child support.

Kelly, who was ordered taken into custody on Wednesday by a judge after Kelly said he didn't have the entire amount he owed, briefly spoke with reporters, telling them: ""I promise you, we're going to straighten all this stuff out."" He said that was all he could say, a stark contrast to a nationally televised broadcast that aired earlier in the week in which he cried and ranted about being ""assassinated"" by allegations of sexual abuse that led to criminal charges last month.

Cara Smith, the chief policy officer for the Cook County sheriff's office, which runs the jail, said a person who wished to remain anonymous handed a check on Saturday morning to the county clerk's office for the full amount of Kelly's back child support. A bond slip where people putting up money to secure an inmate's release write their names and relationship to the inmate was left blank, Smith said.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, said he could not discuss the child support payment because of a judge's gag order in that case.

As is done with other high-profile inmates, Kelly, 52, was held in a solo cell under round-the-clock observation.

Pot-litics: 2020 Democrats line up behind legalization

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A growing list of Democratic presidential contenders want the U.S. government to legalize marijuana, reflecting a nationwide shift as more Americans look favourably on cannabis.

Making marijuana legal at the federal level is the ""smart thing to do,"" says California Sen. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor whose home state is the nation's largest legal pot shop. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a prominent legalization advocate on Capitol Hill, says the war on drugs has been a ""war on people.""

Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, who appears poised to join the 2020 Democratic field, has written a book arguing marijuana legalization would hobble drug cartels. In an email to supporters this week, he called again to end the federal prohibition on marijuana.

""Who is going to be the last man — more likely than not a black man — to languish behind bars for possessing or using marijuana when it is legal in some form in more than half of the states in this country?"" O'Rourke wrote.

It's a far different approach from the not-so-distant past, when it was seen as politically damaging to acknowledge smoking pot and no major presidential candidate backed legalization.

Turbulence injures 30 on flight from Istanbul to New York

NEW YORK (AP) — Severe turbulence over the Atlantic Ocean tossed terrified passengers and crew around a Turkish Airlines plane cabin on Saturday, with 30 people suffering bumps, bruises, cuts and a broken leg before the flight landed safely at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, officials said.

Dozens of ambulances lined up in front of a terminal to quickly treat the injured coming off the flight that left Istanbul for the 10-hour trip.

Spokesman Steve Coleman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told The Associated Press that 28 people were taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens after the plane touched down at 5:35 p.m. Two went to Queens Hospital Medical Center. A flight attendant suffered a broken leg, Coleman said.

Turkish Airlines Flight 1 hit the turbulence about 45 minutes before landing at JFK, Coleman said. The crew declared an emergency while the Boeing 777 was still in the air, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

The Port Authority spokesman said other airport operations were not affected.

Trump signed Bibles. Heresy? Many religious leaders say no

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — President Donald Trump was just doing what he could to raise spirits when he signed Bibles at an Alabama church for survivors of a tornado outbreak, many religious leaders say, though some are offended and others say he could have handled it differently.

Hershael York, dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary School of Theology in Louisville, Kentucky, said he didn't have a problem with Trump signing Bibles, like former presidents have, because he was asked and because it was important to the people who were asking.

""Though we don't have a national faith, there is faith in our nation, and so it's not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their Bibles,"" he said. ""Those Bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are, too.""

But the Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, said she was offended by the way Trump scrawled his signature Friday as he autographed Bibles and other things, including hats, and posed for photos. She viewed it, she said, as a ""calculated political move"" by the Republican president to court his evangelical voting base.

Presidents have a long history of signing Bibles, though earlier presidents typically signed them as gifts to send with a spiritual message. President Ronald Reagan signed a Bible that was sent secretly to Iranian officials in 1986. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the family Bible his attorney general used to take the oath of office in 1939.

Wanted: More pastures for West's overpopulated wild horses

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — If you ever wished to gaze at a stomping, snorting, neighing panorama of Western heritage from your living-room window, now could be your chance.

A classic image of the American West — wild horses stampeding across the landscape — not only has endured through the years but has multiplied past the point of range damage. Through May 3, the U.S. government is seeking more private pastures for an overpopulation of wild horses.

Many consider rounding up wild horses to live out their lives on private pastures a reasonable approach to a tricky problem. Wild horses, after all, not only have romantic value, they are protected by federal law.

Just keep in mind a few of the dozens of requirements for getting paid by the government to provide wild horses a home.

""It's not like you can do this in your backyard, or even a 5 acre (2 hectare) plot,"" said Debbie Collins, outreach specialist for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's Wild Horse and Burro Program in Norman, Oklahoma.

More blackouts hit Venezuela as opposition, government rally

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The Venezuelan opposition and government loyalists held rival demonstrations in Caracas on Saturday, as both sides prepared for what some fear could be a protracted power struggle.

The rallies unfolded as power and communications outages continued to hit Venezuela, intensifying the hardship of a country paralyzed by economic and political crisis. The blackouts heightened tension between the bitterly divided factions, which accused each other of being responsible for the collapse of the power grid.

""Hard times are ahead,"" said opposition leader Juan Guaido, who addressed crowds with a loudspeaker after security forces earlier dismantled a speakers' stage that the opposition had erected. He said he planned to tour Venezuela to seek support and lay the groundwork for a massive rally in Caracas.

The 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly said he anticipated more government efforts to sideline and intimidate the opposition. However, President Nicolas Maduro's government has not moved directly against Guaido since he returned to Venezuela from a Latin American tour Monday.

Guaido earlier speculated that Maduro was effectively ignoring him in an attempt to sap the energy of the opposition, whose hopes of ousting the government have so far been stymied.

AP Explains: What Facebook's 'privacy vision' really means

NEW YORK (AP) — Mark Zuckerberg's abrupt Wednesday declaration of a new ""privacy vision "" for social networking was for many people a sort of Rorschach test.

Looked at one way, the manifesto read as an apology of sorts for Facebook's history of privacy transgressions, and suggested that the social network would de-emphasize its huge public social network in favour of private messaging between individuals and among small groups.

Looked at another, it turned Facebook into a kind of privacy champion by embracing encrypted messaging that's shielded from prying eyes — including those of Facebook itself.

Yet another reading suggested the whole thing was a public-relations exercise designed to lull its users while Facebook entrenches its competitive position in messaging and uses it to develop new sources of user data to feed its voracious advertising machine.

As with many things Facebook, the truth lies somewhere in between. Facebook so far isn't elaborating much on Zuckerberg's manifesto. Here's a guide to what we know at the moment about its plans.

Time isn't on your side with coming shift to daylight saving

WASHINGTON (AP) — Time isn't on your side this weekend.

One less hour (of sleep) isn't the end of the world, but you may be a bit sleepier Sunday morning.

Time to abide by the adage to spring forward (though it's not yet spring). The shift from standard to daylight saving time comes at 2 a.m. local time Sunday across most of the United States. Consider setting clocks an hour ahead before bed Saturday night.

Daylight will begin to last longer into the evening but the sun will take an hour longer to emerge in the morning.

No time change is observed in Hawaii, most of Arizona, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas."

1 Separated families: The San Diego federal judge, who ordered that more than 2,700 children be reunited with their parents, expanded his authority last week to potentially thousands more children who were separated at the border earlier during the Trump administration. Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that his authority applies to parents who were separated at the border on or after July 1, 2017. His initial decision applied only to parents whose children were in government custody on June 26, 2018. Sabraw was responding to a report in January by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s internal watchdog that said thousands more children may have been separated since the summer of 2017, which he noted has not been disputed. The department’s inspector general said the precise number is unknown.

2 ‘Prosecutorial overkill’: An attorney for Jussie Smollett says a 16-count indictment against the “Empire” actor is “vindictive” and Smollett “maintains his innocence.” Mark Geragos says in a statement that he did not expect a Cook County grand jury would charge Smollet with 16 separate counts and the indictment is “prosecutorial overkill.” He says the indictment “is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy.” Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for making a false report of an attack on him in Chicago. Police say Smollett staged the attack and recruited two brothers to participate.

3 Ash Wednesday controversy: A teacher in the predominantly Mormon state of Utah was placed on administrative leave after she forced a Catholic student to wash off the Ash Wednesday cross from his forehead. William McLeod, 9, had just returned to school in the city of Bountiful after attending Catholic Mass when his fourth-grade teacher called the ash marking “inappropriate” and gave him a hand wipe to clean it off in front of his classmates. An investigation into whether disciplinary action will be levied against the teacher has been opened, a Davis School District spokesman said.

4 Kelly released: R. Kelly walked out of a Chicago jail Saturday after someone who officials say did not want to be publicly identified paid $161,633 that the R&B singer owed in back child support. Kelly, who was ordered taken into custody Wednesday by a judge after Kelly said he didn’t have the entire amount he owed, briefly spoke with reporters, telling them: “I promise you, we’re going to straighten all this stuff out.” Kelly was charged last month with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse pertaining to four women, including three who were minors when the alleged abuse occurred. He spent a weekend in jail after his arrest and wasn’t freed until a business owner posted his $100,000 bail.

Smollett has been indicted on 16 counts relating to his hate crime hoax.

Some of the fired employees are at a loss to explain why they got the ax.

Chicago Sun-Times:

The worker who spoke to the Sun-Times said she did not know how many workers were involved. The day Smollett was at the hospital, his arrival and the alleged attack were all over the news, the worker said. An employee in another department came to her desk and asked if Smollett been admitted under an alias, the worker said, adding that she didn’t ask why the information was needed because she believed it to be a professional request. A few weeks later, the worker was called to a meeting with her boss and a representative from human resources, the worker said. “They called it a ‘huge breach,’ and I said, ‘If that’s the case, don’t you think it’s a training issue?’” the worker said. Late last month, she was called to another meeting and told she was being fired. “They again said I accessed [Smollett’s] record, and I said I didn’t access his record,” the worker said. She said she had worked at Northwestern for two years and had no previous disciplinary issues.

The hospital is terrified that Smollett will lash out after being caught hoaxing a hate crime and is going to sue everyone — including the Chicago Police Department, which is conducting their own internal investigation into leaks during the course of the investigation.

NBC News:

Chicago police say they are conducting an internal investigation to determine the source of information leaked anonymously to media during the probe into “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett’s claims he was attacked. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the investigation began after Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct last month. Investigators say Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself with two men’s help and made a false police report. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two men hurled slurs and looped a rope around his neck on Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago. Guglielmi says no alleged leakers have been identified so far. He says no officers or staff members with the department have been disciplined for releasing information about the case.

The police have every right to investigate the violation of procedures in the case. Pressure by the local media to get any scrap of information they could no doubt led to hospital employees being as cooperative as they could.

Reporters on the local police beat have their own sources, but it seems pretty clear that the rumors that later proved to be true were not coming from the top, but rather from detectives actually investigating the case. The brass felt it necessary to maintain the fiction of Smollett’s innocence until the last possible moment given the explosive nature of the allegations and the broken relationship between the police and the black community.

The blanket firings at the hospital were excessive. They are probably going to lose more from wrongful termination suits than any amount Smollett would collect if he could prove wrongful access to his records.

With Smollett still maintaining his innocence, his upcoming trial is going to be the biggest media circus in Chicago since the trial of the Chicago 7."

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

“What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,” said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

“It is common practice for the Cook County state’s attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,” he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

“If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you’re done,” said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. “This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.”

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett’s account into each individual pieces and accuse him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett’s contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

“The lies add up pretty fast,” Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police. But Lopez finds that unlikely because all the counts list the same date — Jan. 29.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won’t matter whether it’s on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That’s because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

“If you add them all up it’s still only one crime,” Erickson said. “That’s just how it is.”

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett’s legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed — a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if Smollett did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

“Lying to the FBI is a crime,” said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Geragos, his attorney, said.

A video has surfaced that shows a California man pouring gallons of diesel on his neighbor’s front porch in an attempt to set it on fire and get rid of a ghost. Yes we said ghost!

ABC7 reports that a neighboring family’s security system caught the man pouring diesel and then trying to light the porch on fire, however, the fire never took off.

At the time, a woman and her two young kids were home sleeping during the strange encounter. Luckily,they weren’t hurt.

The family who witnessed it on their security system proceeded to call the police who later came and arrested the man who is believed to live across the street.

“They arrested him,” the homeowner said. “He said that he didn’t have anything against us, that he thought he saw a ghost in our house and to me that’s just even scarier.”

The man has been identified as Cuong Pham, 38, and he will be charged with attempted arson and attempted murder.

CHICAGO — News that a grand jury had indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

This may not be a surprise to some… but it’s definitely interesting to hear the whole roller coaster ride of how Jussie Smollett got to this low-point in his career.

The Empire actor was living the Hollywood life before his name popped up infamously over the alleged vicious hate crime attack in Chicago — according to sources, Smollett had previously been getting various offers in the entertainment business “every other week, if not weekly” before the attack news broke.

Related: Jussie Smollett Indicted On SIXTEEN Felony Counts!

Sources close to Jussie told TMZ today that the star’s career predictably skyrocketed immediately after the violent hate crime was first reported, and Smollett was being hit up for TV gigs, commercials, appearances, and other entertainment work spanning all of Hollywood pretty much every single day.

It makes sense — his name was constantly in the news and, at the time, he was a very sympathetic figure with his alleged attack and hate crime victimization being apparently well-documented and very timely from a political and cultural perspective.

From So Good… To So Bad

But then… the story changed, and Smollett went from being a media darling to somebody who may have allegedly faked his own attack and lied about it to the cops for some kind of personal gain, whether in his career or on some other unknown level.

Accordingly, ever since that time — and especially since his indictment on 16 felony counts — his career prospects have completely dried up. Not only is he reportedly fielding “zero” calls for new work, Smollett is allegedly “being treated like a pariah,” according to sources with knowledge of the situation.

On the most basic level, it makes sense — after all, Hollywood is content to wait out his indictment and legal battle to see what ends up happening to the TV star. Even Empire producers opted to remove him from the final two episodes of this season in order to smooth things over on set and avoid a major distraction on air.

But on the larger, more long-term level, even if he gets off in his legal battle back in Chicago, Smollett may have COMPLETELY damaged his career with this alleged fake attack. To think that he went from TV mainstay, to media darling, to media pariah and effectively a member of some informal Hollywood blacklist in just a few weeks’ time… what a wild and crazy ride.

Of course, America loves a comeback, so who’s to say he couldn’t return to TV at some point in the future and redeem himself?

We’re getting ahead of ourselves. Smollett’s first priority now, ahead even of saving his career, revolves around the legal battle in which he finds himself. Depending on how that ends, we may or may not expect much out of his career going forward.

But first, he needs to keep the focus on those 16 felony counts in the indictment…"

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

“It is common practice for the Cook County state’s attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,” he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

“If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you’re done,” said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. “This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.”

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett’s account into each individual pieces and accuse him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett’s contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

“The lies add up pretty fast,” Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police. But Lopez finds that unlikely because all the counts list the same date — Jan. 29.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won’t matter whether it’s on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That’s because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

“If you add them all up it’s still only one crime,” Erickson said. “That’s just how it is.”

Smollett’s legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Johnson told reporters that police suspect that Smollett sent to Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot a letter threatening the actor. The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation.

But if he did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

“Lying to the FBI is a crime,” said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Geragos, his attorney, said.

Transcript of the segment provided via CNN:

CNN HOST ANDERSON COOPER: So, let’s talk to Jussie Smollett’s defense attorney, Mark Geragos. Mark, thanks very much for being with us. First of all, what is your response to the 16 felony counts that he’s now facing? And is this right that it’s basically one count for each alleged lie that he told?

MARK GERAGOS, JUSSIE SMOLLETT’S DEFENSE ATTORNEY: You know, Anderson, even if he were supposedly the one who orchestrated this, this is an outrage. The fact that he maintains his innocence makes it even more outrageous. 16 counts, I don’t — I think — I defy anybody to find any indictment anywhere where somebody has brought 16 counts for being a victim of a hate crime, basically.

[20:50:10] The problem with this case, and it started with I think almost immediately is —

COOPER: But they’re not bringing 16 counts —

GERAGOS: Hold on for one second, Anderson, because you just put it.

COOPER: OK.

GERAGOS: They’re bringing 16 counts. They’re bringing 16 counts because they parsed out two statements. I defy you to find something like that. He was not suspended. They have not talked to one person at Fox who has said he was dissatisfied with his money. They have not interviewed one person connected with the show “Empire” who says he was dissatisfied with his money.

They have not — they are the ones who started their internal investigation about the leaks because all of the information that was being leaked was false and I wasn’t at Northwestern Hospital. Northwestern Hospital supposedly, if you believe the reporting, let go of 50 people because 50 people have illegally accessed his records.

What is happening here is frankly a media gang bang of this guy of unprecedented proportions and that’s the reason I got into this. I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty.

COOPER: Yes.

GERAGOS: He hasn’t been given one stitch of discovery, not one. There isn’t one police report. Your package just said he paid $3,500. I’ve got the texts, those texts and they conceded that the check and the texts were for training. It wasn’t to pay anything. So, I don’t understand where any of this comes from. He supposedly paid for it. He is the one who supposedly was dissatisfied. There’s no evidence to that.

COOPER: So you’re saying the police — no one from the superintendent had talked about this theory that he wanted more money, he wasn’t happy. You’re saying they haven’t talked to anybody associated with their production at all.

GERAGOS: Right.

COOER: So — but, I mean, does it make sense to you —

GERAGOS: Right. So wouldn’t you expect if a police chief — hold on, Anderson. If a chief police is going to come out and say and give a press conference, and is going to say he was dissatisfied, and is going to basically taint the jury pool, wouldn’t you expect that there would be some basis upon which you would do that?

Wouldn’t you expect one person would have been interviewed who actually knew something about this was negotiating his salary, his agent, somebody on the set, his producer, anybody? Wouldn’t you expect them at the very least?

COOPER: So why — so why did — I mean, if your version of events if, you know, you’re kind of sticking by the version of events that he has probably given, why would these two brothers who, I guess, Smollett knows and was paying for training services or was using as a trainer and there are checks between them or at least a check between them, why did they attack Jussie Smollett using Trump language and a noose and all of these things, which — I mean, there’s — you know, and a liquid. Why are you alleging that they did that?

GERAGOS: I haven’t interviewed them, but I do — I will ask you this, why is it that if they did this and if they were in cahoots and you went in front of a grand jury, why weren’t they indicted, number one. Number two, the police chief is the one who says that they waited until the 47th hour before all of a sudden they were visited and they changed their story and they haven’t been given an immunity, why is that?

And by the way, if these two witnesses were — if they believed these two witnesses, why didn’t they go through the preliminary hearing and put the witnesses on and let them tell their story? There are media requests pending. As soon as the media requested to be able to do the preliminary hearing yesterday, they ran in yesterday and did a grand jury indictment.

As soon as I sent him back to answer questions on an airplane, they didn’t do the grand jury anymore and they filed a criminal complaint. Anybody who is in the criminal justice system, I defy you to find one commentator who hasn’t been caught up in this kind of — this media lynching. Find one legal commentator who tries cases who says I’m familiar with a prosecutor who comes out and gives a closing argument at the bond hearing.

COOPER: But doesn’t it just seem weird to you that you get allegedly attacked by two people who you know and you don’t seem to recognize them even though you claimed you fought back and they ran away and that they — I believe initially there was — I believe Mr. Smollett said one of them was white or they were white. Isn’t it just weird that you get attacked, allegedly attacked by two people you actually know who’ve actually been on “Empire” who you actually worked out with and you don’t recognize them?

[20:55:08] GERAGOS: Yes, yes. And that’s — guess what, I don’t know whether he made that statement or — but what I do know is that when he was told that they had evidence against this two, he refused to sign the complaint because he could not believe it. If he thought they were in on it, wouldn’t he have signed the complaint? Wouldn’t he have sign the complaint? He didn’t believe it.

Now, if you’re asking me what their motivation is, I suppose I could speculate. The motivation of Jussie is not an element of the crime. Their motivation, I’ve got my theories on it but I haven’t seen one piece of evidence and they don’t have one piece of evidence that they’ve turn over that links Jussie to this.

What they do have is a whale of a case as if you believe what the police chief is saying. They’ve got a great case against the two brothers. They’ve got Lyft receipts. They’ve ATM receipts. They’ve got a surveillance video.

By the way, take a look at that surveillance video, tell me if there’s anything that looks peculiar on it to you. I’ll leave that to the investigative journalist. But this is my question, what do they have that corroborates the story? These are the two people who did it. What do they have besides their word that says he was in on this?

COOPER: Man, I don’t know the answer to that question. It does seem odd — I mean, it just seems weird that, you know, a letter is allegedly sent with, you know, pieces cut out from a magazine, which frankly — I mean, as someone who gets hate mail and threatening letters, I’ve — you know, I’ve only seen that in movies. It seems like something someone from, you know, Hollywood would think that’s what a threatening letter looks like. And then he happens to get attacked two weeks later.

GERAGOS: Anderson —

COOPER: I mean, it just — the whole thing doesn’t make much sense, does it?

GERAGOS: Anderson, you’re in Los Angeles today, right?

COOPER: Yes.

GERAGOS: Come down to my office. I’ve got taped up on my wall some of my hate mail where they cut out letters from magazines. So maybe you get a better — you’ve got a more elevated sense of haters. But my haters use that method.

COOPER: OK.

GERAGOS: Number one, they’re taped in my office (INAUDIBLE) you. Number two, by the way, this idea that somehow he had something to do with this and it wasn’t mentioned, the reason for that is, remember, the chief came out. He said that they had something to do with, or either those two, or Jussie had something to do with the letter, that’s a federal investigation. And if I remember correctly, I would ask your reporter to go back and look because the FBI or the Feds, because I think it’s postal inspector pushed back on that idea and said they don’t have any evidence of that and I will tell you he has cooperated with that investigation as well.

COOPER: All right. Mark Geragos, appreciate it. Thank you very much, Mark."

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren't uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett's comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

""What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,"" said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett's contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him.

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett's legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed — a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

Jussie Smollett’s attorney Mark Geragos is heated over the 16 count indictment his client is facing. Geragos has issued a blistering statement calling it a “redundant indictment” and arguing the Empire star maintains his innocence.

RELATED: Jussie Smollett Indicted On 16 Felony Counts By Grand Jury

As we reported, Smollett was originally charged with one Class 4 Felony charge of disorderly conduct last month for falsifying a police report, but a grand jury has applied that charge 15 times over in an 36-page indictment that was returned on Thursday. Now, the actor is facing a maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars and fines of up to $400,000, the Daily News reports.

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.”

Geragos continues,

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.” Geragos said to TMZ.

Geragos also spoke with CNN and said Smollett was the victim of a “media gangbang” and “media lynching.”

Smollett is accused of hiring brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo to beat him up outside his apartment on January 29 in what he later described to police as a racist and homophobic attack. They say Smollett’s motive was that he wanted a higher salary on Empire.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren’t uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett’s comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

“What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,” said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defence attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

“It is common practice for the Cook County state’s attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,” he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

“If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you’re done,” said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. “This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.”

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett’s account into each individual pieces and accuse him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett’s contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

“The lies add up pretty fast,” Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police. But Lopez finds that unlikely because all the counts list the same date — Jan. 29.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won’t matter whether it’s on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That’s because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

“If you add them all up it’s still only one crime,” Erickson said. “That’s just how it is.”

Smollett’s legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Johnson told reporters that police suspect that Smollett sent to Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot a letter threatening the actor. The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation.

But if he did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

“Lying to the FBI is a crime,” said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Geragos, his attorney, said.

CHICAGO - News that a grand jury had indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren't uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett's comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

""What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,"" said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, called the 16-count indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" But prominent Chicago defence attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it's the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren’t uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett’s comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

“What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,” said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defence attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

“It is common practice for the Cook County state’s attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,” he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

“If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you’re done,” said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. “This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.”

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett’s account into each individual pieces and accuse him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett’s contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

“The lies add up pretty fast,” Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police. But Lopez finds that unlikely because all the counts list the same date — Jan. 29.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won’t matter whether it’s on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That’s because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

“If you add them all up it’s still only one crime,” Erickson said. “That’s just how it is.”

Smollett’s legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Johnson told reporters that police suspect that Smollett sent to Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot a letter threatening the actor. The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation.

But if he did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

“Lying to the FBI is a crime,” said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Geragos, his attorney, said.

Police say Smollett -- who gained fame on Fox musical drama ""Empire"" -- staged the attack in a bid to gain publicity and a bigger paycheck.



Instead, the 36-year-old actor has been dropped from the last two episodes of the show's current season, and his future is now in the hands of the court.



Smollett was charged last month with one felony count of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.



He allegedly sent himself a threatening letter and then hired two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.



According to court documents published online by local media, the 16-count indictment lists the specific statutes Smollett violated by telling police he had been attacked when he knew ""there was no reasonable ground for believing"" that such crimes had occurred.



Smollett has denied the allegations against him and in a statement to the media, his attorney Mark Geragos decried what he called ""prosecutorial overkill.""



""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" Geragos said.



The case has drawn intense national interest with everyone from politicians to celebrities and late night talk show hosts commenting.



When asked about the indictment, a Fox spokesman declined to comment.



Smollett was released on bond in February. He is next due back in court on March 14. — AFP

The “Empire” set has been left deeply divided by the Jussie Smollett scandal, we’re told, between people who continue to support the embattled actor despite his arrest, and people who are furious with him.

Sources say the cast has been broadly more supportive of him, while the crew has been broadly more critical.

The schism on the Chicago set was brought to the fore in recent days, we’re told, when a well-wishes card was passed around for Smollett, who was charged on Feb. 20 for allegedly staging a hoax hate crime against himself.

We’re told some people signed the card, but many refused.

“Some of the cast wanted to send him a message, like a ‘We’re thinking of you’ thing, and asked people to sign it,” said a source, “but a lot of people were disgusted. The hair and makeup people, a lot of the crew.”

As Page Six reported, Smollett returned to work on the Fox show just hours after posting bail on Feb. 21.

Despite the fact that the Chicago Police Department gave a news conference detailing ­exactly how they believe Smollett put the scheme together, he still has supporters.

On Tuesday, Queen Latifah — who has appeared on “Empire” — told Yahoo of Smollett, “The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet,” adding, “So until I can see some definitive proof — which I haven’t seen yet — then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.”

Apparently, people on the set feel similarly.

On Feb. 20, Smollett was charged with filing a false police report related to the Jan. 29 incident. On Friday, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 further felony counts of disorderly conduct. He’s currently free on $100,000 bail.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offence had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment."

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett's legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed - a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if Smollett did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

""Lying to the FBI is a crime,"" said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

Smollett was indicted by a grand jury on charges related to the January incident, in which he claimed he was attacked by two men saying racist and homophobic slurs as they beat him and placed a noose around his neck. But as Chicago police investigated, they found inconsistencies and ultimately charged Smollett with paying two friends to carry out the attack.

After the charges were laid on Friday, Smollett’s lawyer called it overkill and noted that the actor still maintains his innocence.

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination,” attorney Mark Geragos said in a statement to People magazine. “What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.”

Geragos went on to call the indictment “redundant and vindictive” and claimed that it was just an attempt to make headlines on the part of prosecutors. He also claimed that Chicago police tampered with Jussie Smollett’s medical records.

Chicago police initially investigated the attack as a potential hate crime, but later found surveillance video of two Nigerian brothers — Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo — in the vicinity of the attack. Investigators later found that Smollett had paid the brothers with a personal check, and video showed them buying the supplies that had been used in the attack.

The openly gay actor has faced considerable pushback after police said he faked the attack, with many who had initially backed Smollett apologizing and laying blame on him. TMZ reported that the allegations have also damaged his career, with job offers drying up since he was charged. There have also been reports that he could be fired from Empire, though the show’s producers have said they are investigating before making a decision.

Jussie Smollett could face some very harsh consequences for the allegedly fake attack. As The Source noted, all 16 of the felony counts face a maximum of three years in prison, so he could technically face more than 50 years in prison if he were convicted on all counts and if a judge ordered them to be served consecutively — though legal experts said that would be a most unlikely outcome. He likely faces a maximum of three years behind bars."

Jussie Smollett

The 'Empire' star was accused of the felony crime after he alleged he was the victim of a homophobic and racist hate attack on January 29, and was indicted with the charges on Friday (08.03.19), following allegations that the attack was a hoax.

But his lawyer Mark Geragos has slammed the ruling as ""prosecutorial overkill"", and insists his client is ""adamantly"" maintaining his innocence ahead of the case going to trial.

In a statement to People magazine, he said: ""The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.

Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.""

Of the 16 new counts, eight charges involve false statements given to Officer Muhammed Baig, while the other eight are for a more detailed account given to Detective Kim Murray.

Jussie had told police he was assaulted at 2am by two men who shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him and put a noose around his neck. In the more detailed account, he claimed that he fought back, and that one of the attackers was white.

The indictment read: ""Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission there was no reasonable ground for believing that such an offense had been committed."""

Moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper, the Daily Show team talked about how they report — and skewer — the news in a time when there is no news cycle, and also gave details on their strategy for the upcoming 2020 election.

Noah pointed out the news programs he watched in South Africa gave straight facts. But when he came to America, he saw that the cable news channels would have tons of panels and commentators giving their opinion on the news. With The Daily Show‘s forthcoming coverage of the 2020 election, Noah wants to give an accurate “journey and story” of what is going on in the country.

“It’s not about eating a corn dog, but how you are going to treat people who eat too many corn dogs,” joked Noah.

Tapper responded, “But the corn dog is the most important part,” to which Noah agreed.

“I strive to create a show every day that informs you,” Noah added.

Noah and The Daily Show team will go back on the road for the upcoming election, tracking the candidates and attending all the conventions. He says that he wants to “focus on policy” and give an “accurate representation of what is happening in the race and what the candidates stand for and how it affects the country.” He said, “It’s easy to get caught up in the things that offend people, but not the things that affect people.” Because of this, he wants to “recalibrate” the telling of the story of America.

“America will have to decide who it is,” he said. “What is going to be interesting is this new narrative around the Democratic party. For a long time it has been about Trump.” He adds that The Daily Show is going to take a look at their plans and how they cope with each other. He poses the question, “Will they destroy each other or put a defense against Donald Trump?”

Of course, Trump came up in the conversation. Noah said that he has been sucking the life out of the news cycle — or at least what’s left of it.

“What we have come to realize is there is no news cycle — there is no plan,” said Noah in regards to how things have been since Trump has taken office. “When we started, the news cycle used to have a cadence to it. Now, there’s something called ‘the 5:30’ curse.” He said that around that time, someone is always getting indicted, a tweet, someone is getting fired – something is going to happen.

They have since learned to embrace the curse and at 5:30 pm, they sometimes throw out what they have planned and write stories that reflect the most up-to-date news. This has been done with many field pieces and sketches with one of most recent ones being the Jussie Smollett case with Young-White and Wood.

Sloan has covered the infamous “Permit Patty” who reported a young girl selling bottled water, while Chieng infiltrated a biker gang. Kosta also did a field piece on Switzerland’s gun laws and Lydic keeps a pulse on Trump’s Twitter account in a segment appropriately called “Masterpiece Tweeter.” Speaking of, The Daily Show brought the Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library exhibition to SXSW for everyone to bathe in the glory of 45’s best tweets. As Wood points out, “The more divisive the issue, the more engagement.”

“We want to be part of the story,” said Noah. “I enjoy creating a show with my friends and colleagues that is edgy — we make jokes that piss people off or rattle the cage.” At the same, it engages audiences and hits on timely topics…while giving a few laughs.

“If you’re not laughing at what’s going on right now, you’ll go crazy!” Noah exclaims."

""What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,"" said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos called the 16-count indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" But prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it's the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

""It is common practice for the Cook County state's attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,"" he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

""If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you're done,"" said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. ""This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.""

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett's account into each individual pieces and accuse him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett's contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

""The lies add up pretty fast,"" Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won't matter whether it's on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That's because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

""If you add them all up it's still only one crime,"" Erickson said. ""That's just how it is.""

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett's legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed - a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if Smollett did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

""Lying to the FBI is a crime,"" said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" Geragos, his attorney, said.

CHICAGO -- News that a grand jury had indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday.

Mark Geragos, an attorney for the Empire star, released a statement to PEOPLE, on behalf of the actor:

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination,” Geragos said. He continued, “What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.”

The actor was charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct after allegedly filing false police reports. Geragos went on to imply that the charges were simply a “desperate attempt” from the Chicago police department reports the Associated Press.

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records.”

The lawyer added that Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” Attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a statement given to PEOPLE on Wednesday. “Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

As for Jussie’s 16 counts, the total is a result of the grand jury counting each part of Smollett’s report of an allegedly false hate crime separately."

According to TMZ, a source said the Empire actor was fielding offers almost weekly and now, the phone has stopped ringing.

Smollett, who claimed he was assaulted by two racist and homophobic attackers in January, was reportedly being offered countless opportunities following the alleged attack. Sources say he was getting offers for movies, television shows, commercials, interviews and appearances.

But once he was arrested and charged with a felony for filing a false police report, everything dried up.

To add insult to injury, many of his Empire co-stars withdrew their support. The Empire creators also removed Smollett’s character from the final two episodes of the season in order to keep peace on the set.

Smollett is expected to be arraigned on March 14. His lawyer is calling the indictment “overkill.”

“We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination,” Mark Geragos told USA Today. “What is unexpected however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.

CHICAGO -- A grand jury's 16-count indictment announced Friday against Jussie Smollett might be the result of prosecutors looking to charge the ""Empire"" actor for individual lies they contend he told about the night he says he was attacked by two masked men.

The reasons are not explained in the indictment, but legal experts say prosecutors sought indictments on individual details Smollett provided police after he reported being the victim of a racially charged and homophobic attack. Former state appellate judge David Erickson says prosecutors might be trying to protect their case in the event a jury or judge doesn't believe all of the allegations.

Prominent Chicago attorney Terry Sullivan says the 16 counts may be a signal of just how angry prosecutors and police are at Smollett.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

“It is common practice for the Cook County state’s attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,” he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

“If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you’re done,” said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. “This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.”

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett’s account into each of its individual pieces and accused him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett’s contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

“The lies add up pretty fast,” Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won’t matter whether it’s on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That’s because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

“If you add them all up it’s still only one crime,” Erickson said. “That’s just how it is.”

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett’s legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed — a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if Smollett did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

“Lying to the FBI is a crime,” said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Geragos, his attorney, said.

CHICAGO (AP) — News that a grand jury had indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren’t uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett’s comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

“What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,” said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

The “Empire” star was accused of the felony crime after he alleged he was the victim of a homophobic and racist hate attack on Jan. 29, 2019, and indicted with the charges on Friday, March 8, following allegations that the attack was a hoax.

But Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence,” according to his lawyer Mark Geragos, who has slammed the ruling as “prosecutorial overkill.”

In a statement to People magazine, Geragos said: “The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Of the 16 new counts, eight charges involve false statements given to Officer Muhammed Baig, while the other eight are for a more detailed account given to Detective Kim Murray.

Smollett had told police he was assaulted at 2 a.m. by two men who shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him and put a noose around his neck. In the more detailed account, he claimed that he fought back and that one of the attackers were White.

The indictment read: “Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission there was no reasonable ground for believing that such an offense had been committed.”"

A Chicago grand jury has indicted Empire star Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

In January, Smollett reported that he was the victim of an attack that police initially investigated as a hate crime. Later, two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, reportedly told police that they’d been paid $3,000 by Smollett for orchestrating the attack. Police claim that Smollett staged the attack and a threatening letter that arrived one week beforehand in order to “gain attention” because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.” Smollett vehemently denies any part in staging the attack.

Though he was originally indicted on just one count of disorderly conduct, on March 7 the grand jury returned 16 felony counts, one for each lie Smollett allegedly told police, according to ABC7 Chicago:

“ The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him. The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.”

In a statement, Smollett’s attorney Mark Geragos called the number of felony indictments “overkill”:

“The fact of an indictment is not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.

""What is happening here is, frankly, a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions,"" Geragos claimed. ""That's the reason I got into this. I've never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case has. It's startling the way people assume he's guilty.""

Geragos also took issue with the indictment itself, which included one charge of disorderly conduct for each of Smollett's eight alleged lies to two separate police officers.

""I defy anybody to find any indictment anywhere where somebody has brought 16 counts for being a victim of a hate crime,"" Geragos said.

For his part, Cooper did not buy much of what Geragos was selling, noting how ""weird"" Smollett's story is — if true at all.

Many of the employees of Northwestern Memorial Hospital say they are innocent of any wrongdoing, WBBM reported, citing anonymous sources and employees from the hospital.

According to sources who spoke to the station, 60 or more employees lost their jobs over the incident, although the hospital has not confirmed that.

Smollett was treated in the emergency room of Northwestern on Jan. 29, the day he claimed he was assaulted by two men while walking in a Chicago neighborhood around 2:00 a.m. The actor claimed that in addition to racial and homophobic insults, he was beaten, a rope was put around his neck and a chemical was poured over him.

After a police investigation into the alleged incident, Smollett was charged with filing a false police report after staging the attack. On Thursday, he was indicted on 16 felony counts.

WBBM quoted former hospital employees who said they were fired even though they had never accessed Smollett’s records.

Others said they did have legitimate access to the records but were still terminated.

“It’s devastating. It’s humiliating,” one fired employee said. “I had told them on several occasions that I did not enter the records and I didn’t understand how having those names on the screen is my entering the records.”

However, WMAQ, another Chicago station, quoted one employee who admitted accessing the records out of “morbid curiosity.” The former employee’s name was withheld.

The Chicago Sun-Times quoted an unnamed administrator who said she was fired for discussing with a co-worker whether Smollett had been admitted under an assumed name.

The hospital has declined to comment about the firings, saying it’s an issue involving personnel as well as HIPAA regulations.

Attorney Erin Jackson, who does not represent the hospital, said that if records have been wrongfully accessed, it gets complicated quickly.

“At some point they’ll have to report the breach to the Department of Health and Human Services, and at some point they also need to tell Jussie that his records were accessed in an unauthorized way,” she told WBBM.

Jackson said HIPAA laws are very clear.

“HIPAA has a requirement that people only have access to the minimum necessary information to do their jobs, so if they’re not involved in treating him, they shouldn’t have access to even his name,” she said. “The consequences are grave. We’re talking about huge fines, potentially criminal liability.”

She said hospitals need to enforce a zero-tolerance policy for breaches.

“Part of being a great medical center is being able to protect your patients’ privacy, and if you can’t do that, you’re going to lose the trust of patients,” she said.

The hospital’s policy for violations of patients is spelled out in a document WBBM said it obtained.

“Level 3 violations, which include intentionally accessing a patient’s record for which he/she has no business purpose to do so are punishable by termination or legal action,” the station said, quoting the policy.

More to the point, I think, is the possibility that Smollett might lose the battle in federal court but win the war in the court of public opinion. The seeming duplications showing up in the disorderly conduct charges are making this look like more of a dogpile than any message about not tolerating hate crime hoaxes, and the actor probably knows that will play in his favor at work and among his fans. (NBC News)

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett has been indicted by a grand jury in Chicago on 16 felony counts after allegedly lying to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime. Smollett was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct for the allegedly false report he made with Chicago police on Jan. 29, according to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. In it he claimed he was assaulted by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs.

Look, I’m not here to say that Smollett shouldn’t be held accountable and pay the price for such an offensive, damaging stunt if he’s convicted. (He’s still maintaining his innocence as of this weekend.) He’s managed to alienate nearly everyone at this point, aside from a few of his friends and some of the most hard-core social justice warriors who are constructing conspiracy theories as we speak. Most of the more conservative observers are sick of seeing fake hate crimes (of which there are many), while liberal activists note the potential damage to victims of actual biased violence (of which there are far too many) when they go to report the crimes. (See note on “hate crimes” at the bottom of this article.)

With that said, having the prosecutors pile this many federal charges on Smollett over the incident will likely play right into his hands. Those sixteen charges are broken down into what appear to be eight individual statements made to two different law enforcement agents investigating the incident. In reality, it was the same allegedly BS story being told twice in official complaints. What originally looked to be either a misdemeanor offense of disorderly conduct under Illinois law or, at most, a felony of the lowest level, could now add up to serious jail time.

Even if you think that’s a justifiable outcome, it only feeds grist to the social justice mill. What will be said of Smollet – rightly or wrongly – is that anyone who was white, straight, “cisgender” or female would have gotten a much lighter charge. And when it comes to falsely reporting crimes, there are plenty of cases to draw upon. What about Mattress Girl or “Jackie” from the Rolling Stone, Rape on Campus debacle? They were both accusing men of crimes equally as heinous as what Smollett claimed, if not more so. Has either of them faced so much as a day in court?

You can see how this might play out in the actor’s favor whether he winds up spending any time behind bars or not. Smollett’s attorney is already calling the list of indictments “vindictive.” Having watched a number of these passion plays being aired out in the court of public opinion, it’s fairly easy to see where this train heads next. The liberals who were forced to abandon Smollett once the truth appeared to come out will now be able to say, “well, yeah. What he did was bad. But the overboard persecution of a young gay man of color that followed overshadowed the original sin.” And just like that, he’s got his job back on the Empire cast.

I can’t wait for the Netflix original documentary on The Framing and Redemption of Jussie Smollett.

SIDE NOTE: (Jazz) While I’ve covered this subject countless times here over the years, it bears pointing out again. I do not believe in so-called “hate crimes” and still believe all of them should be stricken from the books. They are thought crimes, bringing extra punishment and allocation of law enforcement resources for actions that are already illegal based on nothing more than the perpetrator’s beliefs or speech, which remain protected even if they are generally despised in our society. But for the purposes of this article, it would quickly become unwieldy to try to discuss the current situation without the “hate crime” label, so I used it here."

Capitol Hill and Silicon Valley have locked their sights on the next targets of a frightening free speech-squelching purge: independent citizens who dare to raise questions online about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

I’m vaccinated. My children are up to date. There’s no dispute that vaccines have saved untold lives. But over the years, I’ve voiced my concerns about vaccine claims and government coercion in my newspaper columns and blog posts. These concerns include my objections to Gardasil mandates for schoolchildren in Texas and California; schools’ threatening parents with jail time for refusing chickenpox shots for their kids; ineffectiveness of the flu vaccine; contamination issues at vaccine plants abroad; lack of data on vaccines’ long-term and synergistic effects on children; and pharma-funded politicians’ financial conflicts of interest.

In 2004, I recounted my family’s firsthand experience with bully doctors who balked at even the mildest questioning of the wisdom of the newborn hepatitis B immunization. When my husband and I asked if we could simply delay this particular shot, as the vaccine is for a virus that is contracted mostly through intravenous drug use and sexual contact, my son’s pediatrician angrily kicked us out of her practice.

Does this informed skepticism make me and other like-minded parents public health menaces, as the World Health Organization has proclaimed? Are we “sociopaths,” as a journalist at The Atlantic once sneered? Apparently so.

At a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Washington state’s public health secretary, John Wiesman, demanded that the feds launch a national campaign to counter “anti-vaccine” groups that are spreading what he condemned as “false information.” Weisman called for increased funding from the Centers for Disease Control to combat opponents of the state’s push to prevent parents from opting their children out of immunizations for personal or philosophical reasons. Health officials have blamed vaccine critics’ social media influence for recent measles outbreaks. So Wiesman further urged Twitter, Facebook and Google to “use whatever mechanism they have available to stop promoting pseudoscience.”

Let’s be clear: Misinformation of all kinds abounds on the internet. The world’s most influential “mainstream” media websites and celebrity social media accounts, for example, recklessly fanned the flames of the recent Covington Catholic High School and Jussie Smollett hate crime hoaxes. No one in Washington has called for the boycott of The Washington Post or TMZ over their false and misleading stories. But for some reason (hint: pharmaceutical big business), politicians and government bureaucrats are now hell-bent on deplatforming any and all dissenters who challenge mandatory vaccine regimens.

Under pressure from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Amazon pulled the documentaries “Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,” “Man Made Epidemic” and “Shoot ’em Up: The Truth About Vaccines” from its Prime Video streaming service. Last week, Google-owned YouTube moved to demonetize “anti-vaccine” channels, tweak algorithms to suppress vaccine “conspiracy” videos and combat “vaccine hesitancy.” Pinterest blocks users from using the search terms “vaccine,” “vaccinations” and “anti-vax,” no matter the quality of the results. Facebook plans to downgrade vaccine skeptics’ content on newsfeeds, recommended user groups and ads.

Is there junk science on the “anti-vaccine” side? Sure. But you can’t address this issue without also addressing the problem with physicians and public health flacks who are unwilling to discuss the full risks of vaccines as well as their benefits; pro-vaccination groups that provide incorrect information about vaccines’ duration of protection; physicians who refuse to care for children who are not “fully” vaccinated; and the comparative risk-benefit ratios of different vaccines.

As for efficacy, consider this new data: A recent whooping cough outbreak at the private Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles last week resulted in 30 students contracting the illness, all of whom were vaccinated. Of 18 unvaccinated students, none caught the disease. Will pointing this out on my Facebook and Twitter accounts bring down the Silicon Valley ban hammer?

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who happens to be a physician and parent himself, was the lone voice of dissent at the Senate hearing this week. While acknowledging that the benefits of vaccines generally outweigh their risks, he noted the plain truth that “it is wrong to say there are no risks to vaccines.” He added that over $4 billion has been paid by the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for adults and children who have been injured or died as a result of receiving federally recommended childhood vaccines.

Is it unacceptable fearmongering to raise that point? How about to share information on vaccine manufacturers’ astonishing exemption from product liability? Or to point parents to new research findings on brain injuries caused by vaccines, which can be found at VaccinePapers.org? Or to link them to a recent statement by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which “strongly opposes federal interference in medical decisions, including mandated vaccines.”

When it comes to protecting our children, skepticism is always the best medicine. We need more free speech, not less. Those who seek to suppress debate and discussion in the name of the “public good” are the true health threats.

Smollett will appear in court on March 14 where he will enter a plea and a judge will be assigned to the case.

Said Geragos: “This is an outrage….I defy anybody to find any indictment anywhere where somebody has brought 16 counts for being a victim of a hate crime, basically.”

“They have not talked to one person at Fox who has said he was dissatisfied with his money,” Geragos continued. “They have not interviewed one person connected with the show Empire who says he was dissatisfied with his money. They are the ones who started their internal investigation about the leaks because all of the information that was being leaked was false.”

Added Geragos: “What is happening here is frankly a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions. And that’s the reason I got into this. I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty. He hasn’t been given one stitch of discovery. There isn’t one police report. Your package just said he paid $3,500. I’ve got the texts. Those texts––and they conceded that the check and the texts were for training. It wasn’t to pay anything! So I don’t understand where any of this comes from.”

Anderson then asked why the brothers would do such a thing: “Doesn’t it just seem weird to you that you get allegedly attacked by two people who you know and you don’t seem to recognize them, even you claimed you fought back and they ran away, and — I believe initially Mr. Smollett said one of them was white, or they were white — Isn’t it just weird that you get allegedly attacked by two people you actually know that have been on Empire that, who you have actually worked out with, and you don’t recognize them?”

“Yes,” replied Geragos. “I don’t know whether he made that statement but what I do know is that when he was told that they had evidence against these two he refused to sign the complaint because he could not believe it.”

Added Geragos: “I haven’t seen one piece of evidence and they don’t have one piece of evidence that they’ve turned over that links Jussie to this. What they do have is a great case against the two brothers….What do they have besides their word that he is in on this.”"

(CBS NEWS) – A Chicago grand jury charged actor Jussie Smollett with 16 felony counts for falsely reporting a hate crime.

Smollett was charged last month with a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly making up the hate crime. Smollett has insisted he is innocent.

The grand jury returned the indictment on Thursday, CBS Chicago reported.Each one of the charges carries a maximum count of four years in prison, meaning he could face 64 years in total.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and openly gay, plays Jamal Lyon on Fox’s hit TV show, “Empire,” a drama that chronicles a family-run record label. He told police he was attacked by two masked men when he was returning home from a Subway sandwich store Jan. 29 around 2 a.m.

Smollett claimed the two men had beat him, said homophobic and racial slurs and put a noose around his neck before fleeing. He said he heard, “this is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Trump’s campaign slogan.

It’s equivalent to how public figures probably feel when some Twitter troll says they can’t play baseball or that they never should have been cast in a particular film. The average person doesn’t know much about their industry, and so it’s grating for them to have very strong (sometimes outright unkind) opinions on things they know so little about. It’s similar for people who work in and around politics (or even simply immerse themselves in the subject to write intelligently about it). Celebrity opinions trashing this politician or that policy idea can be equally frustrating.

So when a celebrity actually makes an attempt to learn something about politics — particularly if that celebrity is known to express political opinions, and even more so when that celebrity reaches across the partisan aisle and attempts to gather information he may not agree with — it’s a fairly special occasion.

That’s exactly what Chris Evans, Captain America himself, tried to do Friday evening by visiting several lawmakers, from both sides of the aisle, on The Hill in Washington, D.C.

Evans has been known to use his Twitter feed to discuss politics, and generally tends to run afoul of conservatives’ policy ideas. He’s even been known to poke the bear in the White House without shame.

The “Avengers” actor has been outspoken about politics on his Twitter account, and has confronted former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke in his timeline. Evans talked to Esquire about why he chooses to be so openly political and his thoughts on President Trump’s election. “I feel rage,” he told the magazine of his reaction to the new administration. “I feel fury. It’s unbelievable. People were just so desperate to hear someone say that someone is to blame. They were just so happy to hear that someone was angry. Hear someone say that Washington sucks. They just want something new without actually understanding. I mean, guys like Steve Bannon — Steve Bannon! — this man has no place in politics.”

And Evans has certainly come to the attention of conservatives for being a bit too woke for his own good.

Actually we called our country a melting pot. It means that we took the best parts of world cultures and made them our own, we didn’t invite people to come here and identify as separated or hyphenated Americans. We are supposed to be E Pluribus Unum, no E Pluribus Pluribus! https://t.co/S2kgtHDkf8 — Chris Loesch (@ChrisLoesch) September 11, 2018

But you have to give the guy credit. He may not come away from a meeting with Sen. Tim Scott agreeing on the right approach to tackling poverty in America, but at least he’ll be making more of an educated decision going forward (and I’d be willing to bet his opinions soften quite a bit regarding conservative policy. That tends to happen when you learn the “whys” of things).

It’s a whole lot more than the Kathy Griffins or Jimmy Kimmels of the world are willing to do. And it’s commendable."

The ‘Empire’ star was arrested last month (Feb 2019) on one count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, claiming he had been attacked by two individuals outside his apartment in Chicago, Illinois on January 29 – and now his legal problems have doubled with the indictments.

A grand jury multiplied the number of charges against Smollett on Thursday, increasing the total to 16.

The jury members reportedly tallied up the citations for each lie he allegedly told in the initial police report he submitted and the subsequent interview with cops about the attack, which law enforcement officers now insist was a hoax.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time… there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” the latest indictment document obtained by CBS 2 Chicago reads.

Just one of the felony charges carries a three-year sentence behind bars if Smollett is convicted, which means the 36-year-old could potentially spend decades in jail. Smollett is set to be arraigned on March 14, 2019.

Jussie told police two white men yelling homophobic and racist slurs assaulted him as he made on his way home from a sandwich shop in the middle of the night, but law enforcement officials claim the star paid two Nigerian brothers he knew from his work on the Empire set $3,500 to attack him – allegations the actor has strenuously denied."

On Friday, the State of Illinois hit suspended Empire star Smollett with 16 class 4 felony counts of disorderly conduct pertaining to allegations he filed a false police report after conspiring to orchestrate a hate crime hoax against himself for publicity purposes.

The 16 counts are based on each alleged falsehood Smollett relayed to the police officers who initially responded to his call and the detectives assigned later.

Smollett, who is gay and black, told police he was attacked at 2:00 a.m. on January 29 by two white men who poured bleach on his black skin, wrapped a noose around his neck, assaulted him, and spewed racist and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s alleged attackers were also fans of Donald Trump who went so far as to inform Smollett that “This is MAGA country!” — a reference to the president’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Police, however, say it never happened, that it was all staged by Smollett. Authorities claim the two attackers, who are black, have confessed to their role in the hoax after Smollett paid them $3,500 to stage the incident.

Apparently, Smollett believed the incident would result in a raise from Empire producers.

According to various news reports, based on these state charges alone, if convicted on all counts, the 36-year-old could face up to 48 years in prison (one to three years for each count). A consecutive sentence for the same crime, however, is unlikely. Smollett is probably facing one to three years or probation.

He will be arraigned on March 14.

In worse news for Smollett, there is still the matter of the hate mail authorities say the actor mailed to himself. Included in the letter was a white powder later found to be harmless.

If it can be proved he deliberately used the mail to commit a fraudulent act, that is a federal crime that could mean up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Smollett continues to claim he is innocent of all charges. Apparently, he wants us to believe two friends of his waited around in the middle of the night in subzero Chicago weather for an opportunity to commit a hate crime against him while posing as Trump supporters.

Obviously, what Smollett is accused of is beyond appalling, especially after we learned he staged this hoping it would be picked up by surveillance video. The social ramifications of that video getting out, of a hate-outlet like CNN relentlessly rerunning video of a black man being assaulted by two guys in red hats, could have been ten time worse than what we saw in Ferguson, Missouri — which was also the result of a media-fabricated hoax (led largely by the far-left CNN).

Smollett doesn’t deserve 48 years in prison, but for his own aggrandizement, Smollett played with fire, with the well-being of an entire city. If found guilty, he must be punished, meaning at least some prison time.

At least for right now, it looks as though Smollett is prepared to go to trial. It might be bluster in the hopes the state will offer a sweeter plea deal to save the time, expense, and insane publicity of what would be a costly trial, but the authorities are not hiding their disgust with Smollett, so they might welcome a trial, welcome the opportunity to lay out their case.

“You know, Anderson, even if [Smollett] were supposedly the one who had orchestrated this, this is an outrage. The fact that he maintains his innocence makes it more outrageous,” Geragos told Anderson Cooper.

“16 counts? I defy anybody to find any indictment, anywhere, where somebody has brought 16 counts for being a victim of a–of a hate crime, basically.”

The attorney also said that the media has swung so far against Smollett that it’s “startling.”

“What is happening here is frankly, a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions. That’s the reason I got into this,” he said. “I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously, and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case.

Geragos also said Friday that the charges against him are “vindictive.”

The 16-county grand jury indictment of Empire actor Jussie Smollett relates to allegations that he lied to police about a reported attack in January — eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker’s eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack.

LONDON - Jussie Smollett “maintains his innocence” after being indicted with 16 counts of filing a false police report.

The Empire star was accused of the felony crime after he alleged he was the victim of a homophobic and racist hate attack on 29 January and was indicted with the charges on Friday, following allegations that the attack was a hoax.

But his lawyer Mark Geragos has slammed the ruling as “prosecutorial overkill”, and insists his client is “adamantly” maintaining his innocence ahead of the case going to trial.

In a statement to People magazine, he said: “The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Smollett.

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Smollett’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Smollett adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Of the 16 new counts, eight charges involve false statements given to Officer Muhammed Baig, while the other eight are for a more detailed account given to Detective Kim Murray.

Smollett had told police he was assaulted at 2am by two men who shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him and put a noose around his neck. In the more detailed account, he claimed that he fought back, and that one of the attackers was white.

The indictment read: “Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission there was no reasonable ground for believing that such an offence had been committed.”"

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment."

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, publicly insisted that the latest developments are little more than “prosecutorial overkill” and an attempt by the Chicago Police Department to cover up their own misdeeds.

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected,” Geragos told TMZ. “We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.

Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Geragos was referring to the records at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where Smollett was treated following the attack, and where dozens of employees were let go for allegedly accessing his medical records without permission. Chicago Police Sergeant Rocco Alioto has confirmed an open investigation into department leaks surrounding the initial details of Smollett’s attack.

In a later appearance on CNN Friday night, Geragos told Anderson Cooper that “What is happening here is, frankly, a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions.” He added that he had “never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case has. It’s startling the way people assume he’s guilty.”

On Friday, Smollett was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct by a Cook County grand jury, with each charge potentially carrying up to four years in prison. Sources at ABC Eyewitness News have suggested the disgraced Empire star will likely avoid jail time with a plea deal, despite his initial “not guilty” plea after turning himself in.

For his part, Smollett was written out of the final two episodes of the current season of Empire, and may be recast in a future season. TMZ also reports that Smollett was “getting hit up nonstop for movies, TV gigs, commercials . . . interviews and appearances” after the alleged attack, but is now “being treated like a pariah” by the industry.

The F.B.I. is also looking into a threatening letter filled with white powder that Smollett received on the set of his Fox series. If he is found to be responsible for the letter, Smollett may face federal charges."

After being indicted on 16 felony counts for allegedly filing a false police report, Jussie Smollett is “adamantly maintaining his innocence.” The “Empire” actor claimed to have been assaulted by two men who shouted homophobic and racial slurs at him in late January, sticking to his story even as it was met with increasing suspicion in the following weeks. Chicago police eventually arrested him and said he had “staged” the attack in order to receive a higher salary and “promote his career.”

Smollett’s attorney released the following statement after the actor was indicted yesterday:

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Following Smollett’s arrest, Fox announced that his character would not appear in the remaining episodes of the show’s fifth season; reports have since emerged that he may be replaced altogether by a new actor, and co-creator Lee Daniels (on whom Smollett’s character of Jamal is loosely based) was “said to be a strong proponent of the recast option” as of late February.

CHICAGO (AP) — A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment."

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records,” Geragos said in a statement reported by TheWrap.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” he added.

While discussing the charges against Smollett with ""Access"" in an interview released Friday, Geragos said court proceedings were going as he expected.

“This is not a newsflash. I expected it,” he said.

Smollett told police that he was the victim of a vicious January attack in which he claimed that two men tied a rope around his neck while shouting racist and homophobic slurs as well as pro-Trump language at him.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said last month that Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to fake an attack against him “because he was dissatisfied with his salary.”

“The specific allegations–“false report of offense”– are Class 4 felonies,” CBS Chicago reports. “The indictment expands the case against the actor. The counts focus on allegedly false statements he made to two different Chicago Police officers. Each count covers various alleged acts that Smollett falsely described to the officers–including that he was hit by two men, that they yelled racial and homophobic slurs and poured a chemical on him.”

“A conviction on any count could lead to a sentence ranging from probation to up to three years in prison,” the Chicago Tribune reports.

The Tribune adds: ‘Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, has said he was walking from a Subway sandwich shop to his apartment in the 300 block of East North Water Street around 2 a.m. Jan. 29 when two men walked up, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him and wrapped a noose around his neck. Smollett said they also yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan of “Make America Great Again.”’

Watch a report from CBS Chicago on the indictments:

At a press conference on February 21, Chicago Police Chief Eddie Johnson reported that Smollett had turned himself in after testimony from two brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, who said that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack.

Speaking of the hoax attack, Johnson said, “‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Johnson said “This stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary, so he concocted a story about being attacked.”

Said Johnson: “I’m left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?”

Added Johnson: “Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim who’s in need of support by police and investigators.”

“I’m also concerned about what this means moving forward for hate crimes,” said Johnson. “My concern is that hate crimes will now publicly be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn’t happen.”"

Back in January, Jussie made headlines when he was reportedly assaulted during what he described as a homophobic hate crime.

Almost immediately after the attack was reported, the Empire star’s fans banded together to show their support for him, but things quickly changed when the Chicago Police Department released details that suggested the entire attack was staged. In a matter of days, Jussie Smollett went from being the victim to the criminal.

Recent developments suggest his future may be uncertain. However, Illinois criminal attorneys Steven R. Hunter and Dustin E. Smith see things from a different perspective. According to Hollywood Life, Hunter and Smith are now sharing details about the charges Jussie Smollett is facing.

“Jussie received a class 4 felony for filing a false police report. Class 4 felonies are punishable by one to three years in the Illinois Department of Corrections,” Smith told the publication.

Although the staggering list of felony counts would seem intimidating to anyone, Hunter claims the three-year prison sentence does seem “unlikely.” However, Jussie Smollett’s pockets will likely suffer as a result of his alleged actions.

“I know there are a lot of charges, but in most situations, charges that stem out of the same conduct are not served in a consecutive sentence. What that means is that Jussie’s 16 charges won’t be multiplied by one to three years. It’s more likely to be a total of one to three years,” Smith explained.

So, how will Jussie Smollett’s legal team argue the case? Hunter and Smith went on to offer their prediction, explaining how the actor’s attorneys may use certain defenses to offer some form of explanation for his seemingly “erratic” actions.

“It wouldn’t surprise me if they come up with some type of drug or alcohol problem. Sometimes the defense could use it to help explain some of the erratic actions, if taken to be true,” Smith detailed.

The two attorneys went on to explain the type of probation that could come into play if it’s confirmed that Jussie Smollett has a drug problem. They explained that “‘TASC,’ which is Treatment Alternative for Safer Communities,” would likely be implemented.

The latest news about Jussie Smollett follows a string of reports about his attack. The singer and actor received overwhelming support until investigators arrested Nigerian brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo. The two were reportedly hired by Jussie to help him carry out the attack. After they were interviewed the brothers, Jussie was charged with filing a false police report. However, the actor still maintains his innocence."

The grand jury was convened a week after Smollett’s arrest for a single felony charge related to allegations that he had staged a homophobic hate crime in January; it returned the indictments on Thursday. Among them were additional charges that Smollett had “falsely reported batteries, aggravated batteries, and hate crimes,” per the Times. Chicago ABC affiliate ABC7 reports that the grand jury returned the indictments as two separate sets of charges—the first, related to Smollett’s initial police report, and the second, related to his follow-up interview with the police.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” said Smollett’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, in a statement upon receiving the indictments. Geragos went on to describe the 16 indictments as “prosecutorial overkill,” “redundant and vindictive,” and “desperate.” Cook County has yet to release a public statement about the indictment.

The Times has a helpful timeline laying the whole thing out, beginning with the alleged attack on January 29. Smollett says that he was walking in Chicago late at night when he was accosted by two men who poured bleach on him, shouted racist and homophobic epithets (and, apparently, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan), and secured a rope around his neck. After his attackers retreated, Smollett made his way to Northwestern Memorial Hospital and was swiftly discharged. At the time, the Chicago Police Department said it was “treating [the incident] as a possible hate crime”; there was a swift, vehement outpouring of celebrity support for Smollett, who made a planned concert appearance less than a week later.

But by the middle of February, the CPD had begun to investigate the incident as a hoax; the alleged attackers, apparently, had appeared as extras on Empire and the police said Smollett paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. By some accounts, Smollett was said to be upset with his salary or the prospect of being written out of Empire, compelling him to allegedly stage the crime; the team behind the show denied that Smollett was ever going to be written out. But, as the police department indicated in a statement to Vulture, the investigation has been plagued by leaks to the media, resulting in an often fuzzy portrait of a tangled, ugly situation. Smollett, however, is ""fiercely"" maintaining his innocence."

Jussie Smollett



US actor Jussie Smollett has been charged by a grand jury in Chicago on 16 counts, accused of falsely claiming to police that he had been the victim of a hate crime.

Prosecutors had previously charged him with one count of filing a false report.

The 36-year-old African-American actor told police he had been the victim of a homophobic and racist assault.

Police say he staged the attack in an attempt to further his acting career.

Last month he was suspended from the Empire TV show he starred in.Sources told NBC and CNN Mr Smollett had apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence.

What is Jussie Smollett accused of?

Mr Smollett is accused of paying two brothers to stage the attack on 29 January. Chicago officials also believe that he sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand.

He was charged with making a false statement to police and, on Thursday, a grand jury returned 16 counts of disorderly conduct against him.

At an earlier hearing, a judge set the actor’s bail at $100,000 (£76,000).

Mr Smollett denies all the charges against him and will appear in court on 16 March.

His lawyers have said they will “mount an aggressive defence” of Mr Smollett, who they described as “a young man of impeccable character”.

What did he say had happened?

Mr Smollett said two white men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him when he went out late at night to buy food from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago.

He said they then punched him, poured a potentially chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck – a reference to racist lynchings of African-Americans.

He also claimed the men said “this is Maga country” during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again”.

How has the case unfolded?

Officers began to grow suspicious when they were unable to find any footage of the incident, despite reviewing more than 50 surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses.

But investigators say they managed to use a ride-sharing app to track and identify two brothers who were filmed near the scene.

The men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, flew to Nigeria after the alleged attack. On their return they were held for almost 48 hours.

Officials said they were released without charge after providing information that “shifted the trajectory of the investigation”.

One of the brothers is Mr Smollett’s personal trainer, and both had worked as extras on Empire.

Police say they have a cheque, signed by Mr Smollett, which showed that he had agreed to pay the brothers $3,500.

Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Mr Smollett told at least one of the brothers that he was “dissatisfied” with his salary on the show. According to the Huffington Post, he was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role.

In a press conference, Supt Johnson called the alleged scheme “shameful”, adding: “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

He also accused Mr Smollett of taking “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career”.

Mr Smollett turned himself in shortly afterwards.

The former Empire actor was arrested after allegedly orchestrating a hate crime against himself, though he was released from prison after posting $10,000 of a $100,000 bond. At the hearing, Judge Steven Gregory Watkins allowed Smollett to travel to California and New York to meet with his lawyers, though he also ordered Smollett to appear at every future court hearing. The next one is scheduled for April 17th.

**

A grand jury indicted Jussie Smollett with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct Thursday, adding to the Empire actor’s legal woes after he allegedly orchestrated a hate crime against himself.

Each count of “false report of offense” is a Class 4 felony and, if convicted, Smollett could face up to three years in prison. The actor previously pleaded not guilty when arrested on a felony charge that he filed a false police report stemming from the January 29th attack in Chicago.

“Allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model,” Chicago police chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Friday, when the grand jury indictment was unsealed. “We stand behind the work of detectives & refer any comment on indictment to prosecutors.”

Smollett’s lawyer Mark Geragos called the grand jury indictment “redundant and vindictive” and said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Reuters reported.

The 16 charges stem from each false claim that Smollett told police in two separate interviews in regards to the alleged “hate crime,” including that his attackers poured an unknown chemical on him and yelled homophobic and racist slurs at him.

In the grand jury indictment, each count summarizes Smollett’s statement to police following the January 29th attack. “Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission [to police] there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” the indictment claims.

“[The grand jury] decided he told multiple lies,” CBS 2 Chicago legal analyst Irv Miller said. “There were going to charge him for each. If you have a crime, and that crime has multiple parts to it, you charge all those separate parts.”

Smollett remains out on bail following his February 21st arrest; he won’t be re-arrested following the grand jury indictment because it pertains to the same case. Smollett, who was written out of Empire‘s final episodes this season following his arrest, will be arraigned on the new charges on March 14th."

According to Chicago’s ABC 7 News, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed the indictment, which was reportedly returned by the grand jury on Thursday.

This complicates Smollett’s legal situation significantly; he was originally charged on Feb. 20 with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, but now faces 16 counts.

The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, reports ABC 7 News, with the first set of charges related to the initial report Smollett made to police when he told officers that his alleged attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their fists, placed a noose around his neck and poured a chemical liquid on him.

The second set of charges are related to Smollett’s second interview with police, which took place later that same day.

The new set of charges each carry a potential sentence of probation to four years in prison; if he were to convicted on all counts, Smollett could face a maximum sentence of up to 48 years.

Smollett has already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge, and was taken into custody; he is currently free on $100,000 bond.

“Experts believe it is likely he will strike a plea deal and potentially not spend time in prison,” reports the Chicago news outlet.

Following the indictments, Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi issued a statement via Twitter, noting that the “allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbour & respected him as a role model. We stand behind the work of detectives & refer any comment on indictment to prosecutors.”

Smollett’s lawyer Mark Geragos, however, is firing back by blasting the indictments as “redundant and vindictive,” and an example of “prosecutorial overkill” in order to distract from the Chicago PD’s internal investigation into leaks of information regarding the case.

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected,” said Geragos, as reported by Deadline. “We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.”

He added: “What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records,” the lawyer asserted. “Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Smollett is due to return to court on March 14."

According to TMZ, Smollett’s career was going pretty well before the alleged assault; he was getting offers every other week, and sometimes weekly. Right after the incident was initially reported, his celebrity rose even further. TMZ reports that he was getting nonstop proposals for movies, TV, commercials, interviews, and appearances.

But clearly the story backfired when he was charged with a felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing false police report. From there, the calls stopped and Smollett was an outcast. Matters became worse this week when he was indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett’s character on Empire was also removed from the final two episodes of Season 5, particularly because his co-stars have differing views on the attack.

Smollett's grand jury indictment arrived as two separate sets of charges: The first set pertains to what Smollett told authorities about the purported attack, including what the two men did and said to him; the second pertains to the second interview Smollett gave to the police on the day of the attack.

On Thursday, the Chicago Police Department also launched an internal investigation into the leaked information from his case. While that might help his case, it probably won’t help his career."

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected, said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

""The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what's called a probable cause proceeding.I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,"" Geragos told NBC's ""Access"" after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on Feb. 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett's bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had ""no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.""

Since Smollett's arrest, the producers of ""Empire"" announced that the actor's character would be removed from the season's final two episodes."

Empire actor Jussie Smollett (centre) has been indicted by a grand jury in Chicago.

A CHICAGO JURY has indicted American actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts after allegedly lying to police about being the victim of a racist, homophobic hate crime.

Police say Smollett – who gained fame on Fox musical drama “Empire” – staged the attack in a bid to gain publicity and a bigger paycheck.

Instead, the 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay, has been dropped from the last two episodes of the show’s current season, and his future is now in the hands of the court.

Smollett was charged last month with one felony count of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

He allegedly sent himself a threatening letter and then hired two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

According to court documents published online by local media, the 16-count indictment lists the specific statutes Smollett violated by telling police he had been attacked when he knew “there was no reasonable ground for believing” that such crimes had occurred.

Smollett has denied the allegations against him and in a statement to the media, his attorney Mark Geragos criticised the charges as “prosecutorial overkill”.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Geragos said.

The case has drawn intense national interest with everyone from politicians to celebrities and late night talk show hosts commenting.

When asked about the indictment, a Fox spokesman declined to comment.

Smollett was released on bond in February. He is next due back in court on 14 March.

Comments closed as the case is before the courts."

The Empire actor was initially charged with one Class 4 Felony charge of disorderly conduct last month but a grand jury has applied that charge 15 times over in an 36-page indictment that was returned on Thursday.

Now, he is facing a maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars and fines of up to $400,000.

Following the news Jussie's attorney, Mark Geragos, issued a blistering statement, calling it 'prosecutorial overkill', adding that the star 'adamantly maintains his innocence'.

Geragos told TMZ: 'The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.

'What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.'

Jussie Smollett now faces 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct which carry a maximum prison sentence of 48 years. His attorney, Mark Geragos, labelled the 16 count indictment he faces as 'overkill', 'vindictive' and a 'desperate attempt to make headlines'

Empire' TV series actor Jussie Smollett emerges from the Cook County Court last month

He added: 'This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records.

'Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.'

Geragos told CNN Smollett was the victim of a 'media gangbang' and 'media lynching'.

Smollett is expected to cut a plea deal with authorities, according to experts cited by ABC.

The new indictment divides the 15 new charges into two sets.

Counts one to seven apply to the comments he made to police officer Muhammed Baig, who first responded to his apartment when his friend called 911 on January 29.

The second set applies to Detective Kim Murray who interviewed him later that day.

Smollett is accused of hiring brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo to beat him up outside his apartment on January 29 in what he later described to police as a racist and homophobic attack.

The brothers say he paid them $3500 to do it and that he promised them an additional $500 which they would get when they came home from a trip to Nigeria.

They say Smollett's motive was that he wanted a higher salary on Empire.

The actor went on Good Morning America before he was arrested where he cried and insisted he was telling the truth amid a swelling tide of public cynicism.

Fox has said it is 'considering its options' in light of Smollett's arrest."

Italy's ambassador to Pakistan has confirmed the deaths of two missing European mountain climbers on Nanga Parbat, the world's ninth-tallest mountain.

The search for Briton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi ended after an aerial search team confirmed that silhouettes spotted at a height of about 5,900 meters (6,455 yards) were the bodies of the two climbers.

Ambassador Stefano Pontecorvo tweeted the news on Saturday, after Pakistani army helicopters with four rescuers had searched the mountain for days.

Ballard, 30, was the son of British climber Alison Hargreaves, the first woman to scale Mount Everest alone. She died at age 33 descending the summit of K2 in 1995.

Tom Ballard, 30, has been confirmed dead along with his Italian climbing partner Daniele Nardi. The pair had not made contact since February 24 when they were 20,000ft up Nanga Parbat

Ballard was a skilled climber, in 2015 becoming the first person to solo climb all six major north faces of the Alps in one winter. Nardi, 42, from near Rome, had attempted to scale Nanga Parbat in winter several times.

The pair set out on the climb on February 22, making it to the fourth base camp by the following day, but they last made contact on February 24 from an elevation of around 20,700ft (6,300m) on Nanga Parbat.

Ambassador Stefano Pontecorvo tweeted: 'With great sadness I inform that the search for @NardiDaniele and Tom Ballard is over as @AlexTxikon and the search team have confirmed that the silhouettes spotted on Mummery at about 5900 meters are those of Daniele and Tom. R.I.P.'

He said the bodies are in a place that is difficult to reach but that everything possible will be done to try to recover them.

Search plans were prevented on Thursday when Pakistan closed its air space after it shot down two Indian military planes, but two army helicopters were eventually drafted in.

Ballard's sister Kate, father Jim and Italian girlfriend Stefania Pederiva had been waiting for news of him, and Pederiva's mother said that she has been 'crying constantly' since learning that he was missing.

Ballard was born in Derbyshire but moved to Scotland in the same year his mother, Alison Hargreaves, died on K2 when she was 33 after becoming the first woman to conquer Everest unaided.

In the summer of 1993 she also became the first person to climb the notoriously perilous six great north faces of the Alps solo in a single season. The climb then inspired her book which was titled 'A Hard Day's Summer'.

Ballard was just six-years-old when his mother died but went on to follow in her footsteps and in 2015 he became the first person to climb the north faces alone in a winter season. His sister is also a mountaineer.

Although Ballard was really able to scale mountains with his mother, it is said that Alison had been six months pregnant with him when she scaled the treacherous north face of Eiger.

Despite being dubbed 'Killer Mountain' because of its dangerous conditions, the summit of Nanga Parbat has long drawn climbers.

Located in Pakistan's Gilgit Baltistan area, it is the ninth highest mountain in the world at 26,660ft (8,126m).

Ambassador Pontecorvo said the search team involving the Spaniards this week captured photos of the silhouettes and analysis confirmed that they were the missing climbers.

Mr Nardi's team posted a tribute on their official Facebook page.

They wrote: 'We're heartbroken; we inform you that the research of Daniele and Tom has ended. A part of them will always remain on the Nanga Parbat.'

They added: 'The family remembers Tom as a competent alpinist and brave friend of Daniele. Our thoughts are with him.

'Daniele will remain a husband, a father, a son, a brother and a friend lost for a dream that we have always accepted, respected and shared.

'We like to remember how you really are: in love with life, adventurous, scrupulous, courageous, loyal, attentive to detail and always present in times of need.'

Karrar Haidri, the secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, said the search team, headed by Spaniard Alex Txikon and experienced Pakistani mountaineer Ali Sadpara familiar with the peak, went on foot and used drones to search for the climbers.

Tom Ballard, 30, was reported missing earlier this week on the notorious K2 peak in the Pakistani Himalayas

In an interview with the Telegraph newspaper published before the news of Tom broke, his father Jim Ballard said Alison would have watched their son go into mountaineering 'with gritted teeth'.

‘But she would have been - no, she is - proud of what he has achieved. I hang on to that idea that Alison loved so much. “It is better to live one day as tiger than a thousand years as a sheep”, Mr Ballard said.

Jim Ballard told the Telegraph yesterday that although with Alison he had known immediately that she was not coming back, this time he had 'assumed there had been a technical problem and they would be OK'.

'This was different at first,' he said. 'All we knew was Tom and Daniele’s satellite phone had failed and that we had lost contact.

'I talked to Kate and assured her that they would be alright for 7 – 10 days maybe longer. I said he would be cold, have a bit of frost nip and certainly be very bad tempered as he often could be when coming back from a climb that had not gone according to plan.'

But as time went by it and the chances of finding his son alive become more remote, Mr Ballard said he just hoped that he had not suffered and had been feeling proud of his achievements when died.

'The other likelihood is that Tom and Daniele were simply blasted off the face of the mountain by a huge force of nature, thousands and thousands of tons of ice and snow. If that’s the case they probably knew nothing about it.

'I just pray that Tom had just finished negotiating an incredibly hard route and was pleased with himself. If he had to go that would have been the way. It was like his mum. She had just summited K2 and must have been feeling wonderful when K2 claimed her,' he told the Telegraph.

Sandy Allan, a family friend of the Ballards from Newtonmore in the Highlands, has climbed Nanga Parbat twice and previously admitted he was worried about the 'competent mountaineer'.

He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: 'I knew Tom when he was younger and I'd climbed with him and his mother, Tom's an exceptional climber, he's not done a great deal in the Himalayas but he's done enough to know how to look after himself very well.

'Some people thought Tom was a little bit of a loner but he climbed to a very high standard and I suppose a lot of his routes were quite esoteric.

'But he's a normal human being with a passion for climbing.

'It's a lot colder and that makes it incredibly uncomfortable but if you're a climber like Tom, it's one of the big challenges for people to do so I can understand why he'd want to go there.'"

Chicago Police Department(CHICAGO) — An Illinois grand jury has indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, according to the Cook County State Attorney’s Office.

Several hours after the grand jury indictments were announced late Friday, Smollett’s attorney issued a new statement, “adamantly” maintaining the actor’s innocence and accusing law enforcement of leaking details of the probe.

Yet proving Smollett’s innocence will be a tall order for celebrity attorney Mark Geragos, as the Chicago Police Department that investigated the alleged attack continues to publicly describes Smollett’s alleged actions as “shameful, [and] if proven, an affront to the people of Chicago.”

The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, Robert Foley, a senior advisor in the state attorney’s office told ABC News.

The first set is related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.

The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.

In a statement released on Twitter Friday evening, Chicago Police Department (CPD) spokesman Anthony Guglielmi referred calls to prosecutors about the grand jury indictments.

“As Superintendent [Eddie] Johnson stated, allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model. We stand behind the work of detectives…”

Geragos, a Los Angeles-based criminal defense lawyer whose clients have included Chris Brown, Michael Jackson and Winona Ryder, is taking an aggressive approach to Smollett’s defense — calling the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill” and a “desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal [CPD] investigation launched to investigate the … leaking of false information” about the Smollett probe.

Geragos also launched a broadside at employees of the hospital where Smollett was treated after the alleged incident for the “shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records.”

Earlier this week, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that the CPD had begun such an internal investigation into the leaks.

Meanwhile, dozens of employees at Northwestern Hospital where Smollett was treated after the alleged incident have been fired for improperly accessing the actor’s medical records, according to CBS Chicago affiliate WBBM.

Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was ordered to surrender his passport and taken into custody, after which he posted $100,000 bond to be freed.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men near his apartment in Chicago at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. The two men, Smollett initially said, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him as a rope was wrapped around his neck and an unknown chemical substance was poured on him. The alleged assailants yelled “MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan, Smollett told police.

Police identified and questioned two “persons of interest” captured on surveillance video near the scene around the time of the alleged attack. The men, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were arrested on Feb. 13 but then released without charges, with police saying they were no longer considered suspects.

While being questioned by investigators, the brothers claimed that Smollett paid them $3,500 to help orchestrate and stage the crime after he became upset that a threatening letter addressed to him and delivered on Jan. 22 to the Fox studio where “Empire” is filmed did not get enough attention, law enforcement sources told ABC News.

Smollett, who has consistently denied any role in staging the supposed crime, turned himself in last month.

A grand jury on Friday indicted Smollett on 16 felony charges relating to allegations that he staged a hate crime against himself in January. Gergagos defended his client during a Friday night appearance with CNN host Anderson Cooper.

WATCH:



“I defy anybody to find any indictment anywhere where somebody has brought 16 counts for being a victim of a hate crime,” Gergagos said, adding his belief that prosecutors have no evidence that the “Empire” actor was unhappy with the compensation he was receiving.

“What is happening here is frankly a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions, and that’s the reason I got into this,” Gergagos told Cooper. “I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty.”

Smollett’s attorney contended there is no police report and that his client “hasn’t been given one stitch of discovery.” He also explained the $3,500 allegedly paid to stage the incident as being for “training.”

“It wasn’t to pay anything!” he said. “So I don’t understand where any of this comes from. He supposedly was dissatisfied. There’s no evidence of that.” (RELATED: ‘Jussie’s Lie’ — ‘The Daily Show’ Makes Lifetime-Style Trailer For Smollett Movie)

“Why would these two brothers … why did they attack Jussie Smollett using Trump language and a noose and all these things?” Cooper asked.

“I haven’t interviewed them, but I will ask you this,” said Gergagos. “Why is it if they did this … why weren’t they indicted?”

“But doesn’t it just seem weird to you that you get allegedly attacked by two people who you know and you don’t seem to recognize them, even though you claimed you fought back and they ran away, and I believe initially Mr. Smollett said one of them was white, or they were white,” said Cooper. “Isn’t it just weird that you get allegedly attacked by two people you actually know who’ve actually been on ‘Empire’ that, who you have actually worked out with, and you don’t recognize them?”

“Yeah, but guess what?” Gergagos responded. “I don’t know whether he made that statement but what I do know is when he was told that they have evidence against these two he refused to sign the complaint because he did not believe it.”

“I haven’t seen one piece of evidence and they don’t have one piece of evidence that they’ve turned over that links Jussie to this. What they do have is a whale of a case … a great case against the two brothers.”

She closed with, “You constantly talked about wanting to be ‘relevant’. You’ve burned so many bridges that now the only time you are # relevant is when you headline with my family’s name next to yours. It’s time to stop these lies and live your own life.”

In 1993, Michael Jackson was accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy. In January of 1994, he reportedly settled for $23 million. The accuser’s father committed suicide in 2009, five months after the singer died. Jordan Chandler reportedly has never come forward about the allegations and supposedly lives outside of the country. In 2017, when Wade Robson, a choreographer who is featured in “Leaving Neverland,” accused Michael Jackson of sexual assault—even though he’d said in the past the singer didn’t assault him—there was a hunt to find Chandler. According to The Daily Mail, he left the U.S. to avoid investigators.

In 2003, Michael Jackson was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent to a 13-year-old boy. He was ultimately acquitted of all charges. Robson testified at the 2003 trial, but James Safechuck, the other person featured in “Leaving Neverland,” did not.

Michael Jackson was acquitted of all charges.

Now, the actor’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, is speaking out.

While talking to Anderson Cooper’s CNN, Geragos said, “What is happening here is frankly a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions. And that’s the reason I got into this. I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty.”

He continued, calling out the Chicago Police Department, “He hasn’t been given one stitch of discovery. There isn’t one police report. Your package just said he paid $3,500. I’ve got the texts. Those texts––and they conceded that the check and the texts were for training. It wasn’t to pay anything. So I don’t understand how it comes from.”

He also challenged the idea that Smollett did this because he wanted a higher salary at “Empire,”: “They have not talked to one person at Fox who has said he was dissatisfied with his money. They have not interviewed one person connected with the show ‘Empire; who says he was dissatisfied with his money. They are the ones that started their internal investigation about the leaks because all of the information that was being leaked was false.” He also accuses Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson of tainting the jury pool.

Watch Geragos below:

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

The Chicago Police Department claimed the Nigerian-American brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo told them the attack was orchestrated by the “Empire” actor and that they were paid $3,500. However, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” and “went too far” when they said Jussie sent a hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself.

TMZ also reported, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson may have also gone too far when he said Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.'” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated March 7 and made public on March 8 gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the Black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a White man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are Black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is Black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged.

Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of Black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment."

Prosecutors had previously charged him with one count of filing a false report.

The 36-year-old African-American actor told police he had been the victim of a homophobic and racist assault.

Police say he staged the attack in an attempt to further his acting career.

Last month he was suspended from the Empire TV show he starred in.Sources told NBC and CNN Mr Smollett had apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence.

What is Jussie Smollett accused of?

Mr Smollett is accused of paying two brothers to stage the attack on 29 January. Chicago officials also believe that he sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand.

He was charged with making a false statement to police and, on Thursday, a grand jury returned 16 counts of disorderly conduct against him.

At an earlier hearing, a judge set the actor’s bail at $100,000 (£76,000).

Mr Smollett denies all the charges against him and will appear in court on 16 March.

His lawyers have said they will “mount an aggressive defence” of Mr Smollett, who they described as “a young man of impeccable character”.

What did he say had happened?

Mr Smollett said two white men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him when he went out late at night to buy food from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago.

He said they then punched him, poured a potentially chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck – a reference to racist lynchings of African-Americans.

He also claimed the men said “this is Maga country” during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again”.

How has the case unfolded?

Officers began to grow suspicious when they were unable to find any footage of the incident, despite reviewing more than 50 surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses.

But investigators say they managed to use a ride-sharing app to track and identify two brothers who were filmed near the scene.

The men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, flew to Nigeria after the alleged attack. On their return they were held for almost 48 hours.

Officials said they were released without charge after providing information that “shifted the trajectory of the investigation”.

One of the brothers is Mr Smollett’s personal trainer, and both had worked as extras on Empire.

Police say they have a cheque, signed by Mr Smollett, which showed that he had agreed to pay the brothers $3,500.

Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Mr Smollett told at least one of the brothers that he was “dissatisfied” with his salary on the show. According to the Huffington Post, he was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role.

In a press conference, Supt Johnson called the alleged scheme “shameful”, adding: “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

He also accused Mr Smollett of taking “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career”.

Mr Smollett turned himself in shortly afterwards.

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for making a false report of an attack on him in Chicago. Local media have reported that the Chicago Police Department is investigating leaks to reporters during the investigation of the reported attack.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and openly gay, plays Jamal Lyon on Fox's hit TV show, ""Empire,"" a drama that chronicles a family-run record label. He told police he was attacked by two masked men when he was returning home from a Subway sandwich store in late January around 2 a.m.

Smollett claimed the two men had beat him, said homophobic and racial slurs and put a looped rope around his neck before fleeing. He said he heard, ""this is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Trump's campaign slogan.

Police said Smollett staged the attack and recruited two brothers to participate.

The executive producers of ""Empire"" said last month they are removing Jussie Smollett's character from the last two episodes of the show's season ""to avoid further disruption on set.""

""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,"" the producers said."

The consequences deriving from the allegedly false hate crime report of Jussie Smollett are vast. The expression ""collateral damage"" is appropriate.

At least 50 employees may have been fired from Northwestern Memorial Hospital for accessing the medical profile and records of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett without authorization, sources with knowledge of the situation said.

One of those employees — identified simply as Susan, to protect her identity — said that with one click of her mouse, she was fired from her job as a surgical nurse last week.

""Simply put, it was just morbid curiosity,"" she said. ""I went into the charting system and started to search his name.""

""I clicked just once,"" Susan said. ""I never clicked into his chart.""

Susan said she was fired on the spot for violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, that sets standards for patient privacy and confidentiality.

The Chicago Sun-Times reports on other hospital employees telling similar tales:

The Northwestern Memorial Hospital employee thought nothing of it when a coworker walked over to her desk and asked if ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett had been admitted under an alias. Now, the employee — an administrator with an advanced degree — is out of a job, after she was told she'd inappropriately accessed Smollett's records, violating hospital rules. The administrator, who didn't want her name used, told the Chicago Sun-Times she was stunned by her dismissal — and she suspects others may have been fired or disciplined for doing the same thing. ""I didn't get any information about [Smollett]. I never clicked on his name and entered his record,"" said the former administrator.

The haste with which the firings allegedly took place is curious. Of course, Smollett deserves the same level of respect for his medical privacy as everyone else. But the real problem, in my view, is the scandalous ease with which any American's confidential medical records are available to literally millions of other Americans — not just credentialed medical professionals like doctors and nurses, but comparatively low-level administrative people who can pull up records with a mouse click or two. With Obamacare forcing doctors to fill out forms on computers every time they see a patient, accessibility to medical records online is greater than ever.

If you think your private medical records are secure, you are living in a dreamland.

Because of the enormous media attention showered on Smollett, huge amounts of police, prosecutorial, and other official resources were expended on the case, even as unsolved murders continued to pile up in Chicago. The families of the victims of those unsolved murders are suffering all the more thanks to the resources drained by the investigation, and now prosecution of his alleged hoax.

Now Northwestern Hospital in Chicago will have to recruit, interview, train, and break in ""at least 50"" new employees to replace those who have been fired. Typically, this process costs many thousands of dollars per employee, meaning that hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra costs have been loaded onto the hospital, money that must be recovered from insurance companies, Medicare, and individuals paying their own hospital bills.

It is quite apparent that with so many employees casually violating HIPAA, training on the importance of respecting medical privacy is inadequate. The fired employees should have known better, but they didn't.

Coming soon: firings from the Chicago Police Department over leaks to the media:

Chicago police have opened an internal investigation into leaks in the investigation of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett's reported attack, police confirmed Thursday. ""I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,"" Sergeant Rocco Alioto, a CPD spokesperson, said in a statement. ""As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.""

If Smollett's case had not been in an intense spotlight, I doubt that the people accessing his private data would ever have been noticed.

Diehard jihadists swelling Syrian refugee camps have vowed revenge as the last remaining ISIS holdout in Syria faced imminent collapse.

One veiled woman, feared to be among thousands of unrepentant fanatics who have fled Baghouz and surrendered to US-backed Kurdish forces, chillingly warned: 'We will seek vengeance, there will be blood up to your knees.

'We have left, but there will be new conquests in the future.'

The civilians have continued to stream out of the ragged tent encampment the village of Baghouz since December.

As they came out of their bastion in eastern Syria, many civilians are unrepentant and promise bloody vengeance against the enemies of ISIS. A veiled woman is pictured walking towards a screening point as hundreds of civilians, who streamed out of the Islamic State group's last Syrian stronghold, arrive in an area run by US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces outside Baghouz in the eastern Syria

The US-backed Kurdish coalition forces thought only a few families remained in the enclave - but they now fear they may have severely underestimated the number of brainwashed ISIS followers left inside.

12,000 people from Baghouz arrived in one camp for non-combatants in northern Syria in the past 48 hours.

As they came out of their bastion in eastern Syria, many are unrepentant and told media bloody vengeance against the enemies of ISIS.

At an outpost for US-backed forces outside the village, 10 women stood in front of journalists, pointing their index fingers to the sky and shouted: 'The Islamic State is here to stay!'

The gesture is used by IS supporters to proclaim the oneness of God.

Many of the women leaving the bastion told AFP they wanted to raise their children using ISIS ideology.

One 60-year-woman, who did not want to be named, said that ISIS will continue because the boys under the terror group's rule have been trained to fight from a young age.

She said: 'The caliphate will not end, because it has been ingrained in the hearts and brains of the newborns and the little ones.'

Some of the civilians threw rocks at the cameras of those trying to film them, while one screamed at a photographer and calls him a pig.

Nearby, a bearded man with a leg wound cursed the coalition, whose warplanes have pummelled the last jihadist redoubt.

""I only surrendered because of my injury,"" he says. ""I have been with IS since the beginning.

Despite US-backed Kurdish fighters hopes that the final day has come for the ISIS 'caliphate', - its last tiny sliver of land just won't seem to empty.

'When we began the operation we knew there would be civilians, but not in such a big number,' Adnan Afrin, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, said Thursday.

In recent days thousands more men and women - including those who once flocked to join IS from across the globe - left the IS pocket, upending assumptions that only a few families remained holed up in Baghouz and those who refused to leave or surrender were choosing to die there.

'They're coming from underground... they're never-ending,' said one SDF official.

ISIS forces fleeing the village of Baghouz in the eastern Deir Ezzor province have been cornered into a small piece of land between US-backed forces and a riverbank

The International Rescue Committee on Friday said as many as 12,000 people from Baghouz have arrived in one camp for non-combatants in northeast Syria over the past 48 hours, including some 6,000 people on Thursday alone.

The women trucked out of the bastion this week gave drastically varying figures on the holdout families that remain in the bombed-out and besieged jihadist bastion.

'There's still more,' said Umm Aboud from the northern Syrian city of Al-Bab.

'You see how many people have come out in the past few days, there's that many still inside,' said the mother of four, her bright green eyes peering through a black veil.

Footage obtained from the Free Burma Rangers, a Christian aid group run by a former US special forces operative, showed hundreds of people still remained in the riverside camp

More than 55,000 civilians have arrived in the Kurdish-run Al-Hol camp since December, according to the International Rescue Committee.

'The IRC and other agencies are doing all they can do help the new arrivals but Al-Hol camp is now at breaking point,' the organisation said Friday.

'No one could have guessed that such a large number of women and children were still living in Baghouz.'

Black-clad women trucked out of Baghouz in the past few days have said they were living crammed together in trenches, tents and cars near.

'There are thousands of families leaving... but there were thousands and thousands of families there, even I was surprised,' 35-year-old Umm Alaa, from the Iraqi town of Heet, said Wednesday after fleeing.

The mother of 10 said she lost a child last week due to hunger as the situation grew increasingly desperate.

Footage obtained from the Free Burma Rangers, a Christian aid group run by a former US special forces operative, showed hundreds of people still remained in the riverside camp.

In the images said to have been taken Thursday, women draped in black are seen walking through the came around overturned cars and scraps of twisted metal which lay on the ground.

The aid group has come in close proximity to the camp in recent days and its head, David Eubank, said some two thousand people could remain inside.

Analyst Mutlu Civiroglu, on the ground in eastern Syria, said that IS was purposefully trying to conceal its numbers.

They have regularly been 'releasing certain numbers of people, including fighters, in controlled amounts' in an attempt to buy time, he said.

'If they really wanted to surrender, they would have... and if they wanted to fight again, they could have,' he added.

The delay was 'a deliberate effort, maybe to prepare for something else... what that is though is unclear'.

ISIS created a proto-state across large parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014, ruling millions of people, but has since lost all of it except a tiny patch in Baghouz by the Euphrates River.

Some of the last IS fighters and their families were cornered on Friday on the water's edge.

They were caught between advancing Kurdish forces and Syrian regime fighters across the river.

But General Joseph Votel, head of the US Central Command, warned today that many of those being evacuated from the area are 'unrepentant, unbroken and radicalised'.

He told Congress the fight against ISIS was 'far from over', and stressed the need to 'maintain a vigilant offensive against this now widely dispersed and disaggregated organisation'.

General Joseph Votel, who oversees US operations in the Middle East, said ISIS fighters had already dispersed across Iraq and Syria and remained radicalised.

He told the House Armed Services congressional committee: 'Reduction of the physical caliphate is a monumental military accomplishment but the fight against Isis and violent extremism is far from over.

'What we are seeing now is not the surrender of ISIS as an organisation but a calculated decision to preserve the safety of their families and the preservation of their capabilities by taking their chances in camps for internally displaced persons and going to ground in remote areas and waiting for the right time to resurge.

He added: 'We will need to maintain a vigilant offensive against this now widely dispersed and disaggregated organisation that includes leaders, fighters, facilitators, resources and toxic ideology.

'The ISIS population being evacuated from the remaining vestiges of the caliphate largely remains unrepentant, unbroken and radicalised.'

As the so-called caliphate crumbles, many Western countries have struggled to decide what to do with its citizens returning from the fighting.

Donald Trump urged European countries to take back their suspected fighters and try them in their own countries, threatening via Twitter that US-backed forces in Syria would release the militants into Europe.

The Kurds also want foreign nations to repatriate their citizens and jail them in their lands, but are willing to make compromises if the international community will provide the funding and security for new prisons.

Last month Iraq announced a group of 13 French citizens accused of fighting for ISIS are to be tried in the country rather than face charges in their home country.

And the Kurdish government in Syria said if Britain and other European countries will not take back their jihadi citizens, then international tribunals, similar to the Nuremberg trials used to convict Nazi's after the Second World War, could be set up to deal with the problem.

A woman who alleges R. Kelly sexually abused her when she was just 13 years old has agreed to testify against the singer. The 'Ignition' hitmaker is facing 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse after four women accused him of sexually abusing them, three of whom claim they were underage at the time of the alleged incidents. And according to The Blast, a new accuser has now come forward to claim she was victimised by the singer when she was a teenager 20 years ago, and is willing to testify against him in court. Gloria Allred revealed on Friday (08.03.19) that she will be representing the unnamed woman - whose identity is being kept secret - and said the woman had already been interviewed by law enforcement. The Blast reports Gloria confirmed the woman is willing to ""testify under oath"" about the allegations of sexual abuse, and says she came forward with her claims after ""listening to R. Kelly's denials about what he did to underage girls like me was very hurtful.""

Gloria added that the woman is making it clear that ""he was the adult and I was the child. He had no right to take advantage of me when I was only a 13-year-old child.""

The woman's allegations come after Kelly denied all charges against him during an interview earlier this week, before he became emotional and claimed his critics are ""trying to kill"" him.

He said: ""Quit playing, I didn't do this stuff.

""This is not me. I'm fighting for my f*****g life! Y'all killing me with this s**t! I've given you 30 years of my f****g career! 30 years of my career! Y'all trying to kill me! You're killing me man!

9:30 p.m.

An attorney for Jussie Smollett says a 16-count indictment against the “Empire” actor is “vindictive” and Smollett “maintains his innocence.”

Mark Geragos says in a statement that he did not expect a Cook County grand jury would charge Smollet with 16 separate counts and the indictment is “prosecutorial overkill.”

He says the indictment “is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy.”

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for making a false report of an attack on him in Chicago. Police say Smollett staged the attack and recruited two brothers to participate. Local media have reported that the Chicago Police Department is investigating leaks to reporters during the investigation of the reported attack.

5:30 p.m.

The16-county grand jury indictment of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett relates to allegations that he lied to police about a reported attack in January — eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker’s eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack.

4:50 p.m.

A grand jury in Chicago has indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment filed Thursday charges him with falsely reporting an offense.

Smollett was charged on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett, who is black and gay, told police in late January that he was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago who wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police say Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

Each count of providing a “false report of offense” is a class 4 felony punishable by up to four years in prison, meaning the actor faces a total of 64 years behind bars for sending Chicago authorities on an expensive wild goose chase over a hate crime that never actually occurred.

View the full indictment below:

Despite a trove of evidence showing that Smollett had lied when he claimed in late January that two white Trump supporters had assaulted him, poured bleach on him and placed a noose around his neck, all while allegedly yelling racial and homophobic slurs and shouting, “This is MAGA country,” both the actor and his attorney continue to proclaim his innocence.

“I defy anybody to find any indictment anywhere where somebody has brought 16 counts for being a victim of a hate crime,” his attorney Mark Gergagos kvetched on CNN Friday evening.

Except the evidence makes it clear Smollett was the victim of nothing more than his own greed.

“This stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary, so he concocted a story about being attacked,” Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson revealed at a presser late last month, referring to the actor’s salary for his role on the TV show “Empire.”

Gergagos then aimed his fury at the media, slamming them for finally accurately reporting the actor’s crimes to the public. Never mind that the media spent most of February portraying Smollett as a victim and falsely linking his attacked to President Donald Trump’s alleged racism.

“What is happening here is frankly a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions,” he said. “I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty.”

Listen:

Facts are stubborn things … though Smollett’s attorney did have a point about the “media pendulum swing.” The media initially bought the actor’s claims hook, line and sinker.

Gergagos continued by denying that his client had hired two Nigerian brothers and fellow “Empire” actors to stage the hoax attack on Jan. 31. Never mind the video evidence showing the brothers purchasing the very items that were used in the staged attack. And never mind that both brothers admitted to local authorities that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack.

CNN host Anderson Cooper was unimpressed by Gergagos’ claims.

“But doesn’t it just seem weird to you that you get allegedly attacked by two people who you know and you don’t claim to recognize them, even you claimed you fought back and they ran away, and I believe initially Mr. Smollett said one of them was white, or they were white,” he said.

“Isn’t it just weird that you get allegedly attacked by two people you actually know that have been on Empire that, who you have actually worked out with, and you don’t recognize them?”

Listen to Geragos’ nonsensical response below:

In a statement to People magazine, Geragos took a stab at Chicago authorities as well.

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records,” he said.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

But local authorities haven’t robbed him of his alleged “innocence.” Thanks to America’s system of due process — one that Smollett had once sought to deny to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanagh — he’ll have his day in court like any other alleged criminal.

It’s interesting how he’s singing a different tune now that the tables have turned.

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,” his legal counsel said to Fox News. “Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Funny how that works …

Smollett – who was dropped from the final two episodes of this season's Empire television show amid fallout from the incident – was charged last month with one felony count of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

The specific charges against Smollett in the 16-count indictment were not immediately clear, but a local CBS affiliate said it alleges the actor knew ""there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed.""

Smollett, who is gay and black, allegedly sent himself a threatening letter and then hired two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump's ""Make American Great Again"" slogan.

Chicago police said the 36-year-old actor engineered the elaborate hoax to exploit Americans' anxieties over political and racial divisions in a bid to score publicity and a bigger paycheck.

The case has drawn intense national interest with everyone from politicians to celebrities and late night talk show hosts commenting.

First is from his conversation with the police about being the subject of racial and homophobic slurs, getting physically assaulted and having a rope around his neck in addition with exposure to a chemical substance.

The second is related to another interview with the police describing the incident.

Jussie Smollett's lawyer is Mark Geragos who has represented the likes of Chris Brown and Michael Jackson.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The federal budget deficit is ballooning on President Donald Trump's watch and few in Washington seem to care.

And even if they did, the political dynamics that enabled bipartisan deficit-cutting deals decades ago has disappeared, replaced by bitter partisanship and chronic dysfunction.

That's the reality that will greet Trump's latest budget , which will promptly be shelved after landing with a thud on Monday. Like previous spending blueprints, Trump's plan for the 2020 budget year will propose cuts to many domestic programs favored by lawmakers in both parties but leave alone politically popular retirement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

Washington probably will devote months to wrestling over erasing the last remnants of a failed 2011 budget deal that would otherwise cut core Pentagon operations by $71 billion and domestic agencies and foreign aid by $55 billion. Top lawmakers are pushing for a reprise of three prior deals to use spending cuts or new revenues and prop up additional spending rather than defray deficits that are again approaching $1 trillion.

It's put deficit hawks in a gloomy mood.

For Jussie Smollett, 1 story equals 16 felony counts

CHICAGO (AP) - News that a grand jury had indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct - the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police - are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren't uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett's comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

""What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,"" said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, called the 16-count indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" But prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it's the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

R. Kelly: 'We're going to straighten all this stuff out'

CHICAGO (AP) - R. Kelly walked out of a Chicago jail on Saturday after someone who officials say did not want to be publicly identified paid $161,633 that the R&B singer owed in back child support.

Kelly, who was ordered taken into custody on Wednesday by a judge after Kelly said he didn't have the entire amount he owed, briefly spoke with reporters, telling them: ""I promise you, we're going to straighten all this stuff out."" He said that was all he could say, a stark contrast to a nationally televised broadcast that aired earlier in the week in which he cried and ranted about being ""assassinated"" by allegations of sexual abuse that led to criminal charges last month.

Cara Smith, the chief policy officer for the Cook County sheriff's office, which runs the jail, said a person who wished to remain anonymous handed a check on Saturday morning to the county clerk's office for the full amount of Kelly's back child support. A bond slip where people putting up money to secure an inmate's release write their names and relationship to the inmate was left blank, Smith said.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, said he could not discuss the child support payment because of a judge's gag order in that case.

As is done with other high-profile inmates, Kelly, 52, was held in a solo cell under round-the-clock observation.

Pot-litics: 2020 Democrats line up behind legalization

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A growing list of Democratic presidential contenders want the U.S. government to legalize marijuana, reflecting a nationwide shift as more Americans look favorably on cannabis.

Making marijuana legal at the federal level is the ""smart thing to do,"" says California Sen. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor whose home state is the nation's largest legal pot shop. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a prominent legalization advocate on Capitol Hill, says the war on drugs has been a ""war on people.""

Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, who appears poised to join the 2020 Democratic field, has written a book arguing marijuana legalization would hobble drug cartels. In an email to supporters this week, he called again to end the federal prohibition on marijuana.

""Who is going to be the last man - more likely than not a black man - to languish behind bars for possessing or using marijuana when it is legal in some form in more than half of the states in this country?"" O'Rourke wrote.

It's a far different approach from the not-so-distant past, when it was seen as politically damaging to acknowledge smoking pot and no major presidential candidate backed legalization.

Turbulence injures 30 on flight from Istanbul to New York

NEW YORK (AP) - Severe turbulence over the Atlantic Ocean tossed terrified passengers and crew around a Turkish Airlines plane cabin on Saturday, with 30 people suffering bumps, bruises, cuts and a broken leg before the flight landed safely at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, officials said.

Dozens of ambulances lined up in front of a terminal to quickly treat the injured coming off the flight that left Istanbul for the 10-hour trip.

Spokesman Steve Coleman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told The Associated Press that 28 people were taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens after the plane touched down at 5:35 p.m. Two went to Queens Hospital Medical Center. A flight attendant suffered a broken leg, Coleman said.

Turkish Airlines Flight 1 hit the turbulence about 45 minutes before landing at JFK, Coleman said. The crew declared an emergency while the Boeing 777 was still in the air, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

The Port Authority spokesman said other airport operations were not affected.

Trump signed Bibles. Heresy? Many religious leaders say no

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - President Donald Trump was just doing what he could to raise spirits when he signed Bibles at an Alabama church for survivors of a tornado outbreak, many religious leaders say, though some are offended and others say he could have handled it differently.

Hershael York, dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary School of Theology in Louisville, Kentucky, said he didn't have a problem with Trump signing Bibles, like former presidents have, because he was asked and because it was important to the people who were asking.

""Though we don't have a national faith, there is faith in our nation, and so it's not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their Bibles,"" he said. ""Those Bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are, too.""

But the Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, said she was offended by the way Trump scrawled his signature Friday as he autographed Bibles and other things, including hats, and posed for photos. She viewed it, she said, as a ""calculated political move"" by the Republican president to court his evangelical voting base.

Presidents have a long history of signing Bibles, though earlier presidents typically signed them as gifts to send with a spiritual message. President Ronald Reagan signed a Bible that was sent secretly to Iranian officials in 1986. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the family Bible his attorney general used to take the oath of office in 1939.

Wanted: More pastures for West's overpopulated wild horses

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) - If you ever wished to gaze at a stomping, snorting, neighing panorama of Western heritage from your living-room window, now could be your chance.

A classic image of the American West - wild horses stampeding across the landscape - not only has endured through the years but has multiplied past the point of range damage. Through May 3, the U.S. government is seeking more private pastures for an overpopulation of wild horses.

Many consider rounding up wild horses to live out their lives on private pastures a reasonable approach to a tricky problem. Wild horses, after all, not only have romantic value, they are protected by federal law.

Just keep in mind a few of the dozens of requirements for getting paid by the government to provide wild horses a home.

""It's not like you can do this in your backyard, or even a 5 acre (2 hectare) plot,"" said Debbie Collins, outreach specialist for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's Wild Horse and Burro Program in Norman, Oklahoma.

More blackouts hit Venezuela as opposition, government rally

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - The Venezuelan opposition and government loyalists held rival demonstrations in Caracas on Saturday, as both sides prepared for what some fear could be a protracted power struggle.

The rallies unfolded as power and communications outages continued to hit Venezuela, intensifying the hardship of a country paralyzed by economic and political crisis. The blackouts heightened tension between the bitterly divided factions, which accused each other of being responsible for the collapse of the power grid.

""Hard times are ahead,"" said opposition leader Juan Guaido, who addressed crowds with a loudspeaker after security forces earlier dismantled a speakers' stage that the opposition had erected. He said he planned to tour Venezuela to seek support and lay the groundwork for a massive rally in Caracas.

The 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly said he anticipated more government efforts to sideline and intimidate the opposition. However, President Nicolas Maduro's government has not moved directly against Guaido since he returned to Venezuela from a Latin American tour Monday.

Guaido earlier speculated that Maduro was effectively ignoring him in an attempt to sap the energy of the opposition, whose hopes of ousting the government have so far been stymied.

AP Explains: What Facebook's 'privacy vision' really means

NEW YORK (AP) - Mark Zuckerberg's abrupt Wednesday declaration of a new ""privacy vision "" for social networking was for many people a sort of Rorschach test.

Looked at one way, the manifesto read as an apology of sorts for Facebook's history of privacy transgressions, and suggested that the social network would de-emphasize its huge public social network in favor of private messaging between individuals and among small groups.

Looked at another, it turned Facebook into a kind of privacy champion by embracing encrypted messaging that's shielded from prying eyes - including those of Facebook itself.

Yet another reading suggested the whole thing was a public-relations exercise designed to lull its users while Facebook entrenches its competitive position in messaging and uses it to develop new sources of user data to feed its voracious advertising machine.

As with many things Facebook, the truth lies somewhere in between. Facebook so far isn't elaborating much on Zuckerberg's manifesto. Here's a guide to what we know at the moment about its plans.

Time isn't on your side with coming shift to daylight saving

WASHINGTON (AP) - Time isn't on your side this weekend.

One less hour (of sleep) isn't the end of the world, but you may be a bit sleepier Sunday morning.

Time to abide by the adage to spring forward (though it's not yet spring). The shift from standard to daylight saving time comes at 2 a.m. local time Sunday across most of the United States. Consider setting clocks an hour ahead before bed Saturday night.

Daylight will begin to last longer into the evening but the sun will take an hour longer to emerge in the morning.

No time change is observed in Hawaii, most of Arizona, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas."

Pat Arbor certainly was.

Specifically — 8 months, 21 days, 27 minutes.

It was 7:30 p.m. last May 25, when former Chicago Board of Trade chief Pat Arbor was sent to Cook County Jail for civil contempt of court; led handcuffed through the tunnels to Cook County Jail’s Cermak Hospital; and placed in an isolated cell for protection.

“I was the 268th inmate to enter that night,” said Arbor.

On Valentine’s Day, he exited.

“I had little to say the day I was freed,” Arbor said.

That was then.

This is now.

OPINION

“It was pretty powerful that first night in jail,” said Arbor, whose travails stemmed from a messy 2013 divorce settlement.

Described as a globetrotting fugitive and a flight risk because of his penchant for living outside the U.S. since 2013 — specifically Italy — Arbor, a non-smoker and non-drinker who exercised frequently, is now spending most of his time with his children, old pals, and going to the doctor for frail health and injuries due to a complete lack of exercise.

Arbor, who spent his 81st birthday in jail, is now precluded from discussing the gag ordered financial divorce settlement with his ex-wife.

“I’m not going to talk about it because I can’t,” he said. “Let’s just say I had some angels out there.”

“But being in jail really had a profound effect on me,” he added. “It’s a tough place; isolation is rough. But there is the power of silence. I did start praying. There was no texting. No tech. I did a lot of thinking. I just thought of it as a religious retreat at times to get rid of anger.

“I was able to endure the isolation because I had a tough childhood. When I misbehaved, my mother would put me in a dark basement. You learn not to fight it. To manage it.”

Arbor, who was basically raised at Mercy Boys Home because of a disappearing father and his mother’s eventual suicide, claims the jail guards were disciplined and professional and did the best they could under the circumstances. “And the outpouring of friends who visited and the books they brought made a huge difference,” he said.

Valentine’s Day end to divorce drama: Pat Arbor ‘delighted to be out’ of jail

Judge risks 81-year-old Pat Arbor dying in jail, ex-CBOT chief’s lawyer says

‘I’m kind of doomed,’ says ex-CBOT chairman, jailed for months in divorce fight

“If I’d get depressed, I’d think about what John McCain had endured at the Hanoi Hilton in Vietnam and realize my incarceration was a piece of cake.”

Arbor claims there is one thing he can’t get out of his head.

“I thought I had seen it all, but there are things I will never forget,” he told Sneed.

“It was the mournful wail of an inmate down the corridor which still haunts me,” he said.

He even wrote a poem about it:

“The mournful wail echoed throughout the jail.

“The shrill sent a chill that stabbed like a nail.

“I want my babies and I want to go home.”

“I never saw her and knew neither her name nor her crime.

“But her piercing cry will haunt me a long time.”

Ka-Ching!

The grocery list: Sneed has learned when singer R. Kelly made bond in order to be released from Cook County Jail Saturday on child support payment arrears, he was also entitled to take with him $1,414.99 sent to him by fans for purchases from the jail commissary!

The donations came from a total of 29 people. Two people sent $5 each.

Hmm . . .

Sneed is told a car crash scene for an “Empire” episode, which was filmed in Paw Paw Woods Feb. 27, could signal the end to actor Jussie Smollett’s career on the series — if he is found guilty of faking his own racist, homophobic attack in Chicago on Jan. 29.

• Timeline: Smollett was just indicted by a grand jury Friday with 16 federal counts of disorderly conduct.

• Translation: “It’s true the Fox series requested to shoot scenes at Paw Paw Woods and Smollett was not there, when they filmed the scene after Smollett was charged,” a top source told Sneed. “They requested sheriff’s police support. They didn’t stay long, but they did film a crash scene.”

Could the car crash be the scene where Smollett’s character disappears if he doesn’t win his case?

Sneed tipped earlier the Fox series requested security and traffic-control assistance from Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart’s office when it filmed scenes for the crash episode at Paw Paw Woods.

“It just seemed beyond the pale this request would come on the heels of Smollett being charged yesterday,” said a spokesman for Dart’s office.

It’s anticipated mega L.A. attorney Mark Geragos, who once handled the Michael Jackson sexual abuse case years ago, is expected to represent Smollett at his hearing later this week.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Far from competitors tackling the frozen wilderness in Alaska’s Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a dozen people are holed up inside an Anchorage hotel behind banks of computers, tracking the punishing route and connecting with global fans seeking a real-time link to the off-the-grid sport.

ADVERTISING

As of Friday, 51 mushers are traveling long stretches between remote village checkpoints with no other company but the dogs pulling their sleds. But they’re not competing in a vacuum on the 1,000-mile trail that spans two mountain ranges and the frozen Yukon River before it heads up the wind-scrubbed Bering Sea Coast to the finish line in the Gold Rush town of Nome.

Their progress is monitored from several hotel rooms whose 24/7 occupants are the Iditarod’s electronic eyes and ears. Technology has increasingly made the 47-year-old race more immediate to fans and safer for competitors, said Chas St. George, acting CEO of the Iditarod Trail Committee, the race’s governing board.

“This is a really low-tech event when you look at it from that perspective, but high-tech research has always been a huge part of the race,” he said Wednesday during a tour of the Iditarod’s hotel command post.

This is where volunteers and race contractors monitor the dog teams through sleds equipped with GPS trackers that allow fans to follow them online in real time and organizers to ensure no one is missing. Some serve as aircraft dispatchers for a cadre of pilots who ferry supplies as well as mushers and dogs that drop out.

Others process live video streamed from checkpoints along the rugged trail, using satellite dishes. Some volunteers handle race-standing updates sent through equipment first tested last year, making it possible to activate a super-size hot spot in the most remote places with satellite connections.

Venezuela buckles under massive power, communications outage

CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela’s worst power and communications outage on Friday deepened a sense of isolation and decay, endangering hospital patients, forcing schools and businesses to close and cutting people off from their families, friends and the outside world. While electricity returned to some parts of Caracas nearly 24 hours after lights, phones and the internet stopped working, the blackout was another harsh blow to a country paralyzed by economic and political turmoil.

Many of the few shops that were open were only accepting cash because without electricity and the internet they couldn’t process debit card payments, a common method of doing transactions in Venezuela since hyperinflation transformed the bolivar into one of the world’s most worthless currencies.

“I’m desperate,” said Maria Isabel Garcia, a 39-year-old office worker who hadn’t been able to cook anything for her three young children. She had planned to buy empanadas but had no cash because the bank didn’t have any when she went there on Thursday.

Another Caracas resident who is diabetic was searching for ice to preserve his limited supply of insulin medication.

Venezuelans are accustomed to power cuts, but nothing like the one that hit during rush hour Thursday evening, sending thousands of people on long nighttime treks in the dark to their homes. It reached virtually every part of the oil-rich country of 31 million, which was once Latin America’s wealthiest but is now beset by shortages and hyperinflation projected by the International Monetary Fund to reach a staggering 10 million percent this year, compelling about one-tenth of its population to flee in recent years.

Chelsea Manning jailed for refusing to testify on WikiLeaks

ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, who served years in prison for leaking one of the largest troves of classified documents in U.S. history, was sent to jail Friday for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks.

U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton ordered Manning to jail for civil contempt of court after a brief hearing in federal court in Alexandria in which Manning confirmed she has no intention of testifying. She told the judge she “will accept whatever you bring upon me.”

Manning has said she objects to the secrecy of the grand jury process and already revealed everything she knows at her court-martial. She said prosecutors have granted her immunity for her testimony, which eliminates her ability to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

“I will not participate in a secret process that I morally object to, particularly one that has been used to entrap and persecute activists for protected political speech,” she said in a statement released after she was taken into custody.

The judge said she will remain jailed until she testifies or until the grand jury concludes its work.

Smollett indicted on 16 counts stemming from reported attack

Trump pays his respects to 23 killed by Alabama tornado

BEAUREGARD, Ala. — Head bowed, President Donald Trump paid respects Friday to the 23 people killed when a powerful tornado roared through a rural Alabama town, observing a moment of silence before white wooden crosses that stood in remembrance of each victim.

Trump and his wife, Melania, held hands as they paused in front of each of the markers erected near a church serving as a makeshift disaster relief center for survivors of Sunday’s twister.

Earlier, the president stood on a hill overlooking a debris field and surveyed mangled trees and other wreckage.

Trump flew by airplane to a military base on the Georgia-Alabama border and boarded a helicopter that provided him with an aerial tour of the region before he arrived in Beauregard, which bore the brunt of the storm.

“We saw things that you wouldn’t believe,” Trump said after visiting a section of town where tornado winds tore houses from their foundations and uprooted trees. Mangled metal siding, wood planks and piping lay strewn on the ground, along with remnants of everyday life: items of clothing, a sofa, a bottle of Lysol cleaner and a welcome mat encrusted with dirt.

Bill Shine resigns from White House communications post

WASHINGTON — Bill Shine, a former Fox News executive who took over as President Donald Trump’s communications director last summer, exited the White House on Friday, the latest person to step away from a job that has become a revolving door within the turbulent West Wing.

Shine will join the president’s Republican re-election campaign, the White House said in a laudatory statement that quoted Trump and other top White House officials.

When Shine joined the administration, he was viewed as an experienced hand whose television experience could help shape Trump’s message. But like others before him, Shine was forced to grapple with a president who preferred to run his own communications strategy via tweet. In recent weeks, Trump had expressed frustration that Shine had not done more to improve his press coverage, said two people close to the president who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The announcement took many in the West Wing by surprise, though there were signs of unrest lately. Shine did not join Trump on his high-stakes trip to Vietnam for a summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.

Still, Trump said in a statement: “We will miss him in the White House, but look forward to working together on the 2020 Presidential Campaign, where he will be totally involved.”

Court denies new trial in ‘Serial’ podcast murder case

ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Maryland’s highest court denied a new trial Friday for a man whose murder conviction was chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial.”

In a 4-3 opinion, the Court of Appeals agreed with a lower court that Adnan Syed’s legal counsel was deficient in failing to investigate an alibi witness, but it disagreed that the deficiency prejudiced the case. The court said Syed waived his ineffective counsel claim.

The court reversed a Court of Special Appeals’ judgment, sending the case back to that court with directions to reverse a Baltimore Circuit Court judgment granting a new trial.

Syed is serving a life sentence after he was convicted in 2000 of strangling 17-year-old Hae Min Lee and burying her body in a Baltimore park. More than a decade later, the popular “Serial” podcast brought Syed’s case to millions of listeners with its debut 2014 season. The show revealed little-known evidence and attracted millions of listeners, shattering podcast-streaming and downloading records.

In 2016, a lower court ordered a retrial for Syed on grounds that his attorney, Cristina Gutierrez, who died in 2004, didn’t contact an alibi witness and provided ineffective counsel. The state appealed. The special appeals court upheld the lower court’s ruling last year and the state appealed that decision, too.

US adds just 20K jobs; unemployment dips to 3.8 pct.

WASHINGTON — Hiring tumbled in February, with U.S. employers adding just 20,000 jobs, the smallest monthly gain in nearly a year and a half. The slowdown in hiring, though, might have been depressed by harsh winter weather and the partial shutdown of the government.

Last month’s weak gain came after employers had added a blockbuster 311,000 jobs in January, the most in nearly a year. And over the past three months, job growth has averaged a solid 186,000, enough to lower the unemployment rate over time.

Despite the tepid pace of hiring in February, the government’s monthly jobs report Friday included several positive signs that point to a still-sturdy employment market and economy: Average hourly pay last month rose 3.4 percent from a year earlier — the sharpest year-over-year increase in a decade. The unemployment rate also fell to 3.8 percent, near the lowest level in five decades, from 4 percent in January.

“The U.S. labor market is still in good shape,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial. “Slower job growth was expected after huge average gains of better than 250,000 over the preceding four months. Job growth should bounce back in March and through the rest of this year.”

Last month’s pullback in hiring does follow signs that U.S. economic growth is slowing because of a weaker global economy, a trade war between the United States and China and signs of caution among American consumers. Those factors have led many economists to forecast weaker growth in the first three months of this year.

Amazon lobbies to exempt employees from labor protections

OLYMPIA, Wash. — Many of Amazon’s Seattle-area employees would be exempt from new labor protections in a bill passed by the state Senate after lobbyists for the tech giant pushed to change a key threshold in the rules.

The protections would partially prohibit non-compete clauses — controversial agreements used by tech companies and others to block employees from going to work for competitors or launching rival startups.

Lawmakers say Amazon lobbied to have the income threshold set at a level that would likely exempt many workers in Seattle.

ADVERTISING

The effort came as the company has expanded its presence in the state capital, where its spending has tripled in recent years.

The bill passed the Washington state Senate Tuesday with the salary threshold of $100,000 sought by Amazon. Employees above the threshold would be exempted from the labor protection."

Jussie Smollett

The 'Empire' actor is facing the charges after it was alleged he filed a false police report when he claimed to be the victim of a homophobic and racist hate attack on January 29.

According to Variety, a Cook County grand jury handed Jussie the indictment on Friday (08.03.19), after the actor was previously charged with a single count for the alleged false filing, which carries the possibility of up to three years in prison.

Of the 16 new counts, eight charges involve false statements given to Officer Muhammed Baig, while the other eight are for a more detailed account given to Detective Kim Murray.

Jussie had told police he was assaulted at 2am by two men who shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him and put a noose around his neck. In the more detailed account, he claimed that he fought back, and that one of the attackers was white.

The indictment read: ""Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission there was no reasonable ground for believing that such an offense had been committed.""

And although he faces several charges, former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg says the number of counts won't have an effect on Jussie's sentence, should he be convicted.

Andrew told Variety magazine that the counts will run concurrently, so the sentencing range would still be one to three years in prison.

He added: ""I would still expect a period of probation, a psychological evaluation and restitution to cover costs of the investigation. I would still be surprised if he goes to prison.""

Jussie has denied the allegations against him, and his attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson recently said a ""thorough investigation"" into the claims is still ongoing.

They said: ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.

""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense."""

Television actor Jussie Smollett, arrested last month on a single charge of perpetrating a hate-crime hoax, has been newly indicted on 16 felony counts of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two strangers shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of US President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama “Empire,” was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as “redundant and vindictive,” adding that his client “adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

He also said that levelling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defence cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $35,000 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

NO FURTHER ARREST

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on Feb. 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week’s indictment “because it’s the same case,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett’s claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett’s story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor’s defence.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologized last month to the cast and crew on the set of “Empire” but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, “to distract from the internal investigation.”

“Empire” debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show’s current season.

The horrifying injuries suffered by male car crash survivors have been recreated in powerful pictures that show how wearing a seatbelt saved all of their lives.

Despite seatbelts being a potential life-saving necessity, many New Zealanders are still making the fatal error of not strapping themselves in.

Startling statistics show around 90 New Zealanders who die in car crashes every year weren't wearing a seatbelt at the time.

In a desperate bid to save lives, New Zealand Transport Agency have launched a poignant new image campaign using male victims of near-fatal collisions and the awful injuries they suffered.

Even though the severity of their injuries are clear to see, none of the survivors would be alive if they had not been wearing a seatbelt.

Men have been targeted specifically, as data shows they are more adverse to seatbelt safety than women.

In 2012, 11 women who died in road accidents in New Zealand weren't wearing a seatbelt, and in 2016 a further 28 unrestrained women suffered fatal injuries.

Dylam Chirnside (pictured) was T-boned by another vehicle as short distance away from his home in 2017

But for male fatalities, the figures are much higher.

In 2012, 46 unrestrained men died, and in 2016 a staggering 72 unrestrained males died from incidents on New Zealand roads.

Liam Bethell was struck by a truck in 2017, and despite breaking most of his ribs, three discs in his back and suffering a brain bleed, he survived.

He had comatose for 10 days, and thankfully came round just before his daughter was born.

If he hadn't been wearing a seatbelt it's unlikely he would still be alive.

Another survivor, Rick Haira had been driving across train tracks when his ute was clipped by a train in 2004.

He was unable to regain control of his vehicle as it spun around, and because he was wearing his seatbelt, he wasn't thrown from the car.

A third survivor, Dylam Chirnside, was T-boned by another vehicle a short distance away from his home in 2017.

He suffered a brain injury and broke one of the major bones that connects the head to the spine.

Despite his awful injuries, his seatbelt kept him alive and he's since made a full recovery.

Notably all the men who participated in the campaign exhibited a dark deep bruise where their seatbelt would've been.

A physical reminder they had made the right call to wear a seatbelt and survived because of it.

The campaign launched with a public call-out to find men who had survived car accidents thanks to wearing a seatbelt.

Hundreds responded, but 10 men were chosen and their injuries were recreated in graphic detail.

Special effects and make-up teams worked from personal pictures from the men, to make the wounds as accurate as possible.

Dr. Natasha McKay, an Emergency Medicine Specialist also helped with the campaign.

'A seatbelt really does leave a mark like this.

'They will save your life, but they will leave a mark to show how they've done it,' Dr McKay said.

The images are displayed on billboards near carparks of bars and pubs in towns around New Zealand.

A 2017 report by AA on non-seat belt fatalities and offences in New Zealand found up to 30 percent of car crash fatalities involved people not wearing a seatbelt.

Among these are the hoax of the Duke lacrosse-players and the UVA rape case. Such cases are fabricated and sensationalized in order to support the ideological claim of ""rape culture on campuses.""

Hoax hate crimes belong to a larger category of ideologically motivated hoaxes, meant to sway public opinion and impact policy and legislation. There are broadly three types of ideological hoaxes.

Second, there are academic hoaxes, which are ""studies"" based on fabricated data and cherry-picked samples designed to provide an ideological outcome. For example, there was a study that showed that gays die much earlier because people do not support calling two men in a romantic relationship a marriage.

The third type is the fake hate crime. They are meant to prove the existence of violent bigots who attack the heroic victims, such as Jussie Smollett, Mathew Shepherd, and Tyler Clementi. These function as morality tales, with a victim hero and a religious martyr who proves the existence of endemic hate and violence. At the center exists the brave innocent who suffered for all our sins. These, by eliciting pity, prove victimhood and the harms of homophobia, racism, and sexism.

Taken together these hoaxes represent a large-scale, coordinated campaign of misinformation and cultural lies.

Many academic hoaxes are clustered in sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) studies. These studies sway public opinion and serve as ""hard evidence"" or ""real science"" and are used to change policy and create legislation.

Exposed hoaxes do not often get much media attention. As Austin Ruse notes:

Fake science is more dangerous than fake news because it takes more than a 24-hour news cycle to debunk fake science. Fake science can take years to dislodge. Even then, it remains part of the ""common knowledge."" For one paper on homosexuality, it has taken five years for it to be retracted. The paper, cited by more than 100 other scholarly papers, has been withdrawn from Social Science and Medicine because its results could not be replicated. What's more, they found a serious error in coding of the data rendering the initial finding unproven.

Often, hoaxes work because the postmodern doctrine of intersectionality demands that the general public play a pick-up game of ""find the martyr."" Like all workable belief systems, or long cons, it works because there is just enough truth. For the postmodern social-justice position, truth does not matter. Intersectionality stands as complete moral relativism. Intersectional doctrine repeats the ideological proposition that there are two positions: victim and oppressor. In reality, there's a third position used to accrue power: the oppressor masquerading as victim. Basically, those occupying this third position publicly attack people at their psychological core by asserting:

1. Nothing you believe (have been told or taught or know or is common sense) is true. Brain scrub.

2. Everything you or your kind have achieved was taken by violence and exploitation from the rightful owners. Not agreeing means you are a bigoted hater. Bad person.

3. You are complicit in all historical crimes and reap the benefits from them. Guilty person.

4. There can be no dissent. We are the voice of the new God, and the sky is falling. Heed us now. Saved person complies.

5. We are right and will not trifle with your Western logic, ethics, or facts; literature; history. They are all the tools of exploitation and oppression that you have used to destroy us and others. In fact, we will not even be seen speaking to you. Isolated person.

Hoaxes are not isolated from one another and do not take place in a vacuum. Regarding the Jussie Smollett incident, the media declared, ""This is America 2019."" Both Cory Booker and Kamala Harris called the incident ""a modern day lynching."" The LGBT news and cultural magazine The Advocate explained Harris's and Booker's legislative intentions: ""The federal law they hope to amend, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, was signed into law by President Obama in 2009.""

The Advocate further noted: ""Booker spoke on the floor about the importance of the anti-lynching legislation and referenced actor Jussie Smollett, hours after the actor was on Good Morning America. The openly gay star was the victim of an alleged hate crime last month where a rope was put around his neck by two white men, according to local police reports.""

Cory Booker himself tweeted twice: ""The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe."" Before the vote, he tweeted: ""To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime — I urge you to pay attention.""

This bill added sexual and gender identity (the enforced claim that some women have a penis) to groups under hate crime law that incur enhanced mandatory penalties.

Intersectionality is easy — just pose as, say, speaking as an XYZ. We recognize it immediately when Ellen Page vents her oppressed spleen on national TV. On The Late Show with Colbert, Page shrieked, ""Kids are going to be abused, and they're going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street.""

Really?

Over 300 politically motivated hate crime hoaxes predate ""Trump's America,"" that anti-Narnia, Mad-Max violent landscape where church fish fries serve as covers for cross-burnings and where brutal homophobic attacks are mapped out.

If you thought Ellen Page sounded unhinged, imagine the LGBT activist who set fire to her own home and burned two of her German Shepherds alive, along with three cats, because she was upset that the Pride Parade did not bring out enough hate groups to protest.

The fabrications need to be reinforced and enshrined in the public imagination and consciousness. Truth no longer matters. In an exhaustive study of Mathew Shepard, The Book of Matt: Hidden Truths about the Murder of Matthew Shepard, journalist Stephen Jimenez shows that Shepard socialized with the killers and that all three parties to Shepard's murder were involved in, among other things, the sale of crystal meth.

Recently, amid much publicity and fanfare, Shepard was reinterred at the National Cathedral, a new heroic martyr. This widespread deception by trusted institutions and legislation erodes people's basic civil rights, reduces religion to ""hate doctrine,"" and quells free speech.

This activism is about ideological conformity or isolation. Identity is authoritarian, a new form of totalitarianism masquerading as ""civil rights."" It has gutted the academy and turned the press in the public's eye into a pack of hucksters who can't be trusted.

Intersectionality rates victim against oppressor as a template for good versus evil.

I have little doubt that if the police had found some poor homeless white men, Smollett would have identified them as his attackers. This is a man who campaigned for Kamala Harris and who knows Cory Booker. Smollett is a 36-year-old wealthy man, a celebrity. If he had been given the chance, he would have sent innocent people to prison — and who would have done so with support of the media and elected representatives.

This is America 2019.

Don Babwin, The Associated Press





CHICAGO -- A grand jury in Chicago indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment -- eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective -- comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

""The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what's called a probable cause proceeding.I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,"" Geragos told NBC's ""Access"" after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on Feb. 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive than the first because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was white. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was charged last month. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers he paid $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective that one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck -- a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett's bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had ""no reasonable ground that such an offence had been committed.""

Since Smollett's arrest, the producers of ""Empire"" announced that the actor's character would be removed from the season's final two episodes."

Such charges have never before been filed on a ""victim of a hate crime,"" attorney Mark Geragos told anchor Anderson Cooper on CNN's ""AC360.""

“What is happening here is, frankly, a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions,"" Geragos said. ""And that’s the reason I got into this.

""It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty."" — Mark Geragos, attorney for Jussie Smollett

The indictment released Friday details Smollett’s disorderly conduct charges for allegedly fabricating a hate crime in late January in Chicago.

Geragos slammed Chicago investigators, who he insisted did not speak to anyone at 20th Century Fox or from the ""Empire"" television series over Smollett’s supposed salary frustrations. The network had no comment Friday.

The lawyer also slammed the Chicago Police Department over alleged leaks to the media, saying “all of the information that was being leaked was false.”

When Smollett's account of the attack first emerged, he had many defenders in Hollywood, the media, and among Democrats seeking the presidency in 2020, including U.S. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, both of whom called the alleged attack a “modern-day lynching,” before Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson went public with his investigators’ findings.

Smollett has reportedly been written off the final two episodes of the current season of “Empire.” It was unclear whether he will return next season."

Hollywood films on racism Spike Lee's critical statement: 'Da 5 Bloods' Spike Lee has long made films critical of racist structures in the US. Pictured here is a still from his upcoming new film, ""Da 5 Bloods."" Lee had his directorial debut in the mid-1980s. Through films like his 1989 comedy-drama ""Do the Right Thing,"" he became known for taking up serious topics, like inequality, with a touch of levity.

Hollywood films on racism A history lesson on racism in the US: 'Selma' In 2014, African-American director Ava DuVernay depicted a high-point in the civil rights movement in 1965, when she traced the march of civil rights activists and others across Alabama between the cities Selma and Montgomery. The film was the subject of controversy in Hollywood; some speculated it had been passed over at the Oscars because actors had stood up for the rights of black Americans.

Hollywood films on racism Controversy over Oscar-winning 'Green Book' Peter Farrelly's ""Green Book"" won many awards, including the Oscar for Best Picture in 2019. But the story of a white chauffeur (Viggo Mortensen, l.) and a black pianist (Mahershala Ali), based on true events, was considered by critics to fit too easily into the ""white savior"" narrative and did not delve into the pain of racism against African Americans in the US deeply enough.

Hollywood films on racism Best film in 2017: 'Moonlight' ""Moonlight,"" directed by Barry Jenkins, tells the story of an Afro-American homosexual man in three chapters. Convincing in its aesthetics, ""Moonlight"" is an example of a cinematic work that differentiates and subtly translates its theme without melodrama or sentimentality.

Hollywood films on racism Original and surprising 'Get Out' One of the most idiosyncratic contributions to the subject of racism in cinema is ""Get Out"" of 2017. Unlike many well-intentioned but sentimental Hollywood films, African-American director Jordan Peele focused on genres, depicting racism with elements of horror and comedy — an extremely original and convincing genre mix.

Hollywood films on racism Expressive cinema: '12 Years a Slave' ""12 Years a Slave,"" which opened in cinemas in 2013 and won the Oscar for best film the following year, takes a deep look back into the origins of slavery in the US. British director Steve McQueen staged the racist drama with prominent actors — thus winning over the Oscars' Academy.

Hollywood films on racism An audience magnet: 'Black Panther' Finally, another film that garnered an Oscar can be linked with the subject of racism, in a broad sense. The 2018 Marvel film ""Black Panther"" focused for the first time on a black superhero. Marvel Comics creaters Stan Lee and Jack Kirby invented the story characters in the 1960s at the height of the civil rights movement.

Hollywood films on racism Sensitive approach: 'Loving' In 2016, US director Jeff Nichols surprised audiences with the sensitive drama ""Loving,"" another film that deals with a historical chapter of North American racism. It depicts the struggle of a couple who rebel against the law of forbidden mixed marriages — and succeed in court.

Hollywood films on racism A loaded romance: 'Queen & Slim' In 2019 Greek-American director Melina Matsoukas debuted with ""Queen & Slim,"" a variation on ""Bonnie & Clyde."" Set in today's United States, a young black couple seeks refuge after the main character kills a cop in self-defense on their first date. Melina rose to fame for directing music videos for Rihanna and Beyoncé, among others.

Hollywood films on racism Authentic cinema by John Cassavetes: 'Shadows' Like Melina Matsoukas, John Cassavetes was also a white US director with Greek ancestry. His debut film, ""Shadows"" (1959), tells with great sensitivity the story of three African-American siblings in the New York music scene. At the time, few other directors in the US had come close to authentically portraying life in this artistic circle.

Hollywood films on racism A look back: '12 Angry Men' The 1957 film ""12 Angry Men"" was one of the first works of US cinema to deal with racism. Primarily a legal thriller, the film debut by director Sidney Lumet was about the prejudices of 12 white jurors in court, who are supposed to issue a verdict on a young Puerto Rican.

Hollywood films on racism Sidney Poitier in 'In the Heat of the Night' In the 1960s the subject of racism gained a foothold in mainstream cinema. In the drama ""In the Heat of the Night,"" Poitier plays a policeman from the North who has to solve a case down South. There, he is confronted with unfathomable racism. The film was awarded five Oscars — and Poitier became the first African-American superstar of US cinema.

Hollywood films on racism Taboo-breaker: 'Mississippi Burning' ""Mississippi Burning,"" the 1988 film by Briton Alan Parker, tells of the disappearance of three civil rights activists and the ensuing FBI investigation. One critic wrote: ""Parker's gimmicky directing (does) pretty much everything to turn 'Mississippi Burning' into a gangster movie rip-off. Yet the film breaks a taboo: it places a whole group of the white American middle-class in the wrong.""

Hollywood films on racism A new generation: 'Boyz n the Hood' African-American director John Singleton made headlines with his first film in 1991, which he directed at age 24. ""Boyz n the Hood"" is considered groundbreaking for its authentic portrayal of the lives of the black population in an impoverished district of a major US city. He was the first black person, as well as the youngest person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director.

Hollywood films on racism Racism outside of the US: 'Invictus' White Hollywood stars often portray racism as something that happens outside of the USA. In the sports drama ""Invictus,"" Clint Eastwood tells the sensational story of the South African national rugby team in the years after apartheid was abolished. Morgan Freeman played the role of freedom-fighter Nelson Mandela.

Hollywood films on racism Documentary inspiration: 'I Am Not Your Negro' Apart from the many feature films that American cinema has contributed to the subject of racism in recent decades, there are also documentaries. ""I Am Not Your Negro"" by Haitian director Raoul Peck of 2016 was very convincing. Peck relied heavily on texts by African-American writer James Baldwin. Author: Jochen Kürten (als)



Smollett denies allegations

Smollett has denied all allegations against him, and in a statement, his attorney Mark Geragos denounced what he called ""prosecutorial overkill.""

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" Geragos said.

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,"" Geragos said.

Detectives initially became suspicious about Smollett's story after speaking to two suspects — two brothers who are also black — who said Smollett had paid them $3,500 (€3,088) to carry out the attack.

Smollett's 'Empire' character cut from episodes

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged.

Johnson said Smollett also sent a threatening racist and homophobic letter to himself at the Twentieth Century Fox studio before the attack.

Since the allegations came out, the producers of ""Empire"" announced that the actor's character would be removed from the season's final two episodes.

We're told Smollett's star actually skyrocketed right after the alleged attack was initially reported. Our sources say he was getting hit up nonstop for movies, TV gigs, commercials and, of course, interviews and appearances.

When his story went off the rails and he was arrested and charged with a felony for filing a false police report ... the well ran dry. We're told Smollett's getting zero calls for new work, and is being treated like a pariah.

Makes sense. Hollywood's waiting to see how his case plays out, but the 16-count indictment the grand jury handed up Friday can't help.

As we reported ... ""Empire"" also removed Jussie's character from the final 2 episodes of the season in order to keep peace on the set ... where some of his co-stars are butting heads over whether to support him.

US actor Jussie Smollett has been charged by a grand jury in Chicago on 16 counts, accused of making a false report to police that he was the victim of a hate crime.

Smollett had previously appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting $100,000 (£76,000) bail.

The 36-year-old actor had told police he had been attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

Officers later said that he staged the attack in an attempt to further his acting career.

Smollett, who stars in Empire, was last month suspended from the TV show following the charge.

He had reportedly apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence.

Smollett told police in late January that he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2am.

The actor said the men shouted at him, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an ""unknown substance"" on him.

Police said Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in ""MAGA country"".

After an investigation, Chicago police said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show.

A lawyer for the actor called the grand jury indictment ""vindictive"" and ""prosecutorial overkill"".

In a statement, Mark Geragos said: ""(The indictment) is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy."""

A grand jury has indicted actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts after he was accused of faking a hate crime attack.

Smollett claimed in January that he was the victim of a homophobic and racist attack, but Chicago police have accused him of perpetrating the attack on himself.

A grand jury in Cook County, Chicago indicted the Empire actor with 16 counts of disorderly conduct on Friday (March 8) for filing false police reports.

The counts relate to interviews Smollett gave to two police officers after the incident on January 29.

Jussie Smollett lawyers say 16-count indictment is ‘overkill’

Smollett continues to maintain his innocence.

In a statement, his lawyer Mark Geragos said that filing 16 separate counts over the incident, which could lead to prison time if convicted, was “prosecutorial overkill.”

The statement also noted that Chicago police this week opened an internal leak probe relating to the leaking of “inaccurate” information about the case.

Geragos said: “This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Police open leak inquiry into Jussie Smollett case

Chicago Police Department confirmed on Thursday (March 7) that the department was looking into leaks related to the case.

Sergeant Rocco Alioto told CNN: “I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation.

“As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.”

Smollett has consistently denied any involvement in orchestrating the attack against himself.

The actor, who is currently on bail, was suspended from Empire in February over the case, with his character written out of the last two episodes of the show’s current season..

Empire‘s producers said in a statement: “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us.

“Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”"

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" He said Smollett ""adamantly maintains his innocence.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,"" Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett's account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett's bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had ""no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.""

Since Smollett's arrest, the producers of ""Empire"" announced that the actor's character would be removed from the season's final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces ""Empire"" had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

Now, a grand jury has now charged him with 16 counts of disorderly conduct. Smollett denies all the charges against him and is due to appear in court on 16th March.

The actor’s lawyers have described him as a “young man of impeccable character” and said they’ll “mount an aggressive defence” of their client.

In January, Smollett claimed two men had tied a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him while hurling racial insults as he went out late in the evening to buy food from a chain of Subway in Chicago. Later in the month, he detailed the events of the night to fans while on stage at a concert.

Two men were arrested over the incident but later released without charged and Smollett was arrested after it was alleged he’d paid them – with police claiming they have a cheque that showed the actor paid them $3,500.

In a press conference, Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said they believed Smollett staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on Empire.

He said: “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

Following the hoax allegations, Smollett was removed from the final two episodes of the current season of Empire.

An official statement from Fox read: “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season.”

President Trump also waded into the debate surrounding Smollett and accused him of making “racist and dangerous comments.”"

Instead, the 36-year-old actor — who is black and gay — has been dropped from the last two episodes of the show’s current season, and his future is now in the hands of the court.

Smollett was charged last month with one felony count of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

He allegedly sent himself a threatening letter and then hired two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

According to court documents published online by local media, the 16-count indictment lists the specific statutes Smollett violated by telling police he had been attacked when he knew “there was no reasonable ground for believing” that such crimes had occurred.

Smollett has denied the allegations against him and in a statement to the media, his attorney Mark Geragos decried what he called “prosecutorial overkill.”

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Geragos said.

The case has drawn intense national interest with everyone from politicians to celebrities and late night talk show hosts commenting.

When asked about the indictment, a Fox spokesman declined to comment.

Smollett was released on bond in February. He is next due back in court on March 14

President Donald Trump's promise to issue an executive order guaranteeing free speech on campus was typically vague. Still, it is worth thinking through the actual threats to free speech. The biggest culprits, in general, are those with a vested interest in fomenting controversy: sometimes students or university staff but also outside shills working for fun or profit. It is hard to see how a presidential order would address such actors.

First, there is a distinction between private institutions and public ones. (The president said colleges and universities would have to abide by his order “if they want federal research dollars,” but both almost always receive federal funds.) Professors at state schools, as public sector employees, already enjoy formal free speech rights. That is my situation as a professor at George Mason University, a state school in northern Virginia.

Nonetheless, being at a state school is hardly a guarantee of tolerance. Teaching at a state university does widen the scope of what a professor can say without being fired. But ongoing student protests or unfavorable treatment from colleagues can make continued employment so unpleasant that a person simply decides to leave. In my experience, most professors aren't in it for the money - rather, they love their work. Loving your work is a gift that can be taken away rather easily, regardless of whatever formal legal protections there may be.

Or consider the position of a student. You might have the legal right to start a pro-Trump group on campus. But you might be dissuaded from doing so if you fear your professors would respond by writing you mediocre letters of recommendation.

What really matters on campus is what the most obstreperous participants in these debates consider to be acceptable behavior and speech and how far they will take their protests. These individuals are usually those with relatively little to lose from strident behavior - and perhaps some local status to gain. They may be students, or they may not; they can be student counselors, or faculty members, or even low-level university bureaucrats.

UC Berkeley is a state school, but critics have charged that Berkeley is not especially hospitable to free and unrestricted speech. Indeed, there have been a number of well-known incidents on the Berkeley campus, including attacks on visiting conservative speakers. They illustrate how a so-called heckler's veto can override any right to free speech enshrined in law.

Trump's own cause célèbre is Hayden Williams, who was assaulted for defending Trump and criticizing Jussie Smollett. Williams was on the Berkeley campus when the incident happened, but neither he nor the man arrested for punching him is a member of the university community. Berkeley presents unique challenges when it comes to free speech, because the nearby community has so many resident agitators ready to join a protest whenever things on campus get insufficiently politically correct.

The relevant troublemakers are hardly ever university administrators. Yet they would inevitably become entangled in any tighter federal free speech regulations. I have found such administrators to be pragmatic and able to see multiple sides of an issue, even if I do not always agree with their stances. Their primary goal is usually to get the rancor and protests to go away, so the business of the university can return to normal. Placing more constraints on their behavior could actually weaken their hand - by limiting their ability to mollify unruly student groups, for instance.

The main correct criticism of university leaders is straightforward: Too often, they do not have the courage to defend free speech. I would suggest, however, that they are more or less rational agents, making concessions to the forces of political correctness because their jobs demand it. They serve up weak, apologetic responses because they fear something worse - escalating protests or further incidents. I think it unlikely that any federal law will strengthen their resolve. It is always possible to find concessions along some dimension or another.

My own university, George Mason, has received a top free speech rating from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. I am impressed by the university leadership, but I also realize that the students deserve some credit. George Mason is set in a strongly suburban, centrist community, and the student body has a high proportion of immigrants, children of immigrants and those who don't take wealth or privilege for granted. They are hoping their degrees will give them better jobs and lives. They are not, on the whole, natural candidates to become social justice warriors, at least as that notion is defined in contemporary U.S. politics.

I'm all for free speech, whether for public or private schools. But the fight has to be won in the hearts and minds of students and workers, not by the federal government.

Trump's communications chief resigns

WASHINGTON -- Bill Shine, a former Fox News executive who took over as President Donald Trump's communications director last summer, exited the White House on Friday.

Shine will join the president's Republican re-election campaign, the White House said.

When Shine joined the administration, he was viewed as an experienced hand whose television experience could help shape Trump's message. But the president has preferred to run his own communications strategy via tweet. In recent weeks, Trump had expressed frustration that Shine had not done more to improve his press coverage, said two people close to the president who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The announcement took many in the West Wing by surprise, though there were signs of unrest lately. Shine did not join Trump on his trip to Vietnam for a summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

Shine called his eight-month stint in the White House ""the most rewarding experience of my entire life.""

Medicaid OK'd to pay for sex change

The Iowa Supreme Court on Friday upheld a lower court's ruling that the state cannot deny two transgender women Medicaid coverage for sex-reassignment surgery.

The state's high court agreed with Judge Arthur Gamble's ruling in June that a 1995 Iowa Department of Human Services policy denying Medicaid coverage for sex-reassignment surgery violates the state's 2007 Civil Rights Act, which added gender identity to the state's list of protected classes.

Gamble also deemed state's 1995 policy unconstitutional, but the high court did not address that finding.

Friday's ruling comes in the consolidated cases of Carol Ann Beal, 43, who lives in northwestern Iowa, and EerieAnna Good, 29, who lives in the east of the state. Both were born male but have identified as female since childhood. They sought to have surgery under the state's Medicaid program, which provides care for the poor and disabled, but were denied. They appealed to the state agency, which oversees the program, and were again denied.

They sued in 2017, and the agency appealed after Gamble's ruling, saying gender-reassignment surgery is performed ""primarily for psychological purposes"" and is the same as cosmetic or reconstructive surgeries that are excluded from coverage.

The state Supreme Court said that the record doesn't support that assertion.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, which filed the lawsuit on the behalf of Beal and Good, called Friday's ruling ""a landmark win.""

400 Houston firefighters face layoffs

HOUSTON -- City officials say Mayor Sylvester Turner in the coming weeks intends to lay off up to 400 firefighters so that he can then implement a pay-parity measure.

Members of the Houston City Council said Turner plans to impose the layoffs to pay for raises for other firefighters, who are entitled to the same pay as police of a corresponding rank under a measure city voters approved last year.

Council members told the Houston Chronicle the mayor intends to soon send the layoff notices, which would come as city leaders are grappling with how to close a $197 million budget deficit.

Police said Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

After an investigation, Chicago police said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show.

Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

A lawyer for the actor called the grand jury indictment “vindictive” and “prosecutorial overkill”.

In a statement, Mark Geragos said: “(The indictment) is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy.”

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama “Empire,” was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as “redundant and vindictive,” adding that his client “adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

He also said that leveling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defense cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $35,000 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

NO FURTHER ARREST

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on Feb. 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week’s indictment “because it’s the same case,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett’s claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett’s story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor’s defense.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologized last month to the cast and crew on the set of “Empire” but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, “to distract from the internal investigation.”

“Empire” debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show’s current season.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

SMOLLETT MAINTAINS INNOCENCE

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on 20 February is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3 500 to carry out the staged attack.

Uber is one of a growing number “peer-to-peer” networks touted as a way to save you money, but there’s a lingering question about what these services mean for user rights and privacy.

What seems like booking a low-cost Uber ride from a friendly driver is actually (meaning: mostly) an exchange between you and a massive corporate entity that cooperates frequently with law enforcement.

Recently, the case involving Jussie Smollett shed new light on the issue. The star of the show “Empire” allegedly hired two brothers to stage an attack on him, and the Chicago Police used surveillance cameras and, more importantly, tracked their Uber ride using credit card records. In fact, it was the Uber purchase that ultimately revealed their identities.

That’s more common than you might think, says attorney Abbas Kazerounian.

CHICAGO'S VAST CAMERA NETWORK HELPED SOLVE JUSSIE SMOLLETT CASE

“Uber's records are frequently used in criminal cases,” he told Fox News. “In the last six months of 2015, Uber received 415 data requests from various U.S. law enforcement agencies, and almost all of those requests pertained to criminal investigations, such as cases of fraud, theft, or assault. Throughout this six-month time period, only 28 requests for data were from court orders.”

“Technology comes with its own form of fascism,” adds analyst Roger Kay. “The sharing economy is not at all grey. It's a large organization held together by technology, which is quite an exacting master. It's always official. When you book with Lyft or Uber, that record becomes part of a huge database that manages all the resources and handles billing.”

It’s an interesting dilemma. In many ways, you give up your privacy in order to share your data with a massive corporation worth billions (be it Uber, Facebook, or Google). Jumping on a subway or taking the bus (or even using a taxi) does not require quite the same compromise, especially if you pay with cash. With Uber or Lyft, you’re sharing your exact route at all times, in addition to your credit card details, home address, phone number, and more.

“Pretty much everything we do these days is recorded,” says consumer analyst Rob Enderle. “If this was just peer-to-peer, then finding the Uber driver to question would have been a serious problem. It used to be with cabs you needed to know the name of the cab company and likely even the division so you could run down the record. Now all of this is centralized and you can often backtrack through the credit card transaction to the more detailed records.”

APP STALKERS, ROBOCALL DEFENSES AND MORE: TECH Q&A

“You could argue that Jussie Smollett's arrest was due as much to his own ignorance as it was to a top-notch police investigation,” adds IT analyst Charles King. Indeed, Kazerounian notes that Chicago has the highest number of security cameras of any U.S. city (about 32,000).

Uber declined to comment when contacted by Fox News. In a 2017 blog post, however, the company argues that tech can play an ethical role in both privacy and public safety.

King told Fox News that technology is now so pervasive that many crimes are now traceable.

The burning question, though, is whether non-criminals are happy with this arrangement.

YOUR APPS MAY BE FOLLOWING YOUR EVERY MOVE

Take Craigslist, for example. It’s a vast peer-to-peer network, but once you share your phone number and email address, it becomes a treasure trove for telemarketers. You purchase a couch or a used car from a neighbor, but there’s always a middle-man.

“Consumers need to be careful not to share personally identifiable information when using person-to-person platforms because even if the person you are interacting with is legitimate, there is a chance that sharing personal information might be displayed on the internet where an illegitimate party might use the information for nefarious purposes,” says Kazerounian.

It’s not just Uber. The phone in your pocket is also tracking your whereabouts, sometimes without your permission based on when and where you attach to a Wi-Fi network. The data is saved forever, and Kazerounian explained that Uber records are used in marital disputes, to prove adulterous affairs, and to show that one party has enough income to pay alimony.

Police say Smollett - who gained fame on Fox musical drama ""Empire"" - staged the attack in a bid to gain publicity and a bigger paycheck.

Instead, the 36-year-old actor - who is black and gay - has been dropped from the last two episodes of the show's current season, and his future is now in the hands of the court.

Smollett was charged last month with one felony count of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

He allegedly sent himself a threatening letter and then hired two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

'Prosecutorial overkill'

According to court documents published online by local media, the 16-count indictment lists the specific statutes Smollett violated by telling police he had been attacked when he knew ""there was no reasonable ground for believing"" that such crimes had occurred.

Smollett has denied the allegations against him and in a statement to the media, his attorney Mark Geragos decried what he called ""prosecutorial overkill.""

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" Geragos said.

The case has drawn intense national interest with everyone from politicians to celebrities and late night talk show hosts commenting.

When asked about the indictment, a Fox spokesman declined to comment.

Smollett was released on bond in February. He is next due back in court on March 14.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment – eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective – comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" He said Smollett ""adamantly maintains his innocence.""

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett's account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck – a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett's bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment by the Cook County grand jury in Chicago on Thursday, and made public on Friday, gave details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett.

The 36-year-old actor, who is openly gay, was arrested and charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint, on accusation that he falsely reported he was attacked on January 29 by two strangers who hurled racial and homophobic slurs, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts - eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett, who plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama Empire, staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

Smollett's lawyer, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as ""redundant and vindictive"", adding that his client ""adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption"".

He also said that levelling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defence cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

'Racial bias'

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on February 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14.

In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week's indictment ""because it's the same case"", Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters news agency.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reports said that there were doubts about Smollett's account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating the alleged leaks.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

In an interview with ABC's Good Morning America days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His lawyers said after his arrest on February 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor's defence.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologised last month to the cast and crew on the set of Empire but maintained his innocence.

The charges stem from a January 29 incident where Smollett, 36, had claimed that he was attacked by two men while leaving a restaurant in Chicago.

The actor, who is openly gay, alleged that the suspects, one of whom was wearing a red Make America Great Again hat, shouted racial and homophobic slurs before they attacked him.

After an investigation, the authorities said Smollett falsely reported to the police that he had been attacked by two men.

The actor was previously charged in a criminal complaint with felony disorderly conduct, involving lying to police. The crime carries a felony charge, and if Smollett is found guilty he could face up to three years in prison and up to USD 25,000 in fines.

According to Variety, a Cook County grand jury returned a more thorough indictment on Friday.

Eight of the charges involve false statements given to Officer Muhammed Baig, while the other eight pertain to a more detailed account given to Detective Kim Murray.

""Jussie Smollett knew that at the time... there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,"" stated the indictment.

Police believes that Smollett had paid the two suspect, Ola and Abel Osundairo, USD 3,500 to stage the attack.

Smollett's potential role in the alleged attack emerged after reports stated that he was not cooperating with the police.

In segments that aired Wednesday, Kelly whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will — likely hoping the raw interview would help sway public opinion.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a “sex cult.”

Experts said Kelly’s appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That’s why most defence attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

“In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defence,” said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. “I would document every word they said … (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.”

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but “historically it’s a bad idea,” Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors allege.

In Kelly’s case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

“A lot of the public already thinks he’s guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,” Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, “this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary” to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defence, Thiagarajah said, adding: “He may not know all the evidence against him.”

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she’s 14.

Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not “knowingly” have sex with underage girls.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview — but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and “stick to a script.”

“If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,” he said.

On Wednesday’s broadcast, Kelly’s emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a “big heart” who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, “I didn’t do this stuff! This is not me!” He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, “I’m fighting for my (expletive) life.”

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was “not about music.”

“I’m trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can’t do it” because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. “You all just don’t want to believe it.”

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing “expecting to leave. He didn’t come here to go to jail,” said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defence attorney said at the time that Kelly’s finances were “a mess.”

After Wednesday’s hearing, the publicist said that the singer “feels good” about the TV interview.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly — Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary — also are set to air. Savage’s parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day.

“At no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,” attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done “lots of things wrong” when it comes to women, but he said he had apologized. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centred on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Rising from poverty on Chicago’s South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, “12 Play,” which produced such popular sex-themed songs as “Your Body’s Callin'” and “Bump N’ Grind.” He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is “I Believe I Can Fly.”

A grand jury returned 16 felony counts against ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett on Thursday.

News of the indictments emerged on Friday afternoon. The Cook County State Attorney's Office confirmed the indictment to several outlets, including WABC-TV and WBBM-TV in Chicago.

In February, Smollett was initially charged with one felony count for filing a false police report for staging a homophobic, racist attack against himself.

Smollett claimed that when he was attacked in January, two men put a noose around his neck, chanted slogans linked to President Donald Trump, poured an unknown substance on him, and used racist and homophobic slurs.

But police now believe that Smollett orchestrated the attack, hiring two men to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his salary on ""Empire,"" they said in a press conference last month. Smollett has been accused of paying two brothers, who were previously consider suspects, $3,500 to take part in the attack.

According to WABC, the jury has handed down two sets of charges. The first pertains to the claims the detailed claims the actor made about the alleged attack. The second set is related to an interview Smollett had with police later on the day that he filed the report.

Earlier on Friday, the Chicago Police Department said that it is investigating its own officers over reports that they leaked information about the Smollett case.

In February, Smollett's lawyers said that he maintains his innocence and called him a man of ""impeccable character and integrity,"" the Associated Press reported. He will appear in court on March 14.

Share Tweet By: AP

CHICAGO — “Empire” actor and R&B singer Jussie Smollett told Chicago police in January that two men physically attacked him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 22

— Smollett receives a racist and homophobic threatening letter at the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed. Police later say that they believe Smollett sent the letter himself.

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

Feb. 19

— Chicago police investigate tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided. Foxx later says the reason for the recusal is that she had conversations with a Smollett family member after the incident was reported in late January.

Feb. 20

— Chicago police say Smollett is officially suspected of filing a false police report when he said he was a victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago in January. Police also say that two brothers who were questioned about the attack were testifying before a grand jury and detectives were presenting evidence to the grand jury.

— Chicago police say the Cook County State’s Attorney has charged Smollett with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report that he was attacked by two masked men. Police detectives were contacting Smollett’s attorneys to arrange his surrender for arrest.

Feb. 21

— Chicago police say Smollett turned himself in to face a felony charge of disorderly conduct, which could bring up to three years in prison.

— Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett staged a racist and homophobic attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted publicity. Investigators say they have a $3,500 check that Smollett used to pay the two brothers to help him.

Feb. 22

— Producers of “Empire” say Jussie Smollett’s character will be removed from the final two episodes of this season.

March 8

—A Cook County grand jury returns a 16-count indictment charging Smollett with falsely reporting an offense."

Donald Trump was greeted with a rapturous applause at an Alabama church on Friday, but the disaster-stricken crowd received more than just good wishes from the president.

Hoping to offer comfort in the wake of the deadly tornado that swept through the region last weekend, many of the hundred-strong congregation received a unique piece of memorabilia: a Trump-signed Bible.

Though the practice of a book-signing is usually reserved only to its author, Trump kindly obliged a 12-year-old boy's request to sign his copy of the religious scripture.

And the gesture prompted a frenzy at the Providence Baptist Church, in Opelika, as many of the cheering crowd began waving their Bibles in the air too, hoping to have it branded with Trump's distinctive, frenetic signature.

President Trump appeared at the Providence Baptist Church, in Opelika, on Friday. Bearing words of support and sympathy he also offered a unique range of memorabilia: signed Bibles

After signing one 12-year-old boy's religious text, a frenzy ensued among the crowd with several others vying to have their Bibles branded with Trump's distinctive, frenetic signature

The pair were warmly received during their stop in the state, which supported Trump with 62. 1 percent of the vote in his successful 2016 election

A variety of Bibles, caps and other items were handed to the President by supporters hoping to have it branded with his distinctive, frenetic signature

'I enjoyed him coming,' church volunteer Ada Ingram said. 'I think it's a godsend'.

Another volunteer, Emily Pike, said the president and first lady Melania Trump signed her 10-year-old daughter’s Bible, which was decorated with pink camouflage.

'She just reached out there and said, ‘Mr. President, would you sign this?’' Pike told the Associated Press.

Though members of the denomination seemed delighted with their autographed texts, the internet's reaction provided a stark contrast.

Many accused Trump of being a hypocrite, claiming his political policies are a perfect contradiction to the religious teachings he was writing over.

Others berated the perceived arrogance of his gesture, accusing the President of touting the religious book as if it was of his own workings.

'I seriously cannot imagine the absolute outrage and round-the-clock coverage this would've earned if President Obama went around signing Bibles. My God,' said author Jennifer Hayden.

Others too waded in with their outrage, insisted Trump's predecessor would've been treated differently

But among the litany of fervor, some Tweeters couldn't resist poking fun at the president.

'In Trump's defense, he wrote as much of the Bible as Art of the Deal,' jibed journalist Judd Legum.

'People don't understand the purpose of Trump signing Bibles,' teased another commentor. 'May people are without a way to prepare food after a disaster. When Trump signs a Bible, its bursts in flame and people can cook over it.'

And the 45th US President's alleged personal affairs weren't immune from ironic ridicule either.

'He signed Bibles with the same hand he used -- as president -- to sign hush money checks to an adult filmstar,' said former Chief of Staff to Joe Biden, Ron Klain.

'Trump's favorite story of the Bible is the part where Jesus pays $130,000 to keep Mary Magdalene quiet,' added author Sarah Cooper.

It wasn't long before the outrage was interjected by a series of tweets picking fun at the president

The U.S. president also posed for selfies and signed hats and a $100 dollar bill that a volunteer passed him at the Baptist church.

He and first lady Melania Trump spent the afternoon consoling families who lost their homes in a deadly F4 tornado that killed 23 people in Alabama on Sunday.

The pair were warmly received during their stop in the state, which supported Trump with 62. 1 percent of the vote in his successful 2016 election.

'I've never seen anything like it,' the president said of the devastation. 'We love you all. We love the state of Alabama.'

Outside the church the first couple honored the dead, holding a moment of silence as they stood hand-in-hand before a memorial made of crosses representing the victims of last weekend's storms.

The Trumps were visiting Alabama on their way to Florida, where they are spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago and raising money for the president's reelection campaign.

Donald and Melania Trump arrived in Alabama early Friday afternoon via helicopter after landing in Air Force One in nearby Georgia. Their aerial tour lasted approximately 25 minutes, and afterward, the president told victims that federal emergency managers will stay as long as they need to.

'It’s hard to believe actually,' he told reporters during a walking tour of the devastation. 'We saw things you wouldn’t believe.'

He said that FEMA had done an 'A plus job' managing recovery efforts so far.

Tornadoes blitzed Alabama last weekend, killing 23 people, and ransacking parts of Georgia, where the Trumps first landed.

Greeting them on the tarmac was the state's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, and Sen. Doug Jones, a Democrat, greeted the president at the Auburn airfield and accompanied them on a walking tour of the community most-heavily affected.

'The governor has done an incredible job,' the president told reporters amid his tour of Beauregard, the Alabama neighborhood hit hardest.

Ivey told the president 'we’re stronger together' and thanked him for him for taking the time to visit.

He told reporters as he left the White House on Friday, 'I'll be meeting with Governor Ivey. The people of Alabama, they got hit very hard by the tornadoes.

'We're stopping there, then we're going to Florida. And we're going to do a lot of work. We'll be working very hard,' he said.

First lady Melania Trump and the couple's son, Barron, were on the trip with the president. They left the White House just before 10 am from the residential entrance, after the president took questions from the press on the sentencing of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a myriad of other subject.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen joined them for the flight down to Alabama. Sen. Richard Shelby and Rep. Mike Rogers, both of whom were Alabama Republicans, also flew down with the Trumps.

Following the aerial tour of the damage that the group made via helicopter over Georgia and Alabama, the president and first lady met with survivors of the Lee County tornado and received a briefing from Kathy Carson, the county's emergency manager.

The Trumps toured the Beauregard neighborhood, where they met the family of Sheila Creech and Marshall Lynn Grimes.

Creech fled Panama City after Hurricane Michael in October of 2018 and relocated to Beauregard, where the White House says she was living with Grimes.

Grimes's daughter is in the hospital and her friend, Taylor Thornton, 10, died at the home during the tornado. The Trumps were to meet with son Chris Grimes and his wife Denise, as well as the deceased's brother David and his wife Kristen.

Family members shared with the president and first lady, showing them Grimes' motorcycle vest and his bible. The president hugged the grieving family members.

He told reporters that he recognized the wreckage from his flyover in Marine One.

'I saw this. And it’s hard to believe,' the president said. 'You saw things that you wouldn’t believe.'

Also on their list of stops was the home of Susanne and John Polk, who was in the hospital when the tornado hit. The White House said that Mrs. Polk had left her home to visit her husband when she was informed that a tornado had just hit the area.

A member of the Beauregard Volunteer Fire Department, she aided in the search and rescue of the community.

The Trumps were scheduled to visit with another survivor of the tornado, Tamatha 'Tammy' Cardwell, who was at home when the weather event took place, and her husband James 'Jim' Cardwell.

The president said Tuesday that he would review the wreckage himself on Friday.

'It's been a tragic situation,' Trump said at a White House event on Tuesday. 'But a lot of good work is being done. I'm in constant touch with the governor and also the governor of Georgia.'

He said Friday, as he thanked volunteers, 'We couldn’t get here fast enough.

'I wanted to come the day it happened,' he told them at the makeshift operation at Providence Baptist Church.

President Trump said Monday that he had directed federal emergency managers 'to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes' that injured nearly 100 people.

He told reporters Friday that FEMA had 'done and incredible job' and thanked emergency managers for their efforts.

The first lady made no public comments but shared photos of her family arriving at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington for their flight on Air Force One from the air.

'On our way to visit the great people of Alabama!' she said.

They arrived at Fort Benning's Lawson Army Airfield in Air Force One and traveled to Auburn University Regional Airport across the border in Alabama after that.

After spending several hours in the area, the Trumps left late Friday afternoon for Palm Beach, where the president has two evening events.

A grand jury in Chicago indicted Empire actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on 29 Jan by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" He said Smollett ""adamantly maintains his innocence.""

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of Empire announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces Empire had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

Kelly this week for “CBS This Morning” and witnessed a series of outbursts from the embattled R&B star.

The co-anchor, appearing on Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show” on Thursday, said she had to keep calm so she could continue the interview, a moment eternalized in a viral image featuring Kelly shouting while King sits composed.

“When I see Robert getting really upset and he stands out of his seat, my initial reaction is, please don’t leave, please don’t leave, please don’t leave…we’ve seen him storm out of interviews before,” she told Colbert.

“So I thought if I just sit there quietly looking at him, he would know I’m not going anywhere and I’ll just wait for [him] to finish whatever this is and then [he’ll] sit right back down in his seat,” King added. “And he did that.”

Despite the “menacing” photo of his outburst, King said she was not afraid for her safety, only that Kelly might accidentally hurt her because he was flailing so much.

“If you could see the thought bubble, it would have been ‘ruh-roh,’ please sit back down. You’re looking a little crazy. Please sit back down,” she said.

Amid reports that CBS is trying to make a new contract with her, King was lauded this week for keeping a cool head and remaining assertive during the sit-down. She drew praise from fellow journalists and other celebrities, including her best friend Oprah Winfrey and singer Elton John.

But King did take issue with erroneous praise from Fox News. The network’s Jesse Watters gave her props but mistook her for ABC’s Robin Roberts, a fellow black journalist whose interview last month with “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was reevaluated after an investigation of his case went sideways.

Watters’ co-anchor, Dana Perino, corrected him on air and Watters apologized, but King later emailed Perino, whom she doesn’t know, to thank her while getting in a jab at Watters.

“It was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people,” she wrote Perino, “and could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike. Could you please just share that?”

CBS has been rolling out segments from King’s conversation with Kelly all week and was to broadcast “The Gayle King Interview With R. Kelly,” a one-hour, prime-time special featuring interviews with the singer, his girlfriends and their parents, on Friday."

TRUMP-BUDGET DEFICIT

As budget deficit balloons, few in Washington seem to care

WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal budget deficit is ballooning on President Donald Trump’s watch and few in Washington seem to care.

And the political dynamics that enabled bipartisan deficit-cutting deals decades ago has disappeared.

That’s the reality that will greet Trump’s latest budget, which probably will promptly be shelved after it’s received by Congress on Monday.

Trump’s plan for the 2020 budget year will propose cuts to many domestic programs but leave alone Medicare and Social Security.

Top lawmakers are pushing for a reprise of prior deals to use spending cuts or new revenues and prop up additional spending — rather than defray deficits that are again approaching $1 trillion.

It all has deficit hawks in a gloomy mood.

EMPIRE CAST MEMBER-ATTACK-CHARGES

For Jussie Smollett, 1 story equals 16 felony counts

CHICAGO (AP) — A grand jury’s 16-count indictment announced Friday against Jussie Smollett might be the result of prosecutors looking to charge the “Empire” actor for individual lies they contend he told about the night he says he was attacked by two masked men.

The reasons are not explained in the indictment, but legal experts say prosecutors sought indictments on individual details Smollett provided police after he reported being the victim of a racially charged and homophobic attack. Former state appellate judge David Erickson says prosecutors might be trying to protect their case in the event a jury or judge doesn’t believe all of the allegations.

Prominent Chicago attorney Terry Sullivan says the 16 counts may be a signal of just how angry prosecutors and police are at Smollett.

R KELLY-THE LATEST

The Latest: Anonymous person pays R. Kelly’s child support

CHICAGO (AP) — A sheriff’s official says somebody who did not want to be publicly identified handed a check to the Cook County clerk’s office for the full $161,633 back child support R. Kelly needed to be released from a Chicago jail.

Chief Policy Officer Cara Smith says the person wanted to remain anonymous. The section of the bond slip where a person putting up money writes their name and relationship to the inmate has been left blank.

Kelly was released on Saturday, three days after a judge ordered that he be taken into custody when he was unable to come up with the entire amount he owed.

Two weeks ago, when he was charged with aggravated sexual abuse, he was taken to jail and remained there for a weekend until a 47-year-old suburban Chicago business owner posted his $100,000 bail.

ELECTION 2020-MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION

Pot-litics: 2020 Democrats line up behind legalization

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A growing list of Democratic presidential contenders wants the U.S. government to legalize marijuana, reflecting a nationwide shift.

California Sen. Kamala Harris says it’s the “smart thing to do.” New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has sponsored a legalization bill and it’s supported by Harris and fellow Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke, who appears poised to join the 2020 Democratic field, called again this week to end the federal prohibition on marijuana.

The embrace of legal pot is a turnaround from the not-so-distant past.

In 1992, then-White House candidate Bill Clinton delivered a famously tortured response about a youthful dalliance with cannabis, claiming he tried it as a graduate student in England but “didn’t inhale.”

AP-US-TURBULENT-FLIGHT-INJURIES

Turbulence injures at least 25 on flight into New York

NEW YORK (AP) — Officials say a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul has landed safely at New York’s Kennedy Airport after severe turbulence that left at least 32 people injured.

Spokesman Steve Coleman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey says 10 people were taken to a hospital after the plane landed Saturday at 5:35 p.m. One had a broken leg and others suffered bumps, bruises and cuts.

Coleman says most of the passengers were treated inside an airport terminal.

Turkish Airlines Flight 1 encountered the turbulence about 45 minutes before landing at JFK.

The Port Authority spokesman says other airport operations were not affected.

WILD HORSE PASTURES

Wanted: More pastures for West’s overpopulated wild horses

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — The U.S. government is seeking more pastures for thousands of wild horses that have overpopulated Western ranges.

Landowners interested in hosting large numbers of rounded-up wild horses on their property can now apply with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.

The BLM offers individual wild horses for adoption by the public. Horses unlikely to be adopted go to private ranges run by contractors for the agency’s Wild Horse and Burro Program.

Right now, the BLM pays landowners to provide a home for some 36,000 rounded-up wild horses at 37 locations in nine states.

The BLM says three times as many wild horses and burros roam the West than can thrive in balance with the landscape.

VENEZUELA-POLITICAL CRISIS

As blackout eases, Venezuela braces for rival rallies

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuelan security forces are deploying in large numbers in Caracas ahead of planned demonstrations by supporters of opposition leader Juan Guaido.

Police units and members of the National Guard gathered Saturday at some intersections in the Venezuelan capital wearing helmets and carrying shields and other anti-riot gear.

Several columns of security forces moved through the city on motorcycles.

Meanwhile, backers of President Nicolas Maduro planned to hold a rival demonstration as power returned to many parts of Venezuela after the country’s worst blackout.

The blackout started late Thursday, intensifying a deepening economic and political crisis.

National Assembly leader Guaido is staging protests as part of his campaign to oust Maduro and hold elections. Maduro says he is the target of a U.S.-backed coup plot.

AP-US-SPRING-FORWARD

Time isn’t on your side with coming shift to daylight saving

WASHINGTON (AP) — Time isn’t on your side this weekend.

One less hour (of sleep) isn’t the end of the world, but you may be a bit sleepier Sunday morning.

Time to abide by the adage to spring forward (though it’s not yet spring). The shift from standard to daylight saving time comes at 2 a.m. local time Sunday across most of the United States. Consider setting clocks an hour ahead before bed Saturday night.

Daylight will begin to last longer into the evening but the sun will take an hour longer to emerge in the morning.

No time change is observed in Hawaii, most of Arizona, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas.

Standard time returns Nov. 3.

PLANE-EMERGENCY LANDING

Plane makes emergency landing, passengers evacuated

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Authorities say passengers on a plane were evacuated by slides after an emergency landing at a New Jersey airport.

The Federal Aviation Administration says Air Transat Flight 942 was on its way from Montreal to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when it reported a possible fire in the cargo hold and was diverted to Newark Liberty International Airport at 8:30 a.m. Saturday.

The Boeing 737 landed and airport firefighters responded. Passengers were evacuated through emergency slides and taken by bus to the terminal.

A Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman said two of the 189 passengers reported minor injuries, and one was taken to a hospital to be examined.

He said no fire was found and the cause of the smoke remains under investigation.

This story has been corrected to note that there were 189 passengers aboard rather than 89 passengers aboard.

BRITAIN-ISLAMIC STATE

UK official criticized after baby dies in Syrian camp

LONDON (AP) — British Home Secretary Sajid Javid is facing criticism after the death of a U.K. teenager’s baby in a Syrian camp.

Shamima Begum, who had left London as a 15-year-old in 2015 to join the Islamic State group, had pleaded with British authorities before her baby was born to let her return to the U.K. to raise the child.

But Javid revoked her passport, saying Begum hadn’t shown any remorse.

Fellow Conservative Party lawmaker Phillip Lee said Saturday he was “deeply concerned” by Javid’s handling of the case.

He said is it clear 19-year-old Begum “holds abhorrent views,” but called her a child who was a product of British society.

Kirsty McNeill, a director at Save the Children UK, said it is possible the baby’s death could have been avoided.

CHICAGO (AP) — A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

Trump surveys devastation, pays respects to tornado victims

BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) — Standing near the slab that’s all that is left of one family’s garage, President Donald Trump on Friday surveyed the devastation wrought by a powerful tornado that ripped through a rural Alabama town, uprooting trees, tearing homes from their foundations and killing nearly two dozen people.

“We saw things that you wouldn’t believe,” said Trump, overlooking a debris field strewn with branches and other wreckage in Beauregard, which bore the brunt of Sunday’s storm. Mangled metal siding, wood planks, piping and electric wires lay strewn on the ground, along with remnants of everyday life: clothing, a sofa, a bottle of Lysol cleaner and a welcome mat encrusted with dirt.

Trump and the first lady spent the afternoon meeting with survivors, victims’ families and volunteers trying to rebuild after the massive tornado carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide, killing 23 people, including four children and a couple in their 80s, with ten victims belonging to a single extended family.

The trip was a familiar one for Trump, who, now in the third year of his presidency, has travelled to the sites of numerous disasters and tragedies, including hurricanes, shootings and wildfires.

The day began with an aerial survey of the area by helicopter, which flew over swaths of land where trees had been flattened. Trump and his wife, Melania, also visited a church serving as a makeshift disaster relief centre for survivors. He later observed a moment of silence before white wooden crosses commemorating each of the victims.

International Women’s Day: Strikes, protests and holidays

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Marches and protests were held Friday across the globe to mark International Women’s Day under the slogan #BalanceforBetter, with calls for a more gender-balanced world.

The day, sponsored by the United Nations since 1975, celebrates women’s achievements and aims to further their rights.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a commemoration at U.N. headquarters in New York that “remarkable progress on women’s rights and leadership” in recent decades has sparked a backlash from “an entrenched patriarchy.”

And he warned that “nationalist, populist and austerity agendas add to inequality with policies that curtail women’s rights and cut social services.”

“I do not accept a world that tells my granddaughters that economic equality can wait for their granddaughter’s granddaughters,” Guterres said. “I call for a new vision of equality and opportunity so that half the world’s population can contribute to all the world’s success.”

Biden eyes fundraising challenge amid new sense of urgency

NEW YORK (AP) — On the cusp of another White House run, Joe Biden faces a daunting challenge that could complicate his path to the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination: money.

Those close to the former vice-president believe he would start off at a fundraising disadvantage compared to would-be rivals, whose campaigns have benefited from an early flood of small-dollar donations from the most liberal wing of the party. Biden, a 76-year-old lifetime politician with strong connections to the party’s establishment, would be forced to rely on an “old-school grind-it-out” plan to generate campaign cash from wealthy individual donors, according to a person with direct knowledge of Biden’s thinking.

Questions about money are among the nagging issues Biden is still considering as he weighs launching a campaign. He’s decamped this week to St. Croix, a favourite Biden family vacation spot in the Caribbean, to discuss the remaining roadblocks with his wife, Jill.

Biden has long disliked the time-intensive process of political fundraising. But with virtually no campaign operation in key states, he’d need to generate millions of dollars in a matter of weeks should he enter what is expected to be the most expensive presidential campaign in U.S. history.

“He obviously has a lot of friends among the Democratic donor community,” said David Axelrod, one of former President Barack Obama’s top political advisers. “But fundraising today is turbo-charged by social media. He’s not of the social media generation.”

How Facebook stands to profit from its ‘privacy’ push

At first glance, Mark Zuckerberg’s new “privacy-focused vision ” for Facebook looks like a transformative mission statement from a CEO under pressure to reverse years of battering over its surveillance practices and privacy failures.

But critics say the announcement obscures Facebook’s deeper motivations: To expand lucrative new commercial services, continue monopolizing the attention of users, develop new data sources to track people and frustrate regulators who might be eyeing a breakup of the social-media behemoth.

Facebook “wants to be the operating system of our lives,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, director of media studies at the University of Virginia.

Zuckerberg’s plan, outlined Wednesday, expands Facebook’s commitment to private messaging, in sharp contrast with his traditional focus on public sharing. Facebook would combine its instant-messaging services WhatsApp and Instagram Direct with its core Messenger app so that users of one could message people on the others, and would expand the use of encrypted messaging to keep outsiders — including Facebook — from reading the messages.

The plan also calls for using those messaging services to expand Facebook’s role in e-commerce and payments. A Facebook spokesperson later said it was too early to answer detailed questions about the company’s messaging plans.

Chelsea Manning jailed for refusing to testify on WikiLeaks

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — Former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, who served years in prison for leaking one of the largest troves of classified documents in U.S. history, was sent to jail Friday for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks.

U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton ordered Manning to jail for civil contempt of court after a brief hearing in federal court in Alexandria in which Manning confirmed she has no intention of testifying. She told the judge she “will accept whatever you bring upon me.”

Manning has said she objects to the secrecy of the grand jury process and already revealed everything she knows at her court-martial. She said prosecutors have granted her immunity for her testimony, which eliminates her ability to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

“I will not participate in a secret process that I morally object to, particularly one that has been used to entrap and persecute activists for protected political speech,” she said in a statement released after she was taken into custody.

The judge said she will remain jailed until she testifies or until the grand jury concludes its work.

Trump budget will seek funds for border wall, Space Force

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will be making a significant request for border wall funds and seeking money to stand up Space Force as a new branch of the military in the White House budget being released next week, an administration official said Friday.

For the first time, Trump plans to stick with the strict spending caps imposed years ago, even though lawmakers have largely avoided them with new budget deals. That will likely trigger a showdown with Congress.

The official said the president’s plan promises to balance the budget in 15 years.

Trump will seek $750 billion for defence, a boost for the military, while cutting non-defence discretionary spending by 5 per cent, said the official, who was unauthorized to discuss the document ahead of its release and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Budgets are mainly seen as blueprints for White House priorities. But they are often panned on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers craft the appropriation bills that eventually fund the government, if the president signs them into law.

Court denies new trial in ‘Serial’ podcast murder case

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland’s highest court denied a new trial Friday for a man whose murder conviction was chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial.”

In a 4-3 opinion, the Court of Appeals agreed with a lower court that Adnan Syed’s legal counsel was deficient in failing to investigate an alibi witness, but it disagreed that the deficiency prejudiced the case. The court said Syed waived his ineffective counsel claim.

The court reversed a Court of Special Appeals’ judgment, sending the case back to that court with directions to reverse a Baltimore Circuit Court judgment granting a new trial.

Syed is serving a life sentence after he was convicted in 2000 of strangling 17-year-old Hae Min Lee and burying her body in a Baltimore park. More than a decade later, the popular “Serial” podcast brought Syed’s case to millions of listeners with its debut 2014 season. The show revealed little-known evidence and attracted millions of listeners, shattering podcast-streaming and downloading records.

In 2016, a lower court ordered a retrial for Syed on grounds that his attorney, Cristina Gutierrez, who died in 2004, didn’t contact an alibi witness and provided ineffective counsel. The state appealed. The special appeals court upheld the lower court’s ruling last year and the state appealed that decision, too.

Actor Jan-Michael Vincent, known for ‘Airwolf,’ dies at 73

Actor Jan-Michael Vincent, the “Airwolf” television star whose sleek good looks belied a troubled personal life, has died. He was 73.

A death certificate shows that Vincent died of cardiac arrest on Feb. 10, 2019, in an Asheville, North Carolina, hospital. The certificate signed by a doctor says he died of natural causes and no autopsy was performed.

It wasn’t clear why it took several weeks for news of the death to surface before it was first reported Friday by TMZ. Messages left at phone listings for Vincent and his wife weren’t immediately returned Friday.

Born in 1945 in Denver, Colorado, Vincent starred in such films as 1972’s “The Mechanic” and 1978’s “Hooper,” in which he played a stuntman opposite Burt Reynolds. Off-screen, his handsomeness earned him a spot on a cosmetic surgeon’s “Ten Best Noses” list in the late 1970s.

He also starred in the 1983 television mini-series “Winds of War” as the love interest of a character played by Ali MacGraw, “piling up enormous ratings,” according to a contemporary Associated Press account. He earned a Golden Globe nomination.

NCAA can claim victory after losing federal antitrust case

The NCAA was able to claim victory Friday night after a judge ruled against the governing body for college sports in a federal antitrust lawsuit.

U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in Oakland, California said college football and men’s basketball players competing at the NCAA’s highest level should be permitted to receive compensation from schools beyond the current athletic scholarship, but only if the benefits are tied to education.

The NCAA cannot “limit compensation or benefits related to education,” Wilken wrote. That opens the door to athletes receiving more scholarship money to pursue postgraduate degrees, finish undergraduate degrees or study abroad. The NCAA could not, under injunction, limit schools if they choose to provide athletes items that could be considered school supplies such as computers, science equipment or, musical instruments.

“Technically the plaintiffs won the case and the NCAA will not be happy that they were found to be in violation of antitrust law, but ultimately this allows the NCAA to keep the bulk of their amateurism rules in place,” said Gabe Feldman director of the Tulane University sports law program.

The plaintiffs in the so-called Alston cases were seeking much more.

Prosecutors had previously charged him with one count of filing a false report.

The 36-year-old African-American actor told police he had been the victim of a homophobic and racist assault.

Police say he staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied” with his salary.

Last month he was suspended from the Empire TV show he starred in.

Sources told NBC and CNN Mr Smollett had apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence.

What is Jussie Smollett accused of?

Mr Smollett is accused of paying two brothers to stage the attack. Chicago officials also believe that he sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand.

At an earlier hearing, a judge set the actor’s bail at $100,000 (£76,000).

Mr Smollett, who was pictured outside the courthouse after posting bail, denies the charge of felony disorderly conduct.

His lawyers have said they will “mount an aggressive defence” of Mr Smollett, who they described as “a young man of impeccable character”.

What did he say had happened?

Mr Smollett said two white men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him when he went out late at night to buy food from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago on 29 January.

He said they then punched him, poured a potentially chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck – a reference to racist lynchings of African-Americans.

He also claimed the men said “this is Maga country” during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again”.

How has the case unfolded?

Officers began to grow suspicious when they were unable to find any footage of the incident, despite reviewing more than 50 surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses.

But investigators say they managed to use a ride-sharing app to track and identify two brothers who were filmed near the scene.

The men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, flew to Nigeria after the alleged attack. On their return they were held for almost 48 hours.

Officials said they were released without charge after providing information that “shifted the trajectory of the investigation”.

One of the brothers is Mr Smollett’s personal trainer, and both had worked as extras on Empire.

Police say they have a cheque, signed by Mr Smollett, which showed that he had agreed to pay the brothers $3,500.

Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Mr Smollett told at least one of the brothers that he was “dissatisfied” with his salary on the show. According to the Huffington Post, he was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role.

In a press conference, Supt Johnson called the alleged scheme “shameful”, adding: “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

He also accused Mr Smollett of taking “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career”.

Mr Smollett turned himself in shortly afterwards. BBC News."

CHICAGO (AP) — A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

Trump surveys devastation, pays respects to tornado victims

BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) — Standing near the slab that’s all that is left of one family’s garage, President Donald Trump on Friday surveyed the devastation wrought by a powerful tornado that ripped through a rural Alabama town, uprooting trees, tearing homes from their foundations and killing nearly two dozen people.

“We saw things that you wouldn’t believe,” said Trump, overlooking a debris field strewn with branches and other wreckage in Beauregard, which bore the brunt of Sunday’s storm. Mangled metal siding, wood planks, piping and electric wires lay strewn on the ground, along with remnants of everyday life: clothing, a sofa, a bottle of Lysol cleaner and a welcome mat encrusted with dirt.

Trump and the first lady spent the afternoon meeting with survivors, victims’ families and volunteers trying to rebuild after the massive tornado carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide, killing 23 people, including four children and a couple in their 80s, with ten victims belonging to a single extended family.

The trip was a familiar one for Trump, who, now in the third year of his presidency, has travelled to the sites of numerous disasters and tragedies, including hurricanes, shootings and wildfires.

The day began with an aerial survey of the area by helicopter, which flew over swaths of land where trees had been flattened. Trump and his wife, Melania, also visited a church serving as a makeshift disaster relief centre for survivors. He later observed a moment of silence before white wooden crosses commemorating each of the victims.

International Women’s Day: Strikes, protests and holidays

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Marches and protests were held Friday across the globe to mark International Women’s Day under the slogan #BalanceforBetter, with calls for a more gender-balanced world.

The day, sponsored by the United Nations since 1975, celebrates women’s achievements and aims to further their rights.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a commemoration at U.N. headquarters in New York that “remarkable progress on women’s rights and leadership” in recent decades has sparked a backlash from “an entrenched patriarchy.”

And he warned that “nationalist, populist and austerity agendas add to inequality with policies that curtail women’s rights and cut social services.”

“I do not accept a world that tells my granddaughters that economic equality can wait for their granddaughter’s granddaughters,” Guterres said. “I call for a new vision of equality and opportunity so that half the world’s population can contribute to all the world’s success.”

Biden eyes fundraising challenge amid new sense of urgency

NEW YORK (AP) — On the cusp of another White House run, Joe Biden faces a daunting challenge that could complicate his path to the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination: money.

Those close to the former vice-president believe he would start off at a fundraising disadvantage compared to would-be rivals, whose campaigns have benefited from an early flood of small-dollar donations from the most liberal wing of the party. Biden, a 76-year-old lifetime politician with strong connections to the party’s establishment, would be forced to rely on an “old-school grind-it-out” plan to generate campaign cash from wealthy individual donors, according to a person with direct knowledge of Biden’s thinking.

Questions about money are among the nagging issues Biden is still considering as he weighs launching a campaign. He’s decamped this week to St. Croix, a favourite Biden family vacation spot in the Caribbean, to discuss the remaining roadblocks with his wife, Jill.

Biden has long disliked the time-intensive process of political fundraising. But with virtually no campaign operation in key states, he’d need to generate millions of dollars in a matter of weeks should he enter what is expected to be the most expensive presidential campaign in U.S. history.

“He obviously has a lot of friends among the Democratic donor community,” said David Axelrod, one of former President Barack Obama’s top political advisers. “But fundraising today is turbo-charged by social media. He’s not of the social media generation.”

How Facebook stands to profit from its ‘privacy’ push

At first glance, Mark Zuckerberg’s new “privacy-focused vision ” for Facebook looks like a transformative mission statement from a CEO under pressure to reverse years of battering over its surveillance practices and privacy failures.

But critics say the announcement obscures Facebook’s deeper motivations: To expand lucrative new commercial services, continue monopolizing the attention of users, develop new data sources to track people and frustrate regulators who might be eyeing a breakup of the social-media behemoth.

Facebook “wants to be the operating system of our lives,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, director of media studies at the University of Virginia.

Zuckerberg’s plan, outlined Wednesday, expands Facebook’s commitment to private messaging, in sharp contrast with his traditional focus on public sharing. Facebook would combine its instant-messaging services WhatsApp and Instagram Direct with its core Messenger app so that users of one could message people on the others, and would expand the use of encrypted messaging to keep outsiders — including Facebook — from reading the messages.

The plan also calls for using those messaging services to expand Facebook’s role in e-commerce and payments. A Facebook spokesperson later said it was too early to answer detailed questions about the company’s messaging plans.

Chelsea Manning jailed for refusing to testify on WikiLeaks

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — Former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, who served years in prison for leaking one of the largest troves of classified documents in U.S. history, was sent to jail Friday for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks.

U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton ordered Manning to jail for civil contempt of court after a brief hearing in federal court in Alexandria in which Manning confirmed she has no intention of testifying. She told the judge she “will accept whatever you bring upon me.”

Manning has said she objects to the secrecy of the grand jury process and already revealed everything she knows at her court-martial. She said prosecutors have granted her immunity for her testimony, which eliminates her ability to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

“I will not participate in a secret process that I morally object to, particularly one that has been used to entrap and persecute activists for protected political speech,” she said in a statement released after she was taken into custody.

The judge said she will remain jailed until she testifies or until the grand jury concludes its work.

Trump budget will seek funds for border wall, Space Force

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will be making a significant request for border wall funds and seeking money to stand up Space Force as a new branch of the military in the White House budget being released next week, an administration official said Friday.

For the first time, Trump plans to stick with the strict spending caps imposed years ago, even though lawmakers have largely avoided them with new budget deals. That will likely trigger a showdown with Congress.

The official said the president’s plan promises to balance the budget in 15 years.

Trump will seek $750 billion for defence, a boost for the military, while cutting non-defence discretionary spending by 5 per cent, said the official, who was unauthorized to discuss the document ahead of its release and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Budgets are mainly seen as blueprints for White House priorities. But they are often panned on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers craft the appropriation bills that eventually fund the government, if the president signs them into law.

Court denies new trial in ‘Serial’ podcast murder case

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland’s highest court denied a new trial Friday for a man whose murder conviction was chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial.”

In a 4-3 opinion, the Court of Appeals agreed with a lower court that Adnan Syed’s legal counsel was deficient in failing to investigate an alibi witness, but it disagreed that the deficiency prejudiced the case. The court said Syed waived his ineffective counsel claim.

The court reversed a Court of Special Appeals’ judgment, sending the case back to that court with directions to reverse a Baltimore Circuit Court judgment granting a new trial.

Syed is serving a life sentence after he was convicted in 2000 of strangling 17-year-old Hae Min Lee and burying her body in a Baltimore park. More than a decade later, the popular “Serial” podcast brought Syed’s case to millions of listeners with its debut 2014 season. The show revealed little-known evidence and attracted millions of listeners, shattering podcast-streaming and downloading records.

In 2016, a lower court ordered a retrial for Syed on grounds that his attorney, Cristina Gutierrez, who died in 2004, didn’t contact an alibi witness and provided ineffective counsel. The state appealed. The special appeals court upheld the lower court’s ruling last year and the state appealed that decision, too.

Actor Jan-Michael Vincent, known for ‘Airwolf,’ dies at 73

Actor Jan-Michael Vincent, the “Airwolf” television star whose sleek good looks belied a troubled personal life, has died. He was 73.

A death certificate shows that Vincent died of cardiac arrest on Feb. 10, 2019, in an Asheville, North Carolina, hospital. The certificate signed by a doctor says he died of natural causes and no autopsy was performed.

It wasn’t clear why it took several weeks for news of the death to surface before it was first reported Friday by TMZ. Messages left at phone listings for Vincent and his wife weren’t immediately returned Friday.

Born in 1945 in Denver, Colorado, Vincent starred in such films as 1972’s “The Mechanic” and 1978’s “Hooper,” in which he played a stuntman opposite Burt Reynolds. Off-screen, his handsomeness earned him a spot on a cosmetic surgeon’s “Ten Best Noses” list in the late 1970s.

He also starred in the 1983 television mini-series “Winds of War” as the love interest of a character played by Ali MacGraw, “piling up enormous ratings,” according to a contemporary Associated Press account. He earned a Golden Globe nomination.

NCAA can claim victory after losing federal antitrust case

The NCAA was able to claim victory Friday night after a judge ruled against the governing body for college sports in a federal antitrust lawsuit.

U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in Oakland, California said college football and men’s basketball players competing at the NCAA’s highest level should be permitted to receive compensation from schools beyond the current athletic scholarship, but only if the benefits are tied to education.

The NCAA cannot “limit compensation or benefits related to education,” Wilken wrote. That opens the door to athletes receiving more scholarship money to pursue postgraduate degrees, finish undergraduate degrees or study abroad. The NCAA could not, under injunction, limit schools if they choose to provide athletes items that could be considered school supplies such as computers, science equipment or, musical instruments.

“Technically the plaintiffs won the case and the NCAA will not be happy that they were found to be in violation of antitrust law, but ultimately this allows the NCAA to keep the bulk of their amateurism rules in place,” said Gabe Feldman director of the Tulane University sports law program.

The plaintiffs in the so-called Alston cases were seeking much more.

Dwayne Johnson is training his daughter to say he is ‘smarter and better looking’ than Barack Obama.

Yep, that’s right. Forget teaching her how to ride a bike, or potty training, or even how to say the alphabet – The Rock wants 10-month-old Tiana to champion him against the former president and won’t stop until she does.

Taking to Instagram on Friday, Dwayne posted an adorable video of himself and daughter Tiana together.

He’s holding up a card of America’s presidents in the clip and getting Tiana to point him out, with the tot sweetly mistaking Obama for her dad.

Dwayne then asks her: ‘Who’s better looking and smarter?’ and after a (very long) pause from his baby girl, he jokes: ‘You’ve got to answer quick honey, Instagram.’

Seems Tiana is going to take some convincing on that one, but of course, Dwayne is willing to wait it out.

He wrote: ‘Enjoyed teaching my youngest daughter Tiana Gia her answer when asked, “Who’s smarter and better looking… Dada or President Obama?”

‘And despite the fact she took a very long ego crushing pause, I remain optimistic we will shorten her response time dramatically. She kept her cool and didn’t crumble under intense pressure. A future sign of good things to come.’

The Rock’s post came as a sweet tribute to his little girl on International Women’s Day.

He shares Tiana with his partner Lauren Hashian. They are also parents to daughter Jasmin, three, and Dwayne is dad to 17-year-old daughter Simone from a previous relationship.

The former professional wrestler turned actor has just finished wrapping Fast & Furious spin-off Hobbs and Shaw, and has said the movie is ‘easily the most challenging’ movie he has done to date.

He announced it wrapping on Instagram last month and said: ‘Easily the most challenging film I’ve ever produced and starred in, however based on the fans’ insanely hyped “break the internet” reactions to our first trailer — this film is also shaping up to be my most rewarding.’

Dwayne stars alongside Jason Statham, Idris Elba, Roman Reigns, Vanessa Kirby and Helen Mirren.

Hobbs & Shaw will hit cinemas on 2 August.

As budget deficit balloons, few in Washington seem to care

WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal budget deficit is ballooning on President Donald Trump’s watch and few in Washington seem to care.

And even if they did, the political dynamics that enabled bipartisan deficit-cutting deals decades ago has disappeared, replaced by bitter partisanship and chronic dysfunction.

That’s the reality that will greet Trump’s latest budget , which will promptly be shelved after landing with a thud on Monday. Like previous spending blueprints, Trump’s plan for the 2020 budget year will propose cuts to many domestic programs favored by lawmakers in both parties but leave alone politically popular retirement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

Washington probably will devote months to wrestling over erasing the last remnants of a failed 2011 budget deal that would otherwise cut core Pentagon operations by $71 billion and domestic agencies and foreign aid by $55 billion. Top lawmakers are pushing for a reprise of three prior deals to use spending cuts or new revenues and prop up additional spending rather than defray deficits that are again approaching $1 trillion.

It’s put deficit hawks in a gloomy mood.

CHICAGO (AP) — News that a grand jury had indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren’t uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett’s comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

“What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,” said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

R. Kelly: ‘We’re going to straighten all this stuff out’

CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly walked out of a Chicago jail on Saturday after someone who officials say did not want to be publicly identified paid $161,633 that the R&B singer owed in back child support.

Kelly, who was ordered taken into custody on Wednesday by a judge after Kelly said he didn’t have the entire amount he owed, briefly spoke with reporters, telling them: “I promise you, we’re going to straighten all this stuff out.” He said that was all he could say, a stark contrast to a nationally televised broadcast that aired earlier in the week in which he cried and ranted about being “assassinated” by allegations of sexual abuse that led to criminal charges last month.

Cara Smith, the chief policy officer for the Cook County sheriff’s office, which runs the jail, said a person who wished to remain anonymous handed a check on Saturday morning to the county clerk’s office for the full amount of Kelly’s back child support. A bond slip where people putting up money to secure an inmate’s release write their names and relationship to the inmate was left blank, Smith said.

Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, said he could not discuss the child support payment because of a judge’s gag order in that case.

As is done with other high-profile inmates, Kelly, 52, was held in a solo cell under round-the-clock observation.

Pot-litics: 2020 Democrats line up behind legalization

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A growing list of Democratic presidential contenders want the U.S. government to legalize marijuana, reflecting a nationwide shift as more Americans look favorably on cannabis.

Making marijuana legal at the federal level is the “smart thing to do,” says California Sen. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor whose home state is the nation’s largest legal pot shop. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a prominent legalization advocate on Capitol Hill, says the war on drugs has been a “war on people.”

Former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke, who appears poised to join the 2020 Democratic field, has written a book arguing marijuana legalization would hobble drug cartels. In an email to supporters this week, he called again to end the federal prohibition on marijuana.

“Who is going to be the last man — more likely than not a black man — to languish behind bars for possessing or using marijuana when it is legal in some form in more than half of the states in this country?” O’Rourke wrote.

It’s a far different approach from the not-so-distant past, when it was seen as politically damaging to acknowledge smoking pot and no major presidential candidate backed legalization.

Turbulence injures 30 on flight from Istanbul to New York

NEW YORK (AP) — Severe turbulence over the Atlantic Ocean tossed terrified passengers and crew around a Turkish Airlines plane cabin on Saturday, with 30 people suffering bumps, bruises, cuts and a broken leg before the flight landed safely at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, officials said.

Dozens of ambulances lined up in front of a terminal to quickly treat the injured coming off the flight that left Istanbul for the 10-hour trip.

Spokesman Steve Coleman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told The Associated Press that 28 people were taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens after the plane touched down at 5:35 p.m. Two went to Queens Hospital Medical Center. A flight attendant suffered a broken leg, Coleman said.

Turkish Airlines Flight 1 hit the turbulence about 45 minutes before landing at JFK, Coleman said. The crew declared an emergency while the Boeing 777 was still in the air, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

The Port Authority spokesman said other airport operations were not affected.

Trump signed Bibles. Heresy? Many religious leaders say no

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — President Donald Trump was just doing what he could to raise spirits when he signed Bibles at an Alabama church for survivors of a tornado outbreak, many religious leaders say, though some are offended and others say he could have handled it differently.

Hershael York, dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary School of Theology in Louisville, Kentucky, said he didn’t have a problem with Trump signing Bibles, like former presidents have, because he was asked and because it was important to the people who were asking.

“Though we don’t have a national faith, there is faith in our nation, and so it’s not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their Bibles,” he said. “Those Bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are, too.”

But the Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, said she was offended by the way Trump scrawled his signature Friday as he autographed Bibles and other things, including hats, and posed for photos. She viewed it, she said, as a “calculated political move” by the Republican president to court his evangelical voting base.

Presidents have a long history of signing Bibles, though earlier presidents typically signed them as gifts to send with a spiritual message. President Ronald Reagan signed a Bible that was sent secretly to Iranian officials in 1986. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the family Bible his attorney general used to take the oath of office in 1939.

Wanted: More pastures for West’s overpopulated wild horses

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — If you ever wished to gaze at a stomping, snorting, neighing panorama of Western heritage from your living-room window, now could be your chance.

A classic image of the American West — wild horses stampeding across the landscape — not only has endured through the years but has multiplied past the point of range damage. Through May 3, the U.S. government is seeking more private pastures for an overpopulation of wild horses.

Many consider rounding up wild horses to live out their lives on private pastures a reasonable approach to a tricky problem. Wild horses, after all, not only have romantic value, they are protected by federal law.

Just keep in mind a few of the dozens of requirements for getting paid by the government to provide wild horses a home.

“It’s not like you can do this in your backyard, or even a 5 acre (2 hectare) plot,” said Debbie Collins, outreach specialist for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Wild Horse and Burro Program in Norman, Oklahoma.

More blackouts hit Venezuela as opposition, government rally

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The Venezuelan opposition and government loyalists held rival demonstrations in Caracas on Saturday, as both sides prepared for what some fear could be a protracted power struggle.

The rallies unfolded as power and communications outages continued to hit Venezuela, intensifying the hardship of a country paralyzed by economic and political crisis. The blackouts heightened tension between the bitterly divided factions, which accused each other of being responsible for the collapse of the power grid.

“Hard times are ahead,” said opposition leader Juan Guaido, who addressed crowds with a loudspeaker after security forces earlier dismantled a speakers’ stage that the opposition had erected. He said he planned to tour Venezuela to seek support and lay the groundwork for a massive rally in Caracas.

The 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly said he anticipated more government efforts to sideline and intimidate the opposition. However, President Nicolas Maduro’s government has not moved directly against Guaido since he returned to Venezuela from a Latin American tour Monday.

Guaido earlier speculated that Maduro was effectively ignoring him in an attempt to sap the energy of the opposition, whose hopes of ousting the government have so far been stymied.

AP Explains: What Facebook’s ‘privacy vision’ really means

NEW YORK (AP) — Mark Zuckerberg’s abrupt Wednesday declaration of a new “privacy vision ” for social networking was for many people a sort of Rorschach test.

Looked at one way, the manifesto read as an apology of sorts for Facebook’s history of privacy transgressions, and suggested that the social network would de-emphasize its huge public social network in favor of private messaging between individuals and among small groups.

Looked at another, it turned Facebook into a kind of privacy champion by embracing encrypted messaging that’s shielded from prying eyes — including those of Facebook itself.

Yet another reading suggested the whole thing was a public-relations exercise designed to lull its users while Facebook entrenches its competitive position in messaging and uses it to develop new sources of user data to feed its voracious advertising machine.

As with many things Facebook, the truth lies somewhere in between. Facebook so far isn’t elaborating much on Zuckerberg’s manifesto. Here’s a guide to what we know at the moment about its plans.

Time isn’t on your side with coming shift to daylight saving

WASHINGTON (AP) — Time isn’t on your side this weekend.

One less hour (of sleep) isn’t the end of the world, but you may be a bit sleepier Sunday morning.

Time to abide by the adage to spring forward (though it’s not yet spring). The shift from standard to daylight saving time comes at 2 a.m. local time Sunday across most of the United States. Consider setting clocks an hour ahead before bed Saturday night.

Daylight will begin to last longer into the evening but the sun will take an hour longer to emerge in the morning.

No time change is observed in Hawaii, most of Arizona, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas.

CHICAGO — A grand jury in Chicago indicted Empire actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment."

According to the media house, the actor faces are Class 4 felonies, and his arraignment is scheduled for March 14.

In a statement to Pitchfork, Smollett’s attorney Mark Geragos said:

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

This sad drama began on January 29, after it was reported that Smollett had been attacked in Chicago by two men in what appeared to be a hate crime. But the following month, two Nigerian brothers were arrested and questioned by police in connection with the alleged attack. Smollett was categorised as a suspect in the case after the men were released from police custody without criminal charges on February 15. Later that month, Smollett was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.

The grand jury has now returned the disorderly conduct charges and expanded the charges against Smollet, indicting him on 16 felonies. And the indictment states: “Jussie Smollett knew that at the time… there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed.”

We can’t wait to see how this pans out.

Jussie Smollett’s lawyer has said he is ‘adamantly maintaining his innocence’, as he now faces 16 charges for filing a false police report.

The 36-year-old Empire actor was originally charged with one Class 4 Felony charge for disorderly conduct for filing a false report, after claiming he was attacked by two men in a hate crime at the end of January.

In an 86-page indictment (via CWB Chicago), that charge has now been applied 15 times over by Cook County grand jury, meaning he now faces 16 felony counts.

Each charge carries a maximum probation sentence of four years – meaning Jussie is now potentially facing a maximum of three years in prison, a $25,000 fine and 60 years probation.

He stressed that Jussie is still ‘maintaining his innocence’ and continues to deny the charges against him, after he was indicted by a grand jury on Friday.

The statement read: ‘The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.

‘What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.’

‘Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.’

Chicago police announced on Thursday that they were opening an internal investigation into Jussie’s case, following information being ‘leaked’.

They are looking into the leaks, with a police spokesperson stating to TMZ a lot of the information put out there has been ‘inaccurate’.

The 15 new charges Jussie faces are divided between two areas, with the first applying to his initial report to Chicago Police Department. The other charges are for Jussie’s second interview with police.

Jussie has been accused of ‘staging his attack’ – claims he has continuously denied. He is expected in court on 16 March.

Eight of the felonies involve lies that he allegedly told the police officer who filed the report, and eight include lies he told the detective who investigated the case. Smollett’s story went viral after he claimed that he was beaten and restrained by a group of Trump supporters. He was later accused of paying two people to attack him.

On Friday, the Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police department tweeted “As Supt Johnson stated, allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model. We stand behind the work of detectives & refer any comment on indictment to prosecutors.” Smollett’s case has been held out as a prominent example of fake hate crimes following the 2016 Presidential Election.

Since the election, there have been a series of highly publicized incidents of fake hate crimes that have shaken the public’s trust in the media and in hate crime victims. Many prominent voices have accused the media of siding too quickly with the alleged victim of these hate hoaxes. Just two months ago, the mainstream media as well as many celebrities attacked students from Covington High School that were attending a March for Life rally in Washington D.C for harassing a Native American activist. Shortly after the incident, footage and testimony came out that contradicted the initial account.

While hate hoaxes throughout the country continue to abound, there are many instances of verifiable political violence committed against conservatives on a regular basis. Just a month ago, conservative activist Hayden Williams was canvassing for a conservative organization at the University of Berkeley when a far left activist approached him and punched him in the face. It took the media two to three weeks to begin to cover the incident."

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama “Empire,” was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with lying to police about a supposed racist and homophobic attack by supporters of President Donald Trump.

Neither Smollett’s attorney nor his spokeswoman could immediately be reached for comment on the latest charges. Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

At the time he was initially charged, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $35,000 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

Smollett, 36, surrendered to police and was later released on $100,000 bond two weeks ago in connection with the initial charge against him. It was not immediately clear whether the actor would be taken into custody again to face additional charges. He has a court date set for March 14.

The indictment, returned by a grand jury on Thursday, charges Smollett with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging that he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators. A copy of the document was furnished to Reuters by a Cook County Circuit Court clerk.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett’s story, he reported that two masked men approached him on a darkened street on Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

Smollett also told police, according to authorities, that the attackers had yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police had said.

News of the purported assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor’s defense.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologized last month to the cast and crew on the set of “Empire” but maintained his innocence.

“Empire” debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show’s current season."

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected, said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

“The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what’s called a probable cause proceeding. I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,” Geragos told NBC’s “Access” after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on February 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment – eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective – comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck – a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

9:30 p.m.

An attorney for Jussie Smollett says a 16-count indictment against the “Empire” actor is “vindictive” and Smollett “maintains his innocence.”

Mark Geragos says in a statement that he did not expect a Cook County grand jury would charge Smollet with 16 separate counts and the indictment is “prosecutorial overkill.”

He says the indictment “is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy.”

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for making a false report of an attack on him in Chicago. Police say Smollett staged the attack and recruited two brothers to participate. Local media have reported that the Chicago Police Department is investigating leaks to reporters during the investigation of the reported attack.

5:30 p.m.

The16-county grand jury indictment of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett relates to allegations that he lied to police about a reported attack in January – eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker’s eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack.

4:50 p.m.

A grand jury in Chicago has indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment filed Thursday charges him with falsely reporting an offense.

Smollett was charged on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett, who is black and gay, told police in late January that he was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago who wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police say Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

Fox News reports,

The Cook County grand jury indictment, dated Thursday and made public on Friday, gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett, according to The Associated Press. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he'd been attacked in late January. The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge. ... Illinois attorney Rod Drobinski reviewed the indictment and told Fox News the grand jury hit Smollett with a separate count for every different crime he alleged had been perpetrated against him (eight in all) — to each of the officers he spoke with (two). Thus, the 16 total counts.

Smollett’s attorney Mark Geragos says that an indictment “was not unexpected” but “the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against” Smollett is.

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records,” Geragos said in a statement, referring to the internal investigation Chicago PD has launched to address allegations of information being leaked.

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” his attorney said.

Smollett was charged in February with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report in which he claimed he was a victim of an attack by two men who beat him and shouted racist and homophobic slurs.

While Smollett continues to deny the charges, Chicago Police maintain that Smollett is a suspect in its ongoing investigation, accusing Smollett of paying the two men – two Nigerian brothers, one which Smollett said he was hiring as his personal trainer – to stage the alleged attack. Police say the two brothers confessed to the scheme.

Anthony Guglielmi, the chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department (CPD), echoed Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson's previous remarks in tweet on Friday, saying that the “allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model.”

“We stand behind the work of detectives & refer any comment on indictment to prosecutors,"" he wrote.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the Fox network hip-hop drama Empire, was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with lying to police about a supposed racist and homophobic attack by supporters of President Donald Trump.

Neither Smollett’s lawyer nor his spokeswoman could immediately be reached for comment on the latest charges.

At the time he was initially charged, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett had paid two brothers $35,000 ($49,600) to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

Smollett, 36, was arrested and later released on $100,000 ($141,000) bond two weeks ago in connection with the initial charge against him.

The indictment, returned by a grand jury on Thursday, charges Smollett with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging that he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators.

A copy of the document was furnished to Reuters by a Cook County Circuit Court clerk.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett’s story, he reported that two masked men approached him on a darkened street on January 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

Smollett also told police, according to authorities, that the attackers had yelled “This is MAGA country,” referring to Mr Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Smollett took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police had said.

News of the purported assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

His lawyers last month said they were conducting a thorough investigation for the purposes of mounting a defence of the actor.

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected, said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

“The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what’s called a probable cause proceeding.I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,” Geragos told NBC’s “Access” after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on Feb. 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

Empire star Jussie Smollett will be going into the weekend with a legal anvil hanging over his head. According to CBS Chicago, the actor was indicted Friday by a grand jury with 16 felony counts of filing a false police report, after reportedly faking a hate crime in January.

The indictment means that Chicago police presented the grand jury with enough evidence to try Smollett for the 16 charges. The actor will be arraigned Friday, March 14, to formally hear the charges and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.

According to the indictment, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 29, one of whom was wearing a mask. His family later called the incident ""a racial and homophobic hate crime."" However, the investigation led by Chicago police led to two Nigerian brothers who claimed that Smollett paid for the attack with a check. Police claim Smollett orchestrated the attack due to disgruntlement with his Empire paycheck; the actor has denied those accusations.

Smollett has been written out of the rest of Empire's fifth season, which is currently airing on Fox. The studio that produces the series declined to comment on Smollett's indictment.

DHAKA: In the 18 months since Zahid Maleque took office as Bangladesh’s Minister of Health and Family Welfare, he has faced one national emergency after another.

The 61-year-old politician told Arab News that two major health crises meant that he hit the ground running after assuming the high-profile ministerial post.

“First, there was the dengue outbreak which infected 101,354 and killed more than 200 people last year. Despite our limited resources, we successfully overcame that crisis compared to other countries,” he said during an exclusive interview on Monday.

That, however, was a “minor trial” compared to the “Herculean” task of dealing with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The first cases in Bangladesh were detected in March and infections have quadrupled in the past month. As of Tuesday, 120,000 people had tested positive for the disease, with nearly 1,600 deaths reported.

A month ago, on May 23, the total number of infections stood at 32,078.

“It’s a Herculean task because we have a high density of people. This is despite the fact that everything has stopped. It’s an unprecedented challenge and something that has never happened in Bangladesh before,” added Maleque, who served as the country’s junior health minister for five years during the Awami League party’s rule.

Listing the challenges faced by his ministry in dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak, he said: “Finding experienced human resources is a big task for my office at the moment. For example, to treat patients in the ICU (intensive care unit), we need well-trained experts who can’t be sourced overnight,” adding that ensuring a population of 166 million adhered to social distancing rules and health and safety guidelines was an uphill task in itself.

The COVID-19 crisis has also put a massive dent in the Bangladeshi economy – foreign exchange earnings alone are expected to drop by 25 percent or $4 billion, while the country has already lost $3.15 billion in orders due to the pandemic, according to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA).

The textile industry is the largest export-earning source for the country, with the sector generating $36 million last year alone.

While most nations are eager to end virus-induced lockdowns to allow them to reboot their economies, the pressure to do so is even more apparent in countries such as Bangladesh where a significant number of people live below the poverty line.

Despite the limitations, the Bangladeshi government has proposed a budget of $3.43 billion for the next financial year to deal with the COVID-19 crisis.

Maleque, however, said finance was not his most immediate concern.

With Bangladesh registering the world’s highest mortality rate among doctors, he said it was his “sacred duty” to protect frontline workers in the war against the virus which had so far infected nearly 4,000 medics and killed 45 doctors.

“To ensure their safety, the government has provided personal protective equipment (PPE), masks, and other safety gear. We have also reduced their working hours. It will be regrettable if we continue to lose more doctors and medics,” the minister added.

Maleque said authorities were planning to add extra beds in hospitals and recruit thousands more health professionals in addition to the “2,000 new doctors, 6,000 nurses, and 3,000 health technicians” already hired by the government in the past few months.

“We can’t increase the number of hospitals overnight. But we can increase the number of beds and treatment facilities, and that is what we are doing now,” he added.

As an additional measure, the government has set up isolation centers in the capital Dhaka – which has the highest concentration of COVID-19 victims in the country – with plans in place to enforce a “zone-based” lockdown soon.

“We are in the process of identifying the worst-affected zones in Dhaka. The government has already initiated a zone-based lockdown in the most-affected areas and is considering the intensity of infection; the areas will be marked as red, yellow, and green. Already, 15 districts have been under the new lockdown for the past 21 days,” he said.

To contain the spread of the virus, Bangladesh enforced a nationwide lockdown more than two months ago, on March 26, but lifted restrictions in “a limited capacity” on May 31, despite a sizeable uptick in infections.

Justifying the government’s decision to reopen offices and industrial units, Maleque pointed out it “had to strike a balance between life and livelihoods.”

He said: “As a developing nation, we have to make it work together. We have to contain the virus and keep rolling the economic cycle of the country. In this context, we had no other choice,” adding that despite a sharp increase in the infection rate, Bangladesh was yet to procure rapid testing kits.

“It (the procurement of testing kits) has yet to be approved by the WHO (World Health Organization). There are some risk factors too, as it generates wrong results in some cases. If a coronavirus positive is falsely detected as negative, the person can infect many others. It’s also dangerous for the infected person. Therefore, we decided against using any rapid test kits unless we get reliable ones,” he said.

Admitting that Bangladesh had not been able to achieve the desired results from the lockdown, Maleque said his ministry’s top priorities for the next year would be to “ensure treatment for all COVID-19 patients in the country.”

He added: “The lockdown was successful only to some extent. If people don’t follow the instructions issued by the government, it will be complicated to manage and mitigate the ongoing health emergency.”

However, he remained optimistic about overcoming the crisis and was grateful for the “opportunity to serve people.”

Maleque said: “There are challenges of course, but there’s a satisfaction in saving lives. Once we overcome this crisis, people will remember us forever.”"

In the indictment handed down Friday, the grand jury delivered two separate lists of charges. One related to what the actor told police officers about the attack; the other centered on his second interview with Chicago police. The indictment said that Smollett knew then that “there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed.”

Asked by Cooper if it is correct that Smollett—who was charged with filing a false police report last month—was charged separately for each alleged lie he told police, Geragos called it “outrageous” for his client to have been charged so many times, especially since he “maintains his innocence” and that he was in fact the victim of a hate crime.

The attorney went on to claim that reports that Smollett was dissatisfied with his Empire pay and had been suspended from the show were both false, prompting him to blast the media at large for the way it has covered this story.

“What is happening here is, frankly, a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions,” Geragos exclaimed. ”That's the reason I got into this. I've never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case has. It’s startling the way people assume he’s guilty.”

The attorney then asserted that the $3,500 check that Smollett allegedly gave two brothers to stage the hate crime assault was actually for physical training. When pressed by Cooper as to why the brothers would purposely attack Smollett while “using Trump language” and tying a noose around his neck if Smollett had hired them as trainers, the attorney attempted to flip the questions around.

“I haven't interviewed them, but I will ask you this, why is it that if they did this and they were in cahoots and if they went in front of a grand jury, why weren't they indicted?” Geragos declared. “Number two, the police chief is the one who says they waited until the 47th hour before all of a sudden they were visited and they changed their story. And they haven't been given an immunity. Why is that?”

The CNN anchor eventually ended the interview by noting how “weird” and “odd” this all seems if you try to take Jussie Smollett at his word about what happened."

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected, said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

“The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what’s called a probable cause proceeding.I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,” Geragos told NBC’s “Access” after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on Feb. 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes.

""The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.""

Empire star Jussie Smollett will be going into the weekend with a legal anvil hanging over his head. According to CBS Chicago, the actor was indicted Friday by a grand jury with 16 felony counts of filing a false police report, after reportedly faking a hate crime in January.

The indictment means that Chicago police presented the grand jury with enough evidence to try Smollett for the 16 charges. The actor will be arraigned Friday, March 14, to formally hear the charges and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.

According to the indictment, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 29, one of whom was wearing a mask. His family later called the incident ""a racial and homophobic hate crime."" However, the investigation led by Chicago police led to two Nigerian brothers who claimed that Smollett paid for the attack with a check. Police claim Smollett orchestrated the attack due to disgruntlement with his Empire paycheck; the actor has denied those accusations.

Smollett has been written out of the rest of Empire's fifth season, which is currently airing on Fox. The studio that produces the series declined to comment on Smollett's indictment.

CHICAGO, March 8 (Reuters) - Television actor Jussie Smollett, arrested last month on a single charge of perpetrating a hate-crime hoax, has been newly indicted on 16 felony counts of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two strangers shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as ""redundant and vindictive,"" adding that his client ""adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.""

He also said that leveling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defense cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $3,500 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

NO FURTHER ARREST

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on Feb. 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week's indictment ""because it's the same case,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett's claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett's story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor's defense.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologized last month to the cast and crew on the set of ""Empire"" but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, ""to distract from the internal investigation.""

""Empire"" debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show's current season.

A Chicago grand jury on Friday indicted American actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts after allegedly lying to police about being the victim of a racist, homophobic hate crime.

Police say Smollett -- who gained fame on Fox musical drama ""Empire"" -- staged the attack in a bid to gain publicity and a bigger paycheck.

Instead, the 36-year-old actor -- who is black and gay -- has been dropped from the last two episodes of the show's current season, and his future is now in the hands of the court.

Smollett was charged last month with one felony count of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

He allegedly sent himself a threatening letter and then hired two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

According to court documents published online by local media, the 16-count indictment lists the specific statutes Smollett violated by telling police he had been attacked when he knew ""there was no reasonable ground for believing"" that such crimes had occurred.

Smollett has denied the allegations against him and in a statement to the media, his attorney Mark Geragos decried what he called ""prosecutorial overkill.""

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" Geragos said.

The case has drawn intense national interest with everyone from politicians to celebrities and late night talk show hosts commenting.

When asked about the indictment, a Fox spokesman declined to comment.

Smollett was released on bond in February. He is next due back in court on March 14."

5:30 p.m.

The16-county grand jury indictment of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett relates to allegations that he lied to police about a reported attack in January - eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker's eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack.

4:50 p.m.

A grand jury in Chicago has indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment filed Thursday charges him with falsely reporting an offense.

Smollett was charged on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett, who is black and gay, told police in late January that he was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago who wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police say Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

Investigators allege Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself with two men's help and made a false police report.

Police allege Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men hurled slurs and looped a rope around his neck on January 29 in downtown Chicago.

ABC News in America reports there are two new sets of charges.

Smollett first told police the alleged attackers yelled ""MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make American Great Again"" slogan.

The next set of charges are linked to a second police interview Smollett had about the alleged attack.

The new charges each carry a possible sentence of probation to four years.

Smollett was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct for the allegedly false report he made with Chicago police. The disgraced actor handed himself into police.

He has already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge.

Empire actors Abimbola 'Abel' (left), and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo (right) were questioned over the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett.

He surrendered his passport and was taken into custody and later paid $US100,000 to get bail.

The two alleged attackers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were arrested on February 13 but later released without charge.

Police have said they are no longer considered suspects.

The “Empire” actor is facing the charges after it was alleged he filed a false police report when he claimed to be the victim of a homophobic and racist hate attack on January 29, 2019.

According to Variety, a Cook County grand jury handed Jussie the indictment on Friday, March 8, after the actor was previously charged with a single count for the alleged false filing, which carries the possibility of up to three years in prison.Of the 16 new counts, eight charges involve false statements given to Officer Muhammed Baig, while the other eight are for a more detailed account given to Detective Kim Murray.

Smollett had told police he was assaulted at 2 a.m. by two men who shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him and put a noose around his neck. In the more detailed account, he claimed that he fought back and that one of the attackers was White.

The indictment read: “Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission there was no reasonable ground for believing that such an offense had been committed.”

And although he faces several charges, former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg says the number of counts won’t have an effect on Smollett’s sentence, should he be convicted.

Weisberg told Variety magazine that the counts will run concurrently, so the sentencing range would still be one to three years in prison.

He added: “I would still expect a period of probation, a psychological evaluation and restitution to cover costs of the investigation. I would still be surprised if he goes to prison.”

Smollett has denied the allegations against him, and his attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson recently said a “thorough investigation” into the claims is still ongoing.

They said: “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.

“Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”"

Empire star Jussie Smollett will be going into the weekend with a legal anvil hanging over his head. According to CBS Chicago, the actor was indicted Friday by a grand jury with 16 felony counts of filing a false police report, after reportedly faking a hate crime in January.

The indictment means that Chicago police presented the grand jury with enough evidence to try Smollett for the 16 charges. The actor will be arraigned Friday, March 14, to formally hear the charges and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.

According to the indictment, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 29, one of whom was wearing a mask. His family later called the incident ""a racial and homophobic hate crime."" However, the investigation led by Chicago police led to two Nigerian brothers who claimed that Smollett paid for the attack with a check. Police claim Smollett orchestrated the attack due to disgruntlement with his Empire paycheck; the actor has denied those accusations.

Smollett has been written out of the rest of Empire's fifth season, which is currently airing on Fox. The studio that produces the series declined to comment on Smollett's indictment.

Geragos decried the grand jury indictment of Smollett on 16 felony counts as an “outrage,” saying, “I defy anybody to find any indictment anywhere where somebody has brought 16 counts for being a victim of a hate crime.”

“They have not talked to one person at Fox who has said he was dissatisfied with his money,” he continued. “They have not interviewed one person connected with the show Empire who says he was dissatisfied with his money. They are the ones that started their internal investigation about the leaks because all of the information that was being leaked was false.”

Geragos continued:

“What is happening here is frankly a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions. And that’s the reason I got into this. I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty. He hasn’t been given one stitch of discovery. There isn’t one police report. Your package just said he paid $3,500. I’ve got the texts. Those texts––and they conceded that the check and the texts were for training. It wasn’t to pay anything! So I don’t understand how it comes from.”

At one point Cooper asked, “But doesn’t it just seem weird to you that you get allegedly attacked by two people who you know and you don’t claim to recognize them, even you claimed you fought back and they ran away, and I believe initially Mr. Smollett said one of them was white, or they were white. Isn’t it just weird that you get allegedly attacked by two people you actually know that have been on Empire that, who you have actually worked out with, and you don’t recognize them?”

Geragos insisted that “I haven’t seen one piece of evidence and they don’t have one piece of evidence that they’ve turned over that links Jussie to this.”

Share Tweet By: AP

A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected, said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

“The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what’s called a probable cause proceeding.I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,” Geragos told NBC’s “Access” after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on Feb. 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes."

Smollett received eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

The 36-year-old actor was charged on February 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Neither Smollett's attorney nor his spokeswoman could immediately be reached for comment on the latest charges.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, told police in late January that he was attacked by two men on his way home from a sandwich shop.

He said they beat him, yelled ""this is MAGA country"" — a reference to Donald Trump's campaign slogan — hurled racist and homophobic insults at him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

The US President initially called the alleged attack ""horrible"" but took to Twitter to condemn Smollett's ""racist and dangerous comments"".

Police say Smollett recruited the two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the popular hip-hop drama Empire.

According to court documents, Smollett wrote a personal cheque for $US35,000 to two brothers and gave them $US100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps that were used in the supposed attack.

Smollett has denied all allegations.

Fox has already cut Smollett's character from the show after the actor was arrested and accused of staging a hoax.

His character, Jamal Lyon, will be removed from the final two episodes of the current season, according to Fox, which said it wanted to avoid ""further disruption"" on the set of the show.

What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.

Empire star Jussie Smollett will be going into the weekend with a legal anvil hanging over his head. According to CBS Chicago, the actor was indicted Friday by a grand jury with 16 felony counts of filing a false police report, after reportedly faking a hate crime in January.

The indictment means that Chicago police presented the grand jury with enough evidence to try Smollett for the 16 charges. The actor will be arraigned Friday, March 14, to formally hear the charges and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.

According to the indictment, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 29, one of whom was wearing a mask. His family later called the incident ""a racial and homophobic hate crime."" However, the investigation led by Chicago police led to two Nigerian brothers who claimed that Smollett paid for the attack with a check. Police claim Smollett orchestrated the attack due to disgruntlement with his Empire paycheck; the actor has denied those accusations.

Smollett has been written out of the rest of Empire's fifth season, which is currently airing on Fox. The studio that produces the series declined to comment on Smollett's indictment.

A grand jury in Chicago has returned a 16-count felony indictment against television actor Jussie Smollett, accusing him of falsely reporting to police that he was the victim of a hate-crime assault, according to court documents made public on Friday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with lying to police about a supposed racist and homophobic attack by supporters of President Donald Trump.

Neither Smollett's attorney nor his spokeswoman could immediately be reached for comment on the latest charges. Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

At the time he was initially charged, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $35,000 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

Smollett, 36, surrendered to police and was later released on $100,000 bond two weeks ago in connection with the initial charge against him. It was not immediately clear whether the actor would be taken into custody again to face additional charges. He has a court date set for March 14.

The indictment, returned by a grand jury on Thursday, charges Smollett with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging that he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators. A copy of the document was furnished to Reuters by a Cook County Circuit Court clerk.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett's story, he reported that two masked men approached him on a darkened street on Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the purported assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor's defence.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologised last month to the cast and crew on the set of ""Empire"" but maintained his innocence.

""Empire"" debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show's current season.

Smollett was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago after he allegedly lied to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime.

Investigators allege Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself with two men's help and made a false police report.

Police allege Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men hurled slurs and looped a rope around his neck on January 29 in downtown Chicago.

ABC News in America reports there are two new sets of charges.

Smollett first told police the alleged attackers yelled ""MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make American Great Again"" slogan.

The next set of charges are linked to a second police interview Smollett had about the alleged attack.

The new charges each carry a possible sentence of probation to four years.

Smollett was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct for the allegedly false report he made with Chicago police. The disgraced actor handed himself into police.

He has already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge.

Empire actors Abimbola 'Abel' (left), and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo (right) were questioned over the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett.

He surrendered his passport and was taken into custody and later paid $US100,000 to get bail.

The two alleged attackers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were arrested on February 13 but later released without charge.

Police have said they are no longer considered suspects.

The new charges against Smollett come as Chicago police said they are conducting an internal investigation to determine the source of information leaked anonymously to media during the probe into Smollett's claims he was attacked.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the investigation began after Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct last month.

Guglielmi said no alleged leakers have been identified so far. He says no officers or staff members with the department have been disciplined for releasing information about the case."

King went on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to talk about her interview with R. Kelly and the praise she’s gotten in the fallout. Colbert asked her about the backhanded compliment she received on Fox News from Jesse Watters.

After her interview with Kelly she received universal praise for her poise and grace she maintained in response to the singer’s hysterical responses.

On Wednesday, Watters praised King on an episode of The Five for “totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco.” Watters was attempting to shade King, but it was quickly apparent that he thought King was ABC’s Robin Roberts.

Watters, along with most of the hosts at Fox, have attacked reporters for seeming not being tough enough in questioning Jussie Smollett during interviews. Watters’ co-host, former Bush administration official Dana Perino, quickly corrected him – even as Watters initially tried to say he knew the difference.

It quickly got rough for Watters after the screw-up and King weighed in on Thursday night.

“Oh my gosh, Stephen. I couldn’t believe this,” King said. “I just thought, OK. That’s all right, dude. That’s OK.’”

—Whoopi Goldberg vows to return to The View after pneumonia and sepsis health scare—

She said she emailed Perino to thank her for standing up for her. She also wanted to relay a message to Watters and others at Fox News.

“I got her email and said: ‘Hi, I just wanted to thank you for letting your colleague know that it was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people,” she said. “And could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people don’t look alike? Could you please just share that?’”"

He faces 16 counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed to WLS-TV in Chicago.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” the indictment said, according to WBBM-TV in Chicago.

Smollett came under scrutiny over the past several weeks after he told police two men attacked him while yelling racial slurs and saying this is “MAGA country” — a reference to President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign slogan. The actor-singer was hospitalized with cuts and bruises after he said the men poured a bleach-like substance on him and put a noose around his neck.

But after several weeks of investigation, Chicago police said Smollett staged the attack.

The grand jury returned two indictments for Smollett, one stemming from his initial report of the attack and another from a second interview he gave police. Each charge carries a sentence of up to four years of probation.

Meanwhile, Chicago police want to know who leaked information about the department’s investigation into Smollett to the media.

The internal investigation is looking at the interrogation of two brothers, who police said were paid by Smollett to stage a fake attack on him to garner sympathy and fame. Police said Abel Osundairo and Ola Osundairo were paid $3,500 via personal check with a memo line that reads “personal training.”

Details of the police questioning were leaked to the media at some point. No alleged leakers have been identified, and no Chicago police officers have been disciplined. State police, prosecutors and federal agents all the way to court clerk’s staff had access to the details of the case, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

“I will also add that there were several agencies briefed with information during that time, and some of the information that went out was not factually accurate,” Guglielmi told ABC News on Thursday evening. “These types of investigations are fairly common so that we can determine if we have any integrity issues for future cases.”

Police had obtained a search warrant that led to the check and have text messages between Smollett and the brothers. Smollett was initially charged with a single count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false crime report and was arrested. He pleaded not guilty. He is free on $100,000 bail."

It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he was attacked on January 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected, said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

“The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what’s called a probable cause proceeding. I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,” Geragos told NBC’s “Access” after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on February 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes."

The well-known criminal defense lawyer revealed to Access what this means for his case.

The “Empire” actor’s well-known criminal defense lawyer, Mark Geragos, revealed to Access what this means for his case.

“This is not a newsflash. I expected it,” he shared.

“The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what’s called a probable cause proceeding… I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing.”

The 61-year-old lawyer also gave Scott an update on how Jussie is doing.

“I’ve seen him and I think he is strong, resilient. I am supportive of him,” he shared with Access.

“Look, I will tell you anytime someone is in the public eye and there is this much attention on it, it is a trying experience,” he added.

Jussie was charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly staging his own reported attack back in January. In the police report, he claimed he was assaulted by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs. He also claimed that the men poured an unknown substance on him and put a noose around his neck, per the Chicago Police.

Jussie and his legal team have denied the allegations, and his attorney previously issued a statement when news of his arrest made headlines.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,” the statement read.

Mark will share more on his “Reasonable Doubt” podcast with Adam Carolla, which will air this Saturday.

About a dozen detectives were assigned to the case. Mr. Smollett, who the police said did not have serious injuries, received an outpouring of public support at a time when reported hate crimes were on the rise.

But last month, the authorities revealed that they believed the assault was staged and that Mr. Smollett was upset with his salary for his work on the television series and wanted publicity."

Each of the charges carries a potential sentence ranging from probation to four years.

The disorderly conduct charges refer specifically to “false report of offense” and are Class 4 felonies. Smollett is scheduled to be arraigned on March 14.

Smollett, a black and openly gay actor, told police he was attacked by Trump supporters while he was walking home from a Subway restaurant in Streeterville, Ill., at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He claimed that two masked men attacked him in the street, shouting racist and homophobic slurs as they beat him, put a noose around his neck, and poured a chemical thought to be bleach on him.

In reality, however, according to police, Smollett paid two pals, Ola and Abel Osundairo, $3,500 by check to stage the hate crime attack.

CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar has reported Smollett also directed the brothers to buy the noose at a hardware store and the hat and masks at a store in Uptown. Johnson said police have the check. Police said the two brothers wore gloves during the staged attack, and did punch Smollett, but the scratches and bruises on Smollett’s face most likely were self-inflicted.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” the indictment says.

Smollett was charged last month with a single felony count of disorderly conduct/filing a false report based on allegations brought by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office.

According to CWB Chicago, the grand jury’s indictment states that Smollett made his false report initially to a Chicago beat cop and then did a follow-up interview with a detective later that day.

In one set of charges, the grand jury found that Smollet filed a false police report around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29th in which he told an officer that he was attacked near 341 East Lower North Water Street by two unknown men who were dressed in black and one of whom wore a ski mask. The jury further found that Smollett told the original officer that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs and struck him in the face with their hands. The police report connected to these charges also indicate that Smollett claimed that a noose had been placed around his neck and a “chemical” had been poured on him. The second set of charges returned by the grand jury involves Smollett’s alleged false reporting of the incident to a police detective later the same day. Additional details that Smollett apparently included in the second interview include: the men approached him from behind, Smollett fought back, and all three men fell to the ground where Smollett said he was kicked in the back and felt someone pulling on his neck. During this interview, Smollett also told the officer that one offender was a white male wearing a black mask with an open area around the eyes that exposed the attacker’s skin, the grand jury found.

Although Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said last month that his department believed that Smollett was also responsible for mailing the threat letter to himself, no charges were brought against Smollett in connection with the letter. According to TMZ, “the brothers told police they had nothing to do with the letter, and only saw it in a photo on Jussie’s phone.”

As CWB Chicago notes, Smollett is unlikely to be convicted on more than a tiny fraction of the charges."

A Chicago grand jury has now handed down an additional 16 felony counts against actor Jussie Smollett, all relating to an incident in January in which he’s been accused of fabricating a hate crime attack against himself. Smollett has already been arrested, charged, and released on bail in regards to one felony count of disorderly conduct, but he’s now been indicted on all of the alleged lies he’s been accused of telling police, each of which counts as a separate felony count of disorderly conduct. (Smollett’s attorney dubbed the approach “overkill” tonight.)

This is per The Hollywood Reporter, which notes that Smollett and his attorneys have continued to maintain that the Empire actor’s only involvement in the incident—in which he’s said he was accosted by pro-Trump supporters who attacked him with a rope and poured a mysterious liquid on him—was as a victim. Chicago police arrested him in February on accusations of falsifying the attack with the help of two men associated with the production of the Fox drama.

Smollett could potentially face jail time if he’s convicted, although legal analysts have stated that it’s much more likely he’ll receive probation, with concurrent sentences for whichever of these new charges Cook County prosecutors decide to move forward on. He’s also already been written out of the last two episodes of this year’s season of Empire, although it’s not yet clear if that’s a permanent state of affairs in terms of his long-term employment with the show."

But, those boys (eventually) learned to put the seat down because they grew up around women. To those of you in the office who don't have any women in your personal lives I'm sorry to inform you that you have women in your professional lives. Please put the seat down after you tinkle. Especially on International Women's Day. Also, side note, can we get some tampons in the bathroom? Thanks.

Unvaccinated Oregon boy falls down, gets tetanus: He's the first case of tetanus in Oregon in 30 years. His jaw muscles were spasming and he couldn't open his mouth wide enough to even drink water. The treatment—which turned out to be over $800,000 (!!!)—was just giving him the tetanus vaccine and antibodies from people who had had the tetanus vaccine. He was held in the Intensive Care Unit for 47 days. Vaccinate your kids! (Also, a big thanks to the associate professor from Kansas University for passing along this article.)

There's a bougie rooftop bar in the U-District now: Hotel Deca is no more. The Graduate Hotel has repurposed the space. At the top of the new hotel, there's a rooftop bar called the Mountaineering Club. It's an homage to Edmond Meany, a University of Washington graduate, journalist, and state legislator, according to Seattle Eater. Honestly, this place looks pretty fucking sweet. My only resistance to it is how much I love the grubbiness of the U-District. But with light rail coming to town and the new UW Master Plan in the works, that's bound to change sooner than later.

The closure comes weeks before the school's term ends. Students are stranded with half-finished degrees.

Amazon lobbies to exempt many of its workers from new labor protections: There's a bill in the Legislature right now that would prohibit non-compete clauses, the stipulations that prevent workers from going to work for the competition or start their own companies, for workers who make a certain salary. Amazon wanted to make the threshold for that salary lower so that most of its workers are exempted from the protections. The median income of Amazon workers is $113,000 according to the Seattle Times and they lobbied to get the threshold down to $100,000.

Jussie Smollett indicted on 16 felony counts for allegedly staging the hate crime against him: On Friday, a grand jury indicted the Empire actor on 16 federal counts for faking a police report. This occurred after Smollett allegedly staged an attack against him in late January. Chicago police investigated the attack and found substantial evidence that Smollett had arranged it, including paying the two attackers, aspiring actors who appeared as extras on Empire. Smollett still maintains his innocence.

The U.S. women's soccer team is suing U.S Soccer : On the basis of gender discrimination. This has persisted for years and impacts their paychecks, where they play, and how often they play. Yes! Fuck this system. The U.S. women's team won the Women's World Cup four years ago and they're going to France this summer to defend their title.

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct -- the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police -- are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren't uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett's comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

""What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,"" said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos called the 16-count indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" But prominent Chicago defence attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it's the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

""It is common practice for the Cook County state's attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,"" he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

""If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you're done,"" said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. ""This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.""

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett's account into each individual pieces and accuse him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett's contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

""The lies add up pretty fast,"" Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police. But Lopez finds that unlikely because all the counts list the same date -- Jan. 29.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won't matter whether it's on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That's because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

""If you add them all up it's still only one crime,"" Erickson said. ""That's just how it is.""

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett's legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed -- a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if Smollett did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

""Lying to the FBI is a crime,"" said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" Geragos, his attorney, said."

What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.

Empire star Jussie Smollett will be going into the weekend with a legal anvil hanging over his head. According to CBS Chicago, the actor was indicted Friday by a grand jury with 16 felony counts of filing a false police report, after reportedly faking a hate crime in January.

The indictment means that Chicago police presented the grand jury with enough evidence to try Smollett for the 16 charges. The actor will be arraigned Friday, March 14, to formally hear the charges and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.

According to the indictment, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 29, one of whom was wearing a mask. His family later called the incident ""a racial and homophobic hate crime."" However, the investigation led by Chicago police led to two Nigerian brothers who claimed that Smollett paid for the attack with a check. Police claim Smollett orchestrated the attack due to disgruntlement with his Empire paycheck; the actor has denied those accusations.

Smollett has been written out of the rest of Empire's fifth season, which is currently airing on Fox. The studio that produces the series declined to comment on Smollett's indictment.

CHICAGO — A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

................................................................

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

“The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what’s called a probable cause proceeding.I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,” Geragos told NBC’s “Access” after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on Feb. 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive than the first because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was white. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was charged last month. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers he paid $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective that one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes.

Earlier this week, it was revealed that the Chicago Police opened an internal investigation into Smollet’s case.

In a statement to Fox News on Thursday, a spokesperson for the force confirmed that “an internal investigation has been opened.”

“I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,” the statement continued.

“As a standard procedure, when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.”

In January, Smollett told police that he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a sandwich shop in the early morning on January 29.

The actor, who is black and gay, said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled, “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, before fleeing.

But that isn’t how police say it all went down.

Smollett, who is accused of filing a false police report, was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct.

After he turned himself in, a judge set Smollett’s bond for $100,000 — and he was released from jail.

If convicted, he will face up to three years behind bars.

According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett paid Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo by check for a “phony attack” in order to take “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a press conference last month that police found the “check that [Smollett] used to pay [two brothers]” to fake the beating, adding he paid them $3,500 “for the two of them in total, and then $500 upon return.”

He said the attack “was staged, the brothers had on gloves during the (air quotes) ‘staged attack’ where they punched him a little, but as far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on [Smollett’s] face was most likely self-inflicted.”

Smollett has maintained his innocence. The actor’s legal counsel told Fox News after Smollett was accused of filing the fake police report that the nation “witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election,” his team continued.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Illinois attorney Rod Drobinski reviewed the indictment and told Fox News the grand jury hit Smollett with a separate count for every different crime he alleged had been perpetrated against him (eight in all) — to each of the officers he spoke with (two). Thus, the 16 total counts.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker’s eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Empire star Jussie Smollett will be going into the weekend with a legal anvil hanging over his head. According to CBS Chicago, the actor was indicted Friday by a grand jury with 16 felony counts of filing a false police report, after reportedly faking a hate crime in January.

The indictment means that Chicago police presented the grand jury with enough evidence to try Smollett for the 16 charges. The actor will be arraigned Friday, March 14, to formally hear the charges and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.

According to the indictment, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 29, one of whom was wearing a mask. His family later called the incident ""a racial and homophobic hate crime."" However, the investigation led by Chicago police led to two Nigerian brothers who claimed that Smollett paid for the attack with a check. Police claim Smollett orchestrated the attack due to disgruntlement with his Empire paycheck; the actor has denied those accusations.

Smollett has been written out of the rest of Empire's fifth season, which is currently airing on Fox. The studio that produces the series declined to comment on Smollett's indictment.

Photo: AFP / Chicago Police Department

Prosecutors had previously charged him with one count of filing a false report.

The 36-year-old African-American actor told police he had been the victim of a homophobic and racist assault.

Police say he staged the attack because he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary.

Last month he was suspended from the Empire TV show he starred in.

Sources told NBC and CNN Mr Smollett had apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence.

What is Jussie Smollett accused of?

Mr Smollett is accused of paying two brothers to stage the attack. Chicago officials also believe that he sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand.

At an earlier hearing, a judge set the actor's bail at $100,000.

Mr Smollett, who was pictured outside the courthouse after posting bail, denies the charge of felony disorderly conduct.

His lawyers have said they will ""mount an aggressive defence"" of Mr Smollett, who they described as ""a young man of impeccable character"".

What did he say happened?

Mr Smollett said two white men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him when he went out late at night to buy food from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago on 29 January.

He said they then punched him, poured a potentially chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck - a reference to racist lynchings of African-Americans.

He also claimed the men said ""this is Maga country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"".

How has the case unfolded?

Officers began to grow suspicious when they were unable to find any footage of the incident, despite reviewing more than 50 surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses.

But investigators say they managed to use a ride-sharing app to track and identify two brothers who were filmed near the scene.

The men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, flew to Nigeria after the alleged attack. On their return they were held for almost 48 hours.

Officials said they were released without charge after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"".

One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer, and both had worked as extras on Empire.

Police say they have a cheque, signed by Mr Smollett, which showed that he had agreed to pay the brothers $3500.

Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Mr Smollett told at least one of the brothers that he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary on the show. According to the Huffington Post, he was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role.

In a press conference, Supt Johnson called the alleged scheme ""shameful"", adding: ""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?""

He also accused Mr Smollett of taking ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".

on a very busy Friday night. I'm Tom llamas in for David. We begin with breaking news out of Chicago. New charges for empire actor jussie smollett. A federal jury indicted him with 16 felonies. Smollett originally blaming it on these two men seen on the surveillance image. Tonight he's free on $100,000 bond. His future in greater jeopardy. Steve osunsami starts us off. Reporter: The actor and singer who police say made up a racist attack and then lied to America is now facing 16 new felony charges tonight for lies police say he told during two separate interviews with Chicago investigators. I'm left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? Reporter: Each new charge is for each alleged lie when he told police how he was attacked on his way home from a sandwich shop to his Chicago apartment in the early morning of January 29th. He told them that he was beat up by two men with covered faces who poured a chemical on him and were yelling out racial and homophobic slurs. He's supposed to be well known. Requesting a report. Said a noose was placed over the front's neck. Reporter: In the second interview, police confirm that this is when the actor said that his attackers screamed ""Maga country,"" an allegation that has turned this whole incident into a political controversy. He said, ""This is Maga country, . And punches me right in the face. I punched his Back. Reporter: Police say he paid these two men to stage the attack. In this Instagram post from director Lee Daniels, who created the series that made the actor famous, you see a wound underneath the actors eye, which police say was likely self-inflicted. All right Steve osunsami joins us now. Steve, these are felony charges. What kind of prison time could smollett be facing? He could get up to three years in prison if he's convicted. He's not yet entered a plea on the current charges. He's pleading not guilty on the original charge. Tom? Steve osunsami with that new indictment. Steve, thank you.

""The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records.

Empire star Jussie Smollett will be going into the weekend with a legal anvil hanging over his head. According to CBS Chicago, the actor was indicted Friday by a grand jury with 16 felony counts of filing a false police report, after reportedly faking a hate crime in January.

The indictment means that Chicago police presented the grand jury with enough evidence to try Smollett for the 16 charges. The actor will be arraigned Friday, March 14, to formally hear the charges and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.

According to the indictment, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 29, one of whom was wearing a mask. His family later called the incident ""a racial and homophobic hate crime."" However, the investigation led by Chicago police led to two Nigerian brothers who claimed that Smollett paid for the attack with a check. Police claim Smollett orchestrated the attack due to disgruntlement with his Empire paycheck; the actor has denied those accusations.

Smollett has been written out of the rest of Empire's fifth season, which is currently airing on Fox. The studio that produces the series declined to comment on Smollett's indictment.

The Cook County grand jury indictment filed Thursday charges him with falsely reporting an offence.

Mr Smollett was charged on February 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Mr Smollett, who is black and gay, told police in late January that he was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago who wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police say Mr Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Mr Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

The 16-county grand jury indictment includes eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened on January 29 when he talked to the detective.

It says he gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker's eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck."

Smollett was originally charged with just one count of felony disorderly conduct for the report, but according to the site the report was for one count on each allegedly-false statement made during Smollett’s two interviews with police. Smollett’s alleged accomplices, Ola and Abel Osundairo, told the grand jury that the actor hired them to stage the “attack.” The brothers had told police that they drove with Smollett before the incident around Chicago to scout a location.

A Chicago grand jury handed down the indictments related to two separate police interviews in which Smollett spun his intricate hoax, first reporting the phony homophobic and racist attack and later giving additional details of the fraudulent assault.

The 'facts' of the phony hate crime narrative – in which two masked men yelled racial and homophobic slurs, beat him up, put a noose around his neck, and poured bleach on him – provide the basis of the first set of charges. The second set is based on lurid details of the fake attack that came out later, including how the attackers approached him from behind, their “tussling” on the ground, the feeling of someone pulling on his neck, and – critical to the race-baiting narrative – the fact that the culprits were white males and that Smollett was able to see this because their masks didn’t cover the men’s eyes.

Each of the charges carries a potential sentence of up to four years, though local media reports ‘experts’ believe he might strike a plea deal to avoid prison. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to an earlier charge of disorderly conduct last month and was released on $100,000 bond.

Empire star Jussie Smollett will be going into the weekend with a legal anvil hanging over his head. According to CBS Chicago, the actor was indicted Friday by a grand jury with 16 felony counts of filing a false police report, after reportedly faking a hate crime in January.

The indictment means that Chicago police presented the grand jury with enough evidence to try Smollett for the 16 charges. The actor will be arraigned Friday, March 14, to formally hear the charges and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.

According to the indictment, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 29, one of whom was wearing a mask. His family later called the incident ""a racial and homophobic hate crime.""

According to WLS, the former “Empire” star is facing 16 counts of disorderly conduct in connection with allegedly filing a false police report. The indictment was handed down on Thursday at a Cook County court.

As CrimeOnline previously reported, Smollett faced increasing scrutiny after initially claiming he was the victim of a violent hate crime outside of a Chicago restaurant in January.

He was later arrested on suspicion of conspiring to orchestrate the incident and paying two acquaintances to help pull it off.

He was locked up and later released after posting $100,000 bond. If convicted, each felony charge carries a possible sentence of up to three years.

According to CWB Chicago, the charges relate to two alleged crimes. First was the police report he filed on January 29, which investigators say was fraudulent. Secondly, Smollett spoke to a police detective later the same day, allegedly making false claims about the circumstances surrounding the incident.

Smollett could potentially enter into a plea deal with prosecutors to avoid jail time altogether.

Additional federal charges could still be forthcoming related to an incident days before the supposed hate crime. He claimed a threatening letter in an envelope containing a powdery substance had been addressed to him at the television studio where he worked on the Fox series.

In a previous statement, Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said Smollett was upset that the letter he allegedly sent himself did not attract enough media attention. He allegedly staged the hate crime in response, motivated in part by dissatisfaction with his salary.

The multiple counts highlight different aspects of Smollett’s allegedly phony story, including claims that his attackers beat him, poured a chemical substance on him and put a rope around his neck.

The indictment comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors charged Smollett with a single felony count and he was released from Cook County Jail after a friend posted his $100,000 bond.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in the Leighton Criminal Court Building on Thursday so a judge can be assigned to preside over his case and he can plead not guilty to the 16 counts.

The actor, 36, is accused of staging a phony attack on himself, then telling police he was the victim of a hate crime.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, has said he was walking from a Subway sandwich shop to his apartment in downtown Chicago around 2 a.m. Jan. 29 when two men walked up, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him and wrapped a noose around his neck.

Smollett said they also yelled “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan of “Make America Great Again.”

Police initially treated the incident as a hate crime, but their focus turned to Smollett after two brothers who were alleged to have been his attackers told police that Smollett had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack — with a promise of another $500 later.

Police pieced together much of their evidence by reviewing footage from about 55 police and private surveillance cameras showing the brothers’ movements before and after the attack.

The shift in the investigation came amid often bitter public debate and stinging skepticism on social media — doubts that Smollett addressed in a national TV interview and in a strongly worded statement after the brothers were released from custody after questioning by police.

A week before the alleged attack, Smollett told police he received a threatening letter at work. Witnesses told police a postal worker dropped off the letter at the Chicago studio where “Empire” is filmed. It was postmarked in Bedford Park, a southwest Chicago suburb, on Jan. 18 and bore two American flag stamps. The letters “MAGA” were handwritten in the upper left corner of the envelope.

Prosecutors said Smollett staged the attack because he was unhappy with the studio’s response to the threatening letter. Chicago police took it a step further, accusing Smollett of faking the letter as well.

The letter is the subject of a separate federal investigation.

On Feb. 21, the day Smollett was initially charged, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson blasted the actor, saying the hoax dragged “Chicago’s reputation through the mud.”"

In a separate statement provided to TheWrap, Geragos said: “The fact of an indictment was not unexpected.

Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for making a false report by a Chicago grand jury Friday, according to NBC News. A spokesperson for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Smollett is due back in court on Thursday, March 14 at 11:30 a.m CST.

“Obviously, they have their ability to do whatever they’re going to do and we will push back against it,” Geragos said in his taped interview. This is not the first time the high-profile defense attorney has spoken publicly about the case; he commented extensively on his “Reasonable Doubt” podcast last month that he co-hosts with Adam Carolla.

Smollett was originally charged with one felony count for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office last month, in connection to the incident that he reported on Jan. 29 where he said he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.”

Smollett surrendered himself to Chicago police on Feb. 21, hours after he was formally charged. He was released from police custody later that afternoon, after posting bail and surrendering his passport following a bond hearing.

Smollett’s team put out this statement after the actor was released: “Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Within hours of his release from police custody, Smollett returned to work on the set of “Empire.” However, the following day, executive producers announced that they had decided to remove the actor — who plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon — from the final two episodes of the show’s current season. Representatives for Fox did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment on this story.

During a press conference last month, hours after Smollett’s surrender, Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that the actor staged an attack on himself because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.” He also told reporters the police were in possession of a $3,500 check, which he said Smollett used to pay brothers Olabinjo (“Ola”) and Abimbola (“Abel”) Osundairo for the incident.

The Fox drama’s star is making around $125,000 per episode of “Empire,” an individual with knowledge told TheWrap, who added there had been no salary dispute between Smollett and the studio and that he had never even approached them about a raise.

Last week, the Osundairo brothers released a statement through their lawyer Gloria Schmidt expressing “tremendous regret” for their participation. The Osundairos were released without charges Feb. 15, following an arrest and 48-hour hold, after the police said “new evidence” had emerged and that the investigation’s “trajectory” had changed course.

A week before Smollett reported the attack, Fox received a letter threatening Smollett. In mid-February, ABC News reported that the FBI and U.S. Postal Service were looking into the possibility that Smollett had sent the threatening letter to himself, or played a role in its creation and delivery."

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, Nigerian brothers who at one time were considered suspects in the attack the Smollett, told police they had been paid $3,500 by the actor to stage the attack. They later apologized for their role in the incident.

The case stirred raging social media passions nationally. Smollett received the support of prominent Democrats such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who later distanced themselves from Smollett.

WLS-TV reported that the grand jury handed up the charges on Thursday. It said there were two sets of indictments — one stemming from Smollett’s initial testimony about the attack and the second from a subsequent interview Smollett had with police. Each of the charges represents a specific act about which police accuse Smollett of lying.

The Cook County, Illinois, State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed the indictment.

The new charges are Class Four felonies, CBS reported. Each carries a potential sentence that could be as light as probation or as serious as four years in jail.

Smollett will be arraigned on Thursday.

Neither Smollett nor his attorneys had any immediate comment on the indictment.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,” Smollett’s attorneys had said last month, according to CNN.

The high-profile attention the case received will complicate efforts to resolve it, attorneys have said.

“This is publicly known that it took so many resources away from Chicago’s police department that, how are you going to justify it with giving him a slap on the wrist?” said Steven Goldman, a Chicago defense attorney, CNN reported.

“So I think his case is going to be a little more difficult than just (a) regular ordinary defendant’s case because its profile is so (high) right now,” he said.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has said he felt Chicago was unfairly slammed because of the incident.

“The city of Chicago has its issues, the Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that, and I’m acutely aware of that.

The panel returned the charges on Thursday.

The Empire actor was initially charged last month with one count of disorderly conduct related to the accusation that he falsely reported that he had been physically attacked on Jan. 29 by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

The expanded charges focus on the allegedly false statements he made to two Chicago police officers about the incident.

According to Chicago's ABC7,

""The new set of charges each carry a possible sentence of probation to four years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.""

Chicago police say that Smollett staged the attack to advance his career.

The openly gay black actor who faked a hate crime because he was upset over his salary on the television series “Empire.” Yet, there were other reports that suggested he was upset that a racist letter, that he allegedly made and sent to himself, which was covered in white powder—later determined to be aspirin, did not get enough media attention. The actor claimed in January that two white men wearing red hats hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, threw bleach on him, and put a rope around his neck in the early morning hours when the temperatures were around sub-zero. Yeah, it was suspect from the start. In the end, it was a total hoax and Smollett’s antics were brought before a grand jury.

In the end, it was two Nigerian brothers, one of which was an extra on “Empire,” while the other was a former personal trainer of the actor. They knew him. He wrote them a $3,500 check to carry out this so-called assault. They reportedly had rehearsals. The brothers are caught on surveillance footage buying the supplies for the hoax. And the national media got played once again because Trump derangement syndrome has so rotted the newsrooms of America. I mean, you all know it was already bad; Trump’s 2016 win has accelerated the decay.

The Cook county State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed the indictment, which they said was returned by a grand jury on Thursday.

Smollett could face over three years in prison for filing a false police report and paying actors to stage the attack.

ABC 7 reports: Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office on Feb. 20.

Now the grand jury has returned 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. He said two men physically attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, threw a chemical liquid on him and looped a rope around his neck.

The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.

The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.

The new set of charges each carry a possible sentence of probation to four years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.

Experts believe it is likely he will strike a plea deal and potentially not spend time in prison.

Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack.

But the investigation turned on Smollett. He’s now accused of allegedly orchestrating the attack with the Osundairo brothers, who he knew. One brother was an extra on “Empire” and the other was Smollett’s personal trainer.

Smollett had also reported a threatening letter sent to him on the “Empire” set containing a white powder, a week before the alleged attack. The letter is currently in the FBI crime lab for analysis, sources said, and experts believe Smollett could face federal charges for allegedly sending the letter.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the actor initially faked a letter using racist and homophobic language. When that didn’t get attention, Johnson said, Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 via personal check to stage the attack, because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.”"

The indictment charges Smollett with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

Smollett's attorneys said they have no statement at this time. He remains out on bail pending an arraignment Thursday.

Smollett reported to police in January that he had been attacked in Chicago in an incident that ended with a noose around his neck. Police initially investigated the case as a possible hate crime.

The counts in the indictment obtained by CNN say Smollett gave statements to a Chicago police officer after the incident and to a detective. Details in some of those statements were different, the indictment says.

After police detained two brothers who were ""persons of interest"" in mid-February, police sources revealed that authorities suspected Smollett knew the men and allegedly had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. The men were released without being charged.

Smollett has denied any involvement in orchestrating an attack.

Smollett was charged in February with felony disorderly conduct. The judge granted a $100,000 bail, and Smollett paid a $10,000 bond. He was ordered to give up his passport and will remain under supervision until his case is adjudicated.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,"" Smollett's attorneys said in February.

The subsection of the Illinois law states: ""A person commits disorderly conduct when he or she knowingly ... (4) Transmits or causes to be transmitted in any manner to any peace officer, public officer or public employee a report to the effect that an offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed, knowing at the time of the transmission that there is no reasonable ground for believing that the offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed.""

The producers behind Empire decided to remove Smollett's character, Jamal, from the final two episodes of the season. The decision was made to ""avoid further disruption on set,"" producers said.

A spokesperson for Fox said Friday the company has no comment.

CWBChicago reports that the grand jury’s 16-count true bill stated that Smollett lied to two police officers about the incident.

In one set of charges, the grand jury stated that Smollett filed a false police report at 2 a.m. on January 29, saying that he was attacked by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs while hitting him the face. He also noted that a noose was placed around his neck and a chemical was poured on him.

In the second set of charges, Smollett allegedly falsely reported the incident to another detective that same day. In the second interview, he claimed that the men approached him from behind, kicking him, but that he fought back. He also claimed that one of the attackers’ skin was white.

Each charge could carry a potential sentence of probation to three years if convicted.

Smollett is due in court next week.

Last week, two men involved in the scandal are apologizing for their actions. A lawyer for Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo spoke on their behalf, telling CNN, “My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson recently appeared on “Good Morning America” to discuss the case. After slamming Smollett in February, he said, “Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave. There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence, and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

Smollett's legal team recently came to his defense, saying, ""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing. Today, we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election.”"

Smollett’s case began to unwind the minute the news came out. I mean, Chicago is nowhere near being a MAGA country. I beg my parents not to wear their MAGA hats around town.

From CBS Chicago:

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, had told police he was attacked as he was walking home around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He claimed two masked men – one of them also wearing a red hat – shouted racist and homophobic slurs as they beat him, put a noose around his neck, and poured a chemical on them. Police said, in reality, Smollett had paid those two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, $3,500 by check to stage the attack. CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar has reported Smollett also directed the brothers to buy the noose at a hardware store and the hat and masks at a store in Uptown. Johnson said police have the check. Police said the two brothers wore gloves during the staged attack, and did punch Smollett, but the scratches and bruises on Smollett’s face most likely were self-inflicted. Police at the time said the attack was a publicity stunt because the actor was upset about his pay on the show.

The grand jury returned the indictment on Thursday, CBS Chicago reported. Each one of the charges carries a maximum count of four years in prison, meaning he could face 64 years in total.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and openly gay, plays Jamal Lyon on Fox's hit TV show, ""Empire,"" a drama that chronicles a family-run record label. He told police he was attacked by two masked men when he was returning home from a Subway sandwich store Jan. 29 around 2 a.m.

Smollett claimed the two men had beat him, said homophobic and racial slurs and put a noose around his neck before fleeing. He said he heard, ""this is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Trump's campaign slogan.

Police arrested two brothers who they initially linked to the alleged attack. But police said the brothers then said Smollett had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. Police said they told them the rope that was found around Smollett's neck was purchased at a nearby hardware store. A raid of their home turned up ropes, masks and bleach.

Police said the two brothers wore gloves during the staged attack and did punch Smollett, but the scratches and bruises on Smollett's face most likely were self-inflicted, CBS Chicago reported.

Sources told CBS Chicago that Smollett was angry that he did not receive a ""bigger response"" from a threatening letter sent to ""Empire."" The letter, later published by TMZ, contained a homophobic death threat against Smollett spelled out in cut-up letters. The envelope reads ""MAGA,"" an apparent reference to President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

But police later alleged Smollett sent that letter. Smollett turned himself in on Feb. 21 and was released hours later after posting $10,000 bond.

On Feb. 22, the television show ""Empire"" said Smollett would be written out of the last two episodes of the season, which still had yet to be filmed. On Friday, 20th Century Fox said the studio and the network had no comment.

Jussie Smollett leaves a courthouse on Feb. 21. (Kamil Krzaczynski/AP, File) By Sonia Rao Sonia Rao Pop culture reporter Email Bio Follow March 8 at 6:30 PM A Cook County, Ill., grand jury has indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts for allegedly lying about a hate-crime attack, according to multiple reports. The indictment, returned Thursday, comes two weeks after prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told Chicago police in late January that he had been attacked by two people who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him, poured a chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck. He also said that at least one of the attackers had yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan. The incident attracted a great deal of attention, as celebrities and advocacy organizations expressed their support on social media, and Smollett said on “Good Morning America” in mid-February that he was “forever changed” by the incident.

But skepticism about Smollett’s account grew as police continued to investigate, questioning two “persons of interest” who turned out to be brothers of Nigerian descent who had previously worked on Fox’s “Empire.” Within days of the “Good Morning America” interview, police announced that the trajectory of the criminal investigation had shifted, and that Smollett was being treated as a suspect.

[ How the Jussie Smollett case unfolded, from his initial police report to his eventual arrest ]

Smollett was arrested Feb. 21, and at a court hearing that same day, prosecutors alleged he had paid the two men, Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, to help him stage the attack. They said Abel Osundairo and Smollett were close when they worked together on the set of “Empire,” where Abel was a stand-in for a love interest of Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, and Ola was an extra. Prosecutors also alleged that Smollett told the brothers what to say and provided them with a $100 bill to cover supplies, including rope, ski masks and red hats that resemble the MAGA sort.

Chicago police said at a Feb. 21 media briefing that Smollett faked the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on the Fox drama. Executive producers said in a statement issued the next day that Smollett’s character would be removed from the current season’s final two episodes.

Smollett was released on $100,000 bail, and his attorneys have previously denied that he played a role in the attack. His attorneys and the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office have not returned The Washington Post’s requests for comment on the 16-count indictment.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the US TV network hip-hop drama Empire, was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with lying to police about a supposed racist and homophobic attack by supporters of US President Donald Trump.

Neither Smollett's lawyer nor his spokeswoman could immediately be reached for comment on the latest charges.

AP Actor and singer Jussie Smollett said he was attacked in Chicago by two masked men who used derogatory language and put a rope around his neck. He has now been accused of falsely reporting a hate crime.

At the time he was initially charged, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett had paid two brothers US$35,000 ($51,400) to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

CHICAGO — A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment filed Thursday says he made a false report about an offense.

The Cook County State’s Attorney charged Smollett on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett told police in late January that he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor said the men shouted at him, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police said Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

After an investigation, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack."

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

The charges are for disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. Each charge carries a sentence of 4 years probation.

As we all know by now, Smollett said he was attacked outside his Chicago hotel on January 29th by two men who he said poured a chemical on him and yelled racial and anti-gay slurs at him. He said they wore red MAGA hats.

It turned out, after weeks of back and forth, that he’d staged the attack himself, including put a noose around his neck. Earlier, he’d sent a threatening letter to himself at the “Empire” studio which he thought no one took seriously.

The motive, it’s alleged, was money. Smollett didn’t think he was being paid enough for “Empire.”

Ironically, it was “Empire” creator Lee Daniels and Danny Strong who were first to jump to Smollett’s defense after the attack. Their level of shock and disappointment must be very high.

Smollett, 29, had everything: a hit acting career, a singing career that he was launching, and hot prospects post-Empire. It remains a mystery how he self-destructed. It will be very hard for him to re-establish a career. “Empire” is in the process of writing him out of the show now.

Smollett has pleaded not guilty to all charges and posted a $100,000 bond to be released."

Update 3/9/2019: Smollett's lawyer Mark Geragos gave the following statement in response to the actor's indictment:

""The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.""

3/8/2019:Empire star Jussie Smollett will be going into the weekend with a legal anvil hanging over his head. According to CBS Chicago, the actor was indicted Friday by a grand jury with 16 felony counts of filing a false police report, after reportedly faking a hate crime in January.

The indictment means that Chicago police presented the grand jury with enough evidence to try Smollett for the 16 charges. The actor will be arraigned Friday, March 14, to formally hear the charges and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.

According to the indictment, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 29, one of whom was wearing a mask. His family later called the incident ""a racial and homophobic hate crime."" However, the investigation led by Chicago police led to two Nigerian brothers who claimed that Smollett paid for the attack with a check. Police claim Smollett orchestrated the attack due to disgruntlement with his Empire paycheck; the actor has denied those accusations.

Smollett has been written out of the rest of Empire's fifth season, which is currently airing on Fox. The studio that produces the series declined to comment on Smollett's indictment."

An attorney for Jussie Smollett says a 16-count indictment against the ""Empire"" actor is ""vindictive"" and Smollett ""maintains his innocence.""

Mark Geragos says in a statement that he did not expect a Cook County grand jury would charge Smollet with 16 separate counts and the indictment is ""prosecutorial overkill.""

He says the indictment ""is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy.""

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for making a false report of an attack on him in Chicago. Police say Smollett staged the attack and recruited two brothers to participate. Local media have reported that the Chicago Police Department is investigating leaks to reporters during the investigation of the reported attack.

5:30 p.m.

The16-county grand jury indictment of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett relates to allegations that he lied to police about a reported attack in January - eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker's eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack.

New reports claim the actor has been indicted on nearly 20 felony counts connected to his recent Chicago hate crime attack.

According to reports, Jussie is getting hit with the criminal charges for allegedly filing false reports of a crime.

The indictment charges Smollett with 16 counts of disorderly conduct. Smollett’s attorneys said they have no statement at this time. He remains out on bail pending an arraignment Thursday. The counts in the indictment obtained by CNN say Smollett gave statements to a Chicago police officer after the incident and to a detective. Details in some of those statements were different, the indictment says. (CNN)

Recently, rap star Drake‘s dad Dennis Graham spoke up for Smollett amid his publicized attack and rumors suggesting he might have staged it.

“Jussie has been misunderstood. As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.” (Variety)

According to reports, Jussie’s Jamal Lyon character will noticeably disappear from the upcoming season’s final episodes.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” said EPs Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer in a statement this morning in reference to the supposed assault of January 29 and the subsequent legal fallout. “Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,” the producers added. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.” (Deadline)

After turning himself in last month, Smollett posted bond and will return to court next week."

Smollett has been specifically accused of making “false report of offense,” according to CBS Chicago. He will be arraigned on March 14.

The sixteen charges in the indictment correspond with statements Smollett made to police that prosecutors allege were false, including describing the acts committed during the attack such as the yelled slurs and pouring of bleach.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time…there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” the indictment reads.

Smollett was charged last month with disorderly conduct, with police accusing him of falsifying a report that he was attacked in the early hours of Jan. 29 in Chicago.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, claimed he was attacked in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood by two masked men, one of whom was wearing a red hat, during the early morning hours of Jan. 29 while talking on the phone with his manager.

Smollett said the men shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, put a noose around his neck, and poured a chemical believed to be bleach on him. Smollett’s manager, Brandon Moore, claimed that he heard the attackers calling Smollett “Empire faggot [racial expletive]” and shouting “This is MAGA country!”

At the time of his arrest, Chicago police accused Smollett of staging the attack because he was unhappy with his Empire salary.

Smollett has since been suspended from the Fox drama, and won’t appear in the final two episodes of season five.

The actor’s legal team has yet to make a statement on the indictment against him, but in February issued a statement declaring his innocence and claiming Chicago police engaged in “an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election,” the statement reads. “Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Earlier this month, Good Morning America host Robin Roberts called her interview with Smollett after he reported the attack a “no-win situation.”

Roberts interviewed Smollett on February 14, one week before the actor was formally charged with disorderly conduct and accused of staging the attack.

Discussing whether she should have been more aggressive in her questioning, Roberts said: “I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man. He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother.’ If I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.’”

Roberts added that it was “a no-win situation for me.”

“I pride myself in being fair,” she continued. “I know how much work went into being balanced about what had happened and to challenge him on certain things.”"

According to Chicago's ABC7,

He was previously charged on 20 February with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

The actor told police in January he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two masked men, apparently Donald Trump supporters, who wrapped rope around his neck and poured an unknown substance on him.

Police say Smollett hired the men - brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo - to stage the incident because he was upset with what he was being paid to appear on Empire.

He has since been axed from the final two episodes of the current season.

Smollett - who handed himself into police after the allegation was made - denies playing a role in the attack, which he claimed had left him ""forever changed"".

During a tearful appearance on Good Morning America, he also said he was angry that people had doubted his story and suggested the disbelief might be because of racial bias.

His lawyer Mark Geragos said the indictment was ""vindictive"" and ""prosecutorial overkill"".

CHICAGO -- A grand jury in Chicago indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" He said Smollett ""adamantly maintains his innocence.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,"" Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett's account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett's bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had ""no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.""

Since Smollett's arrest, the producers of ""Empire"" announced that the actor's character would be removed from the season's final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces ""Empire"" had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the Fox network hip-hop drama Empire, was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with lying to police about a supposed racist and homophobic attack by supporters of President Donald Trump.

Neither Smollett's lawyer nor his spokeswoman could immediately be reached for comment on the latest charges.

At the time he was initially charged, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett had paid two brothers $US3,500 ($A5,000) to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

Smollett, 36, was arrested and later released on $US100,000 bond two weeks ago in connection with the initial charge against him.

The indictment, returned by a grand jury on Thursday, charges Smollett with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging that he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators. A copy of the document was furnished to Reuters by a Cook County Circuit Court clerk on Friday.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett's story, he reported that two masked men approached him on a darkened street January 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

Smollett also told police, according to authorities, that the attackers had yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Smollett took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police had said.

News of the purported assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

His lawyers last month said they were conducting a thorough investigation for the purposes of mounting a defence of the actor."

ADVERTISEMENT

The Cook County State’s Attorney charged Smollett on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett told police in late January that he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor said the men shouted at him, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police said Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

After an investigation, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

The Black Bears will take a 5-26 record into an America East quarterfinal at top-seeded Vermont (24-6) at 7 p.m. Saturday.

That’s one fewer win in Coach Richard Barron’s first season than Maine had last year under Bob Walsh, and on a par with Walsh’s four-year mark of 24-100.

But those close to the program have seen growth this season. There have been fewer blowout losses. Fourteen losses have been by less than 10 points, three in overtime. The overhauled roster is expected to be stronger next season under Barron, the former UMaine women’s coach.

“We’re not missing great plays or talent,” Barron said. “What we’re missing is discipline just to do the simple things over and over.”

In Tuesday’s 60-53 loss at New Hampshire, that translated into Maine defenders continually trying to double-team the high post, which opened up UNH’s 3-point shooters. Maine’s nine-point lead with eight minutes to play disappeared rapidly.

“We’re not a very mature team. Regardless of our age, everybody is new in this system,” Barron said.

It didn’t help that Maine was without its leading scorer and rebounder, injured junior forward Andrew Fleming, a former Oxford Hills standout who was named to the America East all-conference second team Friday.

Fleming broke his arm and suffered a concussion after a terrifying fall when he was fouled from behind on a breakaway dunk Feb. 23 at Stony Brook.

Fleming was asked what Maine needs to take the next step and turn late-game leads into wins.

“I think we’ve taken it. You might not see it necessarily this year,” he said. “We’re getting really close. We’re doing much better than last year. We’ve held leads for the majority of the game. We’ve just got to keep working and keep growing.”

One reason for optimism is some of the talent influx is already on a roster that includes players from 12 countries and five continents.

Mykhailo Yagodin, a 6-foot-5 sophomore guard from Odessa, Ukraine, who Barron called “maybe our best scorer, our best shooter,” tore his ACL in the opener at Denver. Solomon Iluyomade, a 6-7 sophomore forward from London, also suffered a season-ending injury in that game. Redshirt freshman Stephane Ingo, a 6-9 center from Canada with a 7-3 wingspan, and 6-8 Nedeljko Prijovic, who had to sit out a season after transferring from Texas State, practiced with the Black Bears all season and will be in the mix next winter.

“I can’t wait to be a part of it,” said freshman point guard Terion Moss of Portland. “Next year we should be really strong. We’ve got incoming players, and really good ones, so it’s going to be a good rebuilding team.”

Maine will return its top five in terms of minutes per game: Fleming (averaging 13.8 points and 7 rebounds), junior guard Isaiah White (13.3 points), junior guard Sergio El Darwich (10.5), sophomore forward Vilgot Larsson (6.9), and Moss (5.6), who started 14 of 28 games, missing three with a concussion.

Add in three more international recruits who committed during the early signing period and Barron believes the level of competition will go up – during games and practices.

“We’re going to have seven new players next year that aren’t playing this year,” he said. “So for everybody who’s getting minutes this year there’s going to be more competition, more size, more talent on the roster, competing for those minutes.”

Under Walsh, Maine’s roster continuity was disrupted by players transferring out of the program.

Barron said he expects all of his potential returnees to stay in Orono.

“I wouldn’t have recruited them otherwise,” he said. “You can’t turn people over every single year. We’re going to win with a system, and in order for a system to be successful, you’ve got to have guys in the system for years to understand it.”

NOTES: Vermont has won 20-plus games for 11 straight years. Vermont beat Maine 73-49 in Orono and 86-63 in Burlington in the regular season. At Vermont, America East Player of the Year Anthony Lamb and first-team guard Ernie Duncan combined for 50 points as Vermont made 11 first-half 3-pointers. … Prior to Fleming, the last Maine second-team all-conference player was 2012-13 – Justin Edwards and Alasdair Fraser. Edward Little product Troy Barnies was the last Black Bear first-team choice in 2010-11 when Maine went 15-15, its last non-losing season.

The indictment charges Smollett with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

Smollett’s attorneys said they have no statement at this time. He remains out on bail pending an arraignment Thursday.

Smollett reported to police in January that he had been attacked in Chicago in an incident that ended with a noose around his neck. Police initially investigated the case as a possible hate crime.

The counts in the indictment obtained by CNN say Smollett gave statements to a Chicago police officer after the incident and to a detective. Details in some of those statements were different, the indictment says.

After police detained two brothers who were “persons of interest” in mid-February, police sources revealed that authorities suspected Smollett knew the men and allegedly had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. The men were released without being charged.

Smollett has denied any involvement in orchestrating an attack.

Smollett was charged in February with felony disorderly conduct. The judge granted a $100,000 bail, and Smollett paid a $10,000 bond. He was ordered to give up his passport and will remain under supervision until his case is adjudicated.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,” Smollett’s attorneys said in February.

The subsection of the Illinois law states: “A person commits disorderly conduct when he or she knowingly … (4) Transmits or causes to be transmitted in any manner to any peace officer, public officer or public employee a report to the effect that an offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed, knowing at the time of the transmission that there is no reasonable ground for believing that the offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed.”

The producers behind “Empire” decided to remove Smollett’s character, Jamal, from the final two episodes of the season. The decision was made to “avoid further disruption on set,” producers said.

A spokesperson for Fox said Friday the company has no comment."

CHICAGO - The Latest on the indictment of actor Jussie Smollett (all times local):

9:30 p.m.

An attorney for Jussie Smollett says a 16-count indictment against the ""Empire"" actor is ""vindictive"" and Smollett ""maintains his innocence.""

Mark Geragos says in a statement that he did not expect a Cook County grand jury would charge Smollet with 16 separate counts and the indictment is ""prosecutorial overkill.""

He says the indictment ""is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy.""

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for making a false report of an attack on him in Chicago. Police say Smollett staged the attack and recruited two brothers to participate. Local media have reported that the Chicago Police Department is investigating leaks to reporters during the investigation of the reported attack.

5:30 p.m.

The16-county grand jury indictment of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett relates to allegations that he lied to police about a reported attack in January — eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker's eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack.

A grand jury in Chicago has indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment filed Thursday charges him with falsely reporting an offence.

Smollett was charged on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett, who is black and gay, told police in late January that he was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago who wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police say Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as ""redundant and vindictive,"" adding that his client ""adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.""

He also said that leveling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defense cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $35,000 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

No further arrest

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on February 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week's indictment ""because it's the same case,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett's claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett's story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of January 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on February 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor's defense.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologized last month to the cast and crew on the set of ""Empire"" but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, ""to distract from the internal investigation.""

""Empire"" debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show's current season."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Television actor Jussie Smollett, arrested last month on a single charge of perpetrating a hate-crime hoax, has been newly indicted on 16 felony counts of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two strangers shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 (£18,995) fine.

The Empire actor was initially charged last month with one count of disorderly conduct related to the accusation that he falsely reported that he had been physically attacked on Jan. 29 by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

The expanded charges focus on the allegedly false statements he made to two Chicago police officers about the incident.

According to Chicago's ABC7,

""The new set of charges each carry a possible sentence of probation to four years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.""

Chicago police say that Smollett staged the attack to advance his career.

CHICAGO (AP) — The Latest on the indictment of actor Jussie Smollett (all times local):

9:30 p.m.

An attorney for Jussie Smollett says a 16-count indictment against the “Empire” actor is “vindictive” and Smollett “maintains his innocence.”

Mark Geragos says in a statement that he did not expect a Cook County grand jury would charge Smollet with 16 separate counts and the indictment is “prosecutorial overkill.”

He says the indictment “is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy.”

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for making a false report of an attack on him in Chicago. Police say Smollett staged the attack and recruited two brothers to participate. Local media have reported that the Chicago Police Department is investigating leaks to reporters during the investigation of the reported attack.

The16-county grand jury indictment of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett relates to allegations that he lied to police about a reported attack in January — eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker’s eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack.

The multiple counts highlight different aspects of Smollett’s allegedly phony story, including claims that his attackers beat him, poured a chemical substance on him and put a rope around his neck.

The indictment comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors charged Smollett with a single felony count and he was released from Cook County Jail after a friend posted his $100,000 bond.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in the Leighton Criminal Court Building on Thursday so a judge can be assigned to preside over his case and he can plead not guilty to the 16 counts.

The actor, 36, is accused of staging a phony attack on himself, then telling police he was the victim of a hate crime.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, has said he was walking from a Subway sandwich shop to his apartment in downtown Chicago around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 when two men walked up, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him and wrapped a noose around his neck.

Smollett said they also yelled “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Trump’s campaign slogan of “Make America Great Again.”

Police initially treated the incident as a hate crime, but their focus turned to Smollett after two brothers who were alleged to have been his attackers told police that Smollett had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack – with a promise of another $500 later.

Police pieced together much of their evidence by reviewing footage from about 55 police and private surveillance cameras showing the brothers’ movements before and after the attack.

The shift in the investigation came amid often bitter public debate and stinging skepticism on social media – doubts that Smollett addressed in a national TV interview and in a strongly worded statement after the brothers were released from custody after questioning by police.

A week before the alleged attack, Smollett told police he received a threatening letter at work. Witnesses told police a postal worker dropped off the letter at the Chicago studio where “Empire” is filmed. It was postmarked in Bedford Park, a southwest Chicago suburb, on Jan. 18 and bore two American flag stamps. The letters “MAGA” were handwritten in the upper left corner of the envelope.

Prosecutors said Smollett staged the attack because he was unhappy with the studio’s response to the threatening letter. Chicago police took it a step further, accusing Smollett of faking the letter as well.

The letter is the subject of a separate federal investigation.

On Feb. 21, the day Smollett was initially charged, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson blasted the actor, saying the hoax dragged “Chicago’s reputation through the mud.”
