Police dispute),"['John Sexton', 'Ed Morrissey', 'Jazz Shaw', 'Karen Townsend']",https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Smollett-case.jpg,"['smollett', 'update', 'alleged', 'persons', 'jussie', 'interest', 'case', 'source', 'chicago', 'attack', 'staged', 'men', 'investigaton', 'developments', 'dispute', 'sources']","I haven’t been paying close attention to this case, more like watching it happen in the background. But today appears to be a big day with some major developments. For a start, Jussie Smollett appeared on TV this morning to talk about the alleged attack, the first time he’s done so. He said, among other things, that he believes the two men shown in a grainy image released by police last month could be the two who attacked him. He also lashed out at his critics for doubting his story (video below).

In addition to Smollett’s TV appearance today, there also seems to be some action on the case. Police revealed earlier that they have now identified two persons of interest in the case. The persons of interest have not been identified by name but the police seem to be saying they are the same people seen in the surveillance photo. Note this first tweet says police have identified “the persons of interest” which is what they called the men in the photo when it was released last month:

Important for media reporting: The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported. They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim. pic.twitter.com/JuH1kYRTYV — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 14, 2019

So who are these persons of interest? That’s where this gets weird. TMZ claims one is an actor who has appeared on Empire with Smollett before:

…officers are also talking to another man, an actor who has also appeared on “Empire”… Another man who was with the actor at O’Hare was also taken in for questioning… As for how cops ID’d the 2 people they’re questioning — we’re told they used rideshare and/or taxicab records to track their locations the night of the alleged incident.

TMZ isn’t always the most reliable source but the Chicago Tribune is apparently hearing the same thing:

A law enforcement source said the two men were brought in for questioning Wednesday night from O’Hare International Airport. One of them worked on “Empire,” the source said… Guglielmi said the two men — who sources say are both black — were tracked down “through meticulous investigation.” Guglielmi released no other details, but a source familiar with the investigation said one of the men was traced through his use of a ride-share service.

Why would a fellow actor, someone Smollett knows, attack him on the street in the middle of the night? And let’s not skip over the elephant in the room. If someone described this attack to you, i.e. a man ranting about “MAGA country” and hanging a noose on someone, is there any chance you’d suspect the attacker was black? To say that doesn’t fit the profile of who I could imagine committing this alleged crime would be an understatement.

Of course, it’s possible the two guys police are talking to are the two guys in the photo but had nothing to do with the alleged attack. That would be quite a coincidence. This wasn’t the middle of the day on a crowded street. It was late at night and freezing outside. Why would these guys have taken an Uber to this part of town just to walk around in the cold? No doubt that’s one of the things Chicago PD are asking them today.

Lots of unanswered questions but it seems police have made some progress if they’ve identified the two men in the photo. Hopefully, we’ll have an update on this before the week is out. One thing is certain: This story is too high profile for it to fade away at this point. Here’s a portion of Smollett’s interview from this morning.

Update: This hasn’t been confirmed by authorities yet but Chicago reporter Rob Elgas says sources are telling ABC 7 the attack was staged and that Smollett ducked a police interview this morning.

And here’s more from the same reporter:

MORE: One of those persons of interest has appeared on Empire.

Smollett is also being questioned by police. Chicago police have no new comment. No one has been charged. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) February 14, 2019

Apparently, police found something during the search:

The major development is the tweet at the top of this update. Let’s see if police confirm all of this.

And here’s another reporter hearing the same, this time with a quote:

So what about the sources talking to CBS Chicago?

Update: Here’s a report from ABC 7:"
1,https://www.dailywire.com/news/43509/police-question-two-persons-interest-smollett-case-hank-berrien,,Police Question Two ‘Persons Of Interest’ In Smollett Case; One Worked On ‘Empire’,[],https://www.dailywire.com/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/uploads/2019/02/jussie_smollett_gi_2.jpg?itok=n5JY30ZN,"['smollett', 'persons', 'case', 'interest', 'worked', 'empire', 'truth', 'reports', 'chicago', 'records', 'really', 'attack', 'dont', 'men', 'phone', 'question']","According to multiple reports, on Thursday Chicago police questioned two “persons of interest” in the investigation into the alleged attack on actor and singer Jussie Smollett, best known for his role on Fox’s “Empire.” One of the men reportedly worked with Smollett on the show.

CWB Chicago reports that police say the two men were detained at O’Hare airport on Wednesday night and taken in for questioning. CWB Chicago speculates that Chicago police may have known for a week that the attack on Smollett was staged and who initiated the attack. The Chicago Tribune reports that police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the two men “are not considered suspects at this time.”

According to TMZ, “Chicago PD has confirmed … the 2 men taken in for questioning are the same men in the surveillance video screen grab. The PD confirms transportation records, along with interviews with Jussie and other witnesses, led to the ID of the 2 men.”

“Sources connected to the case tell us the actor, not Jussie, was picked up by Chicago PD Wednesday night right after he flew into O’Hare Airport,” TMZ reported Thursday. “We’re told Jussie was brought in Thursday morning for additional questioning. Another man who was with the actor at O’Hare was also taken in for questioning.”

TMZ notes that police used “rideshare and/or taxicab records” to identify the two persons of interest and track them the night Smollett was attacked.

Guglielmi, Chicago Police Department’s chief spokesperson, has said that the “heavily redacted” phone records from the night of the attack that were submitted by Smollett to the police this week were not sufficient to meet the burden of a criminal investigation. However, according to CWB Chicago, “investigators have already received Smollett’s complete phone records via a subpoena served on his service provider.”

CWB Chicago quotes one source who claims that before he provided police with his phone records, Smollett downloaded his calls on a spreadsheet and then deleted certain phone calls. “He did the job for them because then they only had to focus on the numbers he deleted,” the source told the outlet.

As the Tribune reported, when he appeared on “Good Morning America” on Thursday, Smollett said that the two men from the grainy video were his attackers. In response to host Robin Roberts asking how he was sure, he said, “Cause … I was there. For me, when that was released, I was like, ‘OK, we’re getting somewhere,’ you know what I’m saying? So, yeah, I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

Deadline noted that Smollett also claimed he was attacked because he is outspoken against President Trump. Smollett stated, “I come really, really hard against 45. I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

When Smollett stated, “I’m pissed off,” host Robin Roberts asked, “What is it that has you so angry? Is it the attackers?”

“It’s the attackers,” he responded. “It’s also the attacks. It’s like, at first it was a thing of like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth , that’s it, cause it’s truth.’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, How can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth.’ And then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth; you don’t even want to see the truth.’’”

Referencing his claim that the attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” Smollett said, “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t. They called me a n*****. There’s no which way you cut it, I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on a racist sundae.”

When Roberts asked him why he waited 30 minutes before he alerted police, Smollett replied, “There’s a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you’re somehow considered to be weak, and I’m not weak, and we as a people are not weak.”

UPDATE: Multiple reports say police are now investigating whether the attack was “staged.”"

Police reported that the Empire star was called racial and homophobic slurs before being beaten by the assailants. An “unknown substance” was poured on Smollett and a noose tied around his neck before the attackers made their escape. The report suggests that Smollett’s celebrity status partially motivated the attack because the assailants recognized Smollett from his role on Empire. Smollett, who came out as gay in 2015 when his character Jamal Lyons did on Empire, is one of the most visible members of the LGBTQ community in current American culture.

Police said they recovered video footage and released photos of possible persons of interest in the attack. While an outpouring of support for Smollett erupted on social media, skeptics have thrown doubt across the actor and activist’s story, claiming certain facts don’t add up. Smollett addressed the “doubters” on Thursday in an interview with Good Morning America, stating that it’s ""not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.”

Doubting that a hate crime could happen reflects the general ignorance of the daily violence queer and trans people of color face and endure every day. Nuanced and existing at a myriad of different intersections, the attack on Smollett represents a unique form of racialized queerphobia that impacts QTPOC. Seeing a Black body terrorized because of race and sexual orientation is an all too familiar scene to the QTPOC community, which is why accepting it as reality wasn’t a problem for us when it seemed difficult for those doubters to believe.

While Smollett’s celebrity status was more than likely a factor in his assailants targeting him, his cultural capital and his access to power and money make him one of the rare QTPOC whose attacks are reported and investigated. Violence against queer and trans people of color occurs at alarming rates yet numbers suggest that because of a lack of trust in law enforcement, many LGBTQ people don’t report hate crimes to the police. Studies also show that LGBTQ people experience high levels of harassment and discrimination from police officers and law enforcement. When taking into account race, those numbers are compounded. This may be why Smollett was reluctant to report his attack in the first place. Furthermore, there is a lack of numerical and statistical research specifically addressing the unique violence and racism that QTPOC face, even within the larger queer and trans community.

Some would argue visibility and fame don’t protect black and brown bodies in the ways that those things offer shields for white bodies. “Contrary to popular belief, visibility does not protect us,” wrote black and queer civil rights activist, writer, and scholar Preston Mitchum in a piece for The Advocate addressing the attack. “And [visibility] may exacerbate harm, not curtail it.”

While Mitchum’s observations ring true, Smollett’s visibility is what makes him a figure to stand behind and to stand in solidarity with. QTPOC aren’t made visible and this lack of visibility has direct impacts on our health and well-being. Even in films centered around QTPOC, like Stonewall for example, the plots so often revolve around a white protagonist while simultaneously erasing QTPOC.

In a 2018 interview with Self, Laverne Cox addresses a feeling of survivor’s guilt knowing she’s found success while so many others like her struggle. “I understand that I’m very lucky,” she said. “I understand that I’ve been chosen. It makes me sad... it’s very intense.” This epitomizes the privileges of fame and social capital. Cox, who gained attention from her role in Orange Is The New Black, became a visible spokesperson for QTPOC, much like Jussie Smollett did when he revealed his queer identity. “The month I was on the cover of TIME magazine, five trans women were killed,” Cox said in another interview with The Cut. The juxtaposition of her fame with the darkness of the reality of trans existence is a grim awakening of the ways visibility can provide a shield from violence.

Smollett’s attack was horrendous, but we can still acknowledge that there are many more QTPOC whose stories are not splashed across the landing pages of websites, whose names are not hashtags or trending topics on Twitter. We can still acknowledge that what happened to Smollett was wrong while holding our culture accountable for the ways in which it silences and erases QTPOC who aren’t famous, specifically Black trans women who are killed at the highest rates in the QTPOC community. We can still condemn Smollett’s attackers, while acknowledging that being a cis man comes with privileges in our culture—privileges that trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people of color don’t experience.

There’s no doubt that the outrage over Smollett is a good thing. The visibility is a good thing. But the cavalry of celebrities and fans with decent intentions who are upset by Smollett’s attack should seek to galvanize in similar ways when other QTPOC face violence, hate, and discrimination. Waiting for the invisible to be made visible through a body with celebrity status means that many more of us are harmed, and die, in silence.

The homes of the “persons of interest” in the Jussie Smollett case have been raided by Chicago Police Department officers. CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar reports that both men have appeared as extras in “Empire” and are of Nigerian descent. De Mar tweeted that the men’s home was “ransacked.” A family member told De Mar that they believe the pair have been identified by police as persons of interest because they left for Nigeria on the day of the attack.

The two men are the same two men who were featured in the grainy pictures that was released by the Chicago Police Department.

Jussie Smollett 'pissed off' after alleged attackThe ""Empire"" star spoke to ABC News' Robin Roberts in his first interview since being attacked on Jan. 29 in what is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

On the same day as the raid, “Good Morning America” aired an interview with Smollett in which the singer and actor said, “I want to believe, with everything that has happened, that there is something called justice.” Smollett also said that he did not know if he would be able to heal if his assailants were not found.

A lawyer for the men who have been taken into custody has told Charlie De Mar that she has spoken to her clients. On January 29, Smollett told police in Chicago that he had been assaulted while leaving a Subway restaurant, close to the actor’s apartment on North Lower Water Street around 2 a.m. The “Empire” actor described his assailants as being clad in black and wearing ski masks. TMZ was the first report that Smollett told cops his attackers referred to him as a “n*****” and a “f*****.” The gossip site also said that Smollett told officers his attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country” during the alleged assault. Smollett did not mention the “MAGA” remarks in an initial statement but did tell police about those remarks in a subsequent statement. Smollett is openly gay.

Smollett’s manager, Brandon Z. Moore, told police that he was on the phone with the actor when the attack took place. Moore says he heard the men shout, “This is MAGA country.” as well as a racial slur. Police later said that the phone records that Smollett provided to prove this phone call took place were deemed as insufficient.

TMZ was the first to report that Chicago cops had picked up two men on the night of February 14 at O’Hare Airport in relation to the Smollett assault. That article only referred to one of the suspects as having appeared in “Empire.”

Now streaming on Netflix, the action-packed film follows four black Vietnam War veterans—Paul (Delroy Lindo), Otis (Clarke Peters), Eddie (Norm Lewis), and Melvin (Isiah Whitlock, Jr.)— as they reunite at the Ho Chi Minh City Hotel and embark on a mission to bring home the remains of their fallen brother and squad leader Norman (Chadwick Boseman) along with a golden hidden treasure secured for them.

Based on an original screenplay by Danny Bilson and Paul DeMeo, Da 5 Bloods touches on the realities many Black Vietnam veterans of the '70s experienced upon their return home of civil injustice—from post-traumatic stress disorder to systemic racism to being called “baby killers” despite being drafted by the U.S. military against their will.

Lee and his production company 40 Acres and a Mule joined forces with fellow scriber Kevin Willmott (BlacKkKlansman), composer Terence Blanchard (BlacKkKlansman), and Netflix producers Lloyd Levin, Beatriz Levin, Jon Kilik to bring the Da 5 Bloods to life.

Ahead of the film's premiere, VIBE correspondent/host Jazzie Belle sat down with Lee and the cast—including Jonathan Majors who plays Lindo’s son, David— to discuss the uncomfortable significance of the MAGA hat, the deep-seated brotherly love between their characters, and what they hope viewers can take away from the film.

""Communicate with each other. This movie is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Whitlock, Jr. ""Hope. Learn your history and hope,"" added Lewis. ""Make sure this isn't just one chapter of your history that you know,"" pointed out Peters. ""Now, use this as the portal to everything else over the past hundred years, the good and the bad. The successes of the scientists, the mathematicians, the inventors, as well as the atrocities. There's a huge disparity in all of that stuff. And America would not be America without us.""

On whether the constant telling or our Black stories in films is retraumatizing or cathartic

Lee: It's a combination of both. It's not one or the other. As Black people, we go through some sh*t, good and bad. (laughs) It's hard, but here's the thing though. It's been hard from day one. 1619, our ancestors. That first ship landed in Jamestown, Virginia. It's never been easier. It's been getting easier, you might say, but it's never been easy from the get-go.

On whether Kanye's support of Donald Trump and the MAGA hat

Lee: This really had nothing to do with our brother. I mean he's not the only one that has drunk from the orange pitcher of Kool-aid. There's a very small percentage. We point out that Black guy's behind Trump at every rally hold up a sign [saying] ""Black for Kanye,"" so it's not just our brother Kanye...and also story-wise, character-wise, it really injects some tension between [the people of] the group. Because when you're in a war with somebody, that bond is like that. It's going to take some really extra stuff to see an issue come up where they're not on the same page.

On whether who has become more woke in the midst of today's protests

Lee: I think we've been woke as the new terminology is. I think what's happening is our white brothers and sisters are getting woke. I think that's the biggest difference. L.A. is a great great great example of that....and that's always been a thing. In many of our great writers [like] James Baldwin and I can't name them all, have said it is not the responsibility of black people to fix racism. That don't make no goddamn sense.

Delroy Lindo and Jonathan Majors

On the apprehension behind associating the MAGA hat with his character in the film

Lindo: The Trumpian piece, that was the only piece I was hesitant about. It was never, ""Spike, I don't want to play this part."" It was always about, for my initial response was, ""Spike, can we change this? Can we change that aspect? Can I be a conservative? Can I be an arch-conservative?"" I don't want to be this with that hat and all. And Spike needed it. Ultimately, he needed that component I'm the film. I respected that and I was able to get past it. It was never a question of me not wanting to be a part of this because I absolutely did. I just wanted initially to change that component. In retrospect, that component needed to be there. There were certain times when it was quite uncomfortable, but once I rationalized it in my head, it was a part of what was a number of other parts in the characteristics of this character that were brilliant to negotiate and engage.

On the lesson learned while working on set with Lee and the cast

Majors: It was a moment of listening, of being very quiet and listening and also knowing your cue and knowing when there is a void here for whatever reason. And usually, when you look around and say something is missing, it's because you're the one that's supposed to be feeling that. What I gathered from listening, was a great deal of experience. It's so interesting as an actor because we feel things and so to be opposite people who are also feelers, who also really, really, throw punches—no one's pulling punches, when they say it, they mean it. And to listen and feel that then and then go, ""There's the void. Oh, my turn,"" boom The confidence after leaving this project...I left this project and then went to work on my TV show. I had just come from wrestling and working and training at one of the toughest gyms in cinema. I was like, ""Oh, let's go. I'm ready for this.""

Norm Lewis, Clarke Peters, and Isiah Whitlock Jr.

On the importance of seeing camaraderie among Black men on film

Peters: I think it's extremely important. It is as important as you breathing. If Black men don't try to find a way to love each other, we might as well go ahead and give ourselves up, really. Because I grew up in the '60s where there was this ""flower power"" peace love kind of thing, that has stayed within me, you know? I love these brothers off the film as well. I think that it is important for the youth to see that and for the older brother to be reminded of that because they were doing it back in the day themselves, they just forgot. Don't let this world stifle your love.

On how different it was to work with Spike Lee on this film versus the others

Whitlock Jr.: This is about the 6th film I've done with Spike, so I've gotten to know Spike. I know how he works. I've grown comfortable working with him. I don't bring the anxiety like I brought with the first couple of films. I'll never forget when I first started working with him, he said: ""You just gotta relax and do your thing."" When he walked away, I said to myself, ""Do my thing. I didn't even know I had a thing."" (laughs) But I better find it quickly. Well, I found my thing and I keep doing my thing. Basically what he was saying was look, just be yourself and bring that quality to the film which is why you're here. I love working with him, I hope it's not the last time.

On how he landed the role as Eddie after Spike shared the film's script with him

Lewis: I stay up until four in the morning, reading the script. He called me the next day and said, ""Let's go have dinner."" We had dinner, talked about the script. Still no offer or anything like that. He's like, ""What do you think?"" I loved the script. I said, ""It's great. Congratulations, I hope that this goes forward."" (laughs) And then he said, ""What do you think about Eddie?""... ""Eddie's a great character. Listen, congratulations. Keep going forward, I hope this works for you."" He says, ""I want you to play Eddie."" Oh, thank God. There was some point to this whole thing and so from that, it was just so exciting and getting to know I was going to do a Spike Lee joint. Reading the script and [knowing] that it was a departure from what he had done before. I mean there's still a lot of the same elements, being that it's an action-packed film. The fact that I was going to go to Thailand and do this...all these great people that I'd admired for years. It was just brilliant.

Ever wondered why we never see a big ol’ toothy-grin from Kim Kardashian? Well, now she’s revealed exactly why she doesn’t smile.

Kim told fans why she chooses not to smile when taking photos during a masterclass with her pal and make up artist Mario Dedivanovic and actually, it’s pretty genius (even if it is a little bit sad).

According to Glamour, the reality star was asked how she maintains her flawless complexion and she replied: ‘Don’t smile.’

That’s one cost-free way to avoid the wrinkles.

That might not be the only reason, however, as Kim has previously said she prefers the straight-faced look on Instagram now, after being subjected to a lot of hate from trolls about the way she looks.

Kim said refusing to smile keeps her flawless complexion, but it’s also a secret dig at her trolls (Picture: FilmMagic)

She explained in an interview with C magazine that actually she doesn’t want to smile in pictures now because of the negative comments that were thrown her way during her first pregnancy with daughter North, now five.

Kim had struggled with preeclampsia and suffered a barrage of online abuse over her bloating.

She said: ‘It changed the way I viewed wanting my picture taken, after I had the baby, I was like, “these are the same people that made fun of me,” I didn’t want to smile for them.’

Kim, meanwhile, has also been setting the record straight on rumours she has had a secret nose job.

Kim and Kanye are expecting baby number four via surrogate (Picture: Getty Images)

Speaking at the masterclass, the mum-of-three insisted that her nose really is her, having kids has just brought out her features.

She said: ‘I never had my nose done. Everyone thought I did, and I said wait until you have kids because your real features come out.’

Kim shares daughter North, son Saint, three, and baby Chicago, one, with husband Kanye West.

The couple recently announced they are expecting their fourth child via surrogate and Kim has said she is hoping for ‘balance’ when their new addition arrives.

‘I felt the huge change between one to two – that felt like one to 20 – that was harder than two to three for me,’ Kim told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.

Smollett is also being re-questioned. The twist: According to reports, Smollett may know the men involved in the altercation.

The persons of interest were arrested at O’Hare airport on Wednesday night, police said. Smollett said in an interview aired on Good Morning America today that he believed the two persons of interest seen in the CPD images were the persons who attacked him. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.” TMZ reported that the persons of interest are an actor who has appeared with Smollett on Fox television’s Empire and a person who was traveling with the second actor. These individuals are believed to be the “potential persons of interest” who were seen in low-quality images released by Chicago police days after the alleged attack, according to a police spokesperson. TMZ also reported that police used “rideshare and/or taxicab records” to identify the “persons of interest” and to track their movements on the night of the purported attack.

CWB Chicago reports a tip they received a week ago that the identities of the men on camera, the same men Smollett identified as his attackers, were already known to police before Smollett fingered them.

Smollett had also turned over phone records on a spreadsheet, with several numbers deleted, that police then compared to a full list of phone records. They were then able to identify numbers of interest based on what Smollett had deleted.

A source familiar with the records provided by the Empire star states that Smollett downloaded his phone activity into a spreadsheet and then deleted certain phone calls before handing over the records. “He did the [detectives’] job for them because then they only had to focus on the numbers he deleted.”

Mediaite’s John Zeigler reports another as-yet-uncorroborated piece of information he says was gleaned from insiders working the case:

According to Chicago police, the two ""persons of interest"" on a grainy and blurry surveillance video from the night of the attack have been found and they are being interviewed in the investigation.

One is an ""extra"" actor from the ""Empire"" show, and the other is his friend.

According to a report from WGN-Chicago, the two persons being interviewed by Chicago police are African-American.

Rafer Wiegel of Fox 32 reported that police said the pair were picked up at O'Hare airport on Wednesday and that they were the persons in the grainy surveillance footage.

He also added that the police are not calling them suspects yet.



""These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned,"" the police said. ""Investigation continues.""

The two persons of interest and Smollett are being interviewed by the police after the new development.

Smollett, who is a frequent guest on the progressive cable news network MSNBC, claimed that he was assaulted by two men who were yelling racist and homophobic taunts at him. In a second interview with police he said that they yelled, ""this is MAGA country!"" at him, referring to the president's campaign motto, ""Make America Great Again.""

Some have cast doubt on his claims while noting some inconsistencies in his story.

Smollett angrily denounced those expressing skepticism in his story during an interview with ABC News Wednesday.

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area at the time Smollett said he was attacked, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck at about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi told The Associated Press that the two men are the same people shown in surveillance photos released last month by police. Guglielmi said the men were identified through advanced technology, interviews with Smollett and witnesses and transportation records.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired earlier Thursday that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he told the network. “Never did.”

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing.

Smollett also told ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were “ridiculous” to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

He said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

The singer and actor said the attackers also yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some media outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation."

Smollet says he is certain that the two men caught on camera were the same involved in the January 29 incident.

TMZ reports that one of the men is an actor who has appeared in Empire.

Chicago Police Department would not confirm that detail on Thursday when contacted by DailyMail.com but a spokesman said the men being interviewed were the same two filmed walking near where the attack happened at around the same time.

The men have not been charged but were picked up by police at Chicago O'Hare Airport on Wednesday night, according to the TMZ report, which claims they were found by detectives who looked at ride-sharing history records from the night of the attack to find them.

It was also reported that Smollett was being questioned over the incident again but police would not confirm that fact either.

The announcement came on Thursday hours after Smollett spoke at length about the attack in his first interview since and condemned the skepticism he has been confronted with since it became public.

He told Good Morning America that he has 'never' had 'any doubt' that the two people in the image were the ones who attacked him and that when Chicago PD released their image within the first few days of the incident, he became hopeful justice would be served.

Chicago PD have identified the two men they described as persons of interest in the Jussie Smollett case earlier this month, two weeks after the actor was attacked and within hours of his first interview about it. The two persons of interest have not been named

Wearing a collection of pins to show support of Pride and Freedom First among others, in his interview with Good Morning America that aired on Thursday, Jussie Smollett spoke in detail about the attack he suffered on January 29 and was overcome with emotion at several points

Smollett became tearful at several points during the interview as he described how he did not want to seem 'weak' when he finally agreed to report the incident to the police

Since then, there have been few developments and the police department has repeatedly spoken of the fact that Smollett did not hand over his phone when asked to do so on the night of the incident.

The two men, whose names have not been released, were filmed near to where Smollett was attacked on January 29 at 2am. They were filmed walking on the same street as the Empire star and getting up after he walked past them on the other side of the street.

To Smollett's despair, no footage of the actual attack has been uncovered yet.

In a Twitter statement on Thursday morning, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote: 'Through meticulous investigation, Chicago Police detectives have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member.

'These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned. Investigation continues.'

He posted a second tweet within a few minutes which read: 'The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported.

'They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim. '

In his hour-long interview with Good Morning America that was aired in part on Thursday, Smollett, wearing a collection of badges to show his support of Freedom and Pride among other causes, revealed his frustration at some of the public disbelief surrounding his version of events.

He said he does not think he would have been met with the same cynicism if his attackers weren't Trump supporters and revealed his belief that he was targeted because he is a vocal critic of the president.

Smollett also went into detail about why he did not immediately hand over his phone to the police to verify parts of his story and said he was trying to protect private photographs, videos, songs and phone numbers of high profile people and his partner.

He said he was frustrated that Chicago Police had not yet found surveillance footage of the incident and revealed his disappointment after learning that a camera at the very spot of the attack was turned in the opposite direction when it took place.

Choking back tears, he explained when asked why it took so long for him to contact the authorities: 'There is a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.'

Smollett also shared new photographs of his injuries which he said included a burn on his neck where the rope was placed and facial scratches

Describing the chain of events once police arrived at his apartment at the request of 60-year-old Frank Gatson, his friend who was at the apartment when the attack took place.

'I told them what happened. I asked them to turn their body cameras off. I was like, ""Please just come in.

'I don't want a big scene with my neighbors,""' he said, adding that he had left the rope around his neck and his bleach-doused clothes on for them to see.

He said that while he left the rope around his neck, it was not 'wrapped' tightly.

After the police had come into his apartment, he took them down to where the attack happened to walk them through it and became excited when he noticed a camera overlooking the exact spot where it took place.

'I told them what happened. I asked them to turn their body cameras off. I was like, ""Please just come in. I don't want a big scene with my neighbors,

'I looked up and saw there was a camera, directly on the post on the intersection.

'Then the detective told me that the camera was facing north so they didn't have it and that was disappointing.'

Later, he added how desperate he was for them to find footage of the attack.

'I want that video found so badly because, for probably four reasons.

'Number one, I want them to find the people that did it.

'Number two, I want them to stop being able to say ""alleged"" attack.

'Number three, I want them to see that I fought back,' he continued, welling-up.

'I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f*** back. They ran off,' I didn't,' he said.

He was overcome with emotion when presented with the prospect that his attackers might not be found.

'Let's just hope that they are found. Let's not go there yet. I was talking to a friend and I said,""I just hope they find them."" And she said, ""Sweetie, they're not going to find them.""

Trump condemned the attack was 'horrible' when asked about it last month. Smollett said on Thursday that he did not know how to react to the president's reaction

'That made me so angry. I'm just going to be left here with this? They get to go free and go about their life and do this to someone else and I am left with the aftermath of this bulls**t? That's not cool to me.

'I understand how difficult it will be to find them, but we gotta.

'I still want to believe there's something called justice,' he said.

Addressing why he did not hand over his phone to prove that he had been on a call with his manager when the attack took place, he said he did not feel comfortable being without the device for several hours when it contained the private information and phone numbers of celebrities and friends.

'They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to our hours. And I'm sorry but, I'm not going to do that because I have private pictures and videos and phone numbers, my partner's number, my family's numbers, my cast mates' numbers, my private emails, private songs, voice memos, pictures, videos...

'Honestly, by then, inaccurate statements had already been put out,' he said, referring to the false reports which emerged in the immediate aftermath of the attack including that the assailants were wearing MAGA hats and that his ribs were broken in it.

Smollett condemned the avalanche of false information and speculation over why he had gone out so late which ensued after it became public.

'I've heard that it was a date hone bad which I so resent that narrative. I'm not going to go out to get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous and offensive.

'Yes there's Grindr... I have not been on that in years. I can admit that I was on that back in the day when I was single,' he said.

Another falsehood was that Smollett had told police his attackers were wearing MAGA hats.

'That I had said they were wearing MAGA hats,' he said, giving an example of the misinformation that was spread.

'I never said that. I don't need to add anything like that.

'They called me a f****t. I don't need to add anything like that. I don't need to make MAGA hat the cherry on the top of some racist sundae,' he said.

'It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.

'That says a lot about the place that we are at in the country right now,' he said solemnly.

The attackers called him 'Empire f****t n****r', punched him in the face, and told him 'This is MAGA country!' before fleeing.

Smollett believes they targeted him not only because he is gay and black but because is a vocal critic of the president who he referred to only as '45'.

'I can just assume, I come really, really hard against 45. I come really, really hard against his administration and I don't hold my tongue.'

He said he was stunned when the president addressed the attack in the Oval Office and lent him his support. Trump, when asked about the incident, told reporters: 'I saw it. That's horrible. There is nothing worse as far as I am concerned.'

Smollett was shocked by his comments.

'I don't know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it,' he said, adding that he believes he was targeted because of his disdain for the president.

'I can only go off their words. Who says 'f****t', 'Empire n****r', 'This MAGA country,' ties a noose around your neck and pours bleach on you, and this is just a friendly fight?' he said.

He added he has 'no doubt' that two people in a surveillance camera image that was circulated by Chicago police are the pair who attacked him.

'I was there. For me when that was released I was like OK we're getting somewhere.

'I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. Never did.'

He also said he gave police the 'best description' he could after his friend, Frank Gatson, insisted that they call the police around 40 minutes after the attack.

One of the attackers was wearing a ski mask. Smollett, 36, described him as the 'primary aggressor'.

'I gave the description as best as I could. It's Chicago in winter. People can wear ski masks and nobody's going to question that,' he said.

Last week, police discovered a Chilli Habanero hot sauce bottle which seemed to contain bleach (above). It was found near where Smollett says he was attacked and had bleach poured on him . It was found 10 days after the attack

He said he had a large stature but could not recall any other details of either man's appearance, saying that he did not even see what color their eyes were.

The Empire actor became emotional as he recalled realizing that they had placed a noose around his neck after hitting him in the face and ribs and calling him a racial slur.

'I noticed the rope around my neck and I said, ""There's a f****** rope around my neck,""' he said.

If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.

'I'm p****d off. It's the attackers but it's also the attacks. At first it was a thing of like, listen if I tell the truth then that's it cause it's the truth.

'Then it became a thing of like, ""Oh, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that. It's the truth.""

'And then it became a thing of like, ""Oh. It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth,' he said.

He also addressed the threatening letter he received in the mail a week before the attack at the Empire studio which contained a powder police believe may have been Tylenol.

A week before the attack, Smollett received this threatening letter at the Fox studio where he works

'On the letter it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing to it. The return address said in big red caps, MAGA.

'Did I make that up too?' he said.

It was not the first attack he has received, he said, adding that he had become accustomed to them as an 'outspoken public figure'.

'I get threatened all the time on Twitter and Instagram and DMs and things like that but it's like, you know, I'm a public figure. I am very outspoken. Sometimes maybe too outspoken. But it's who I am.

'So I get the idea of p****** people off, that you're going to rub people the wrong way.'

Smollett is pictured in the hospital after a friend called the police to report him being attacked. He did not want to involve authorities

In the initial aftermath of the attack, Smollett received an outpouring of support from celebrities and fans alike who all condemned the discrimination he was subjected to.

But in the weeks since, details of the incident have been picked over forensically.

Some of his neighbors have expressed skepticism that it happened the way he said it did and the lack of evidence has done nothing to quell their cynicism.

They have also pointed out repeatedly that Smollett did not immediately turn over his phone records or his phone to prove that he was on a call with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, when the attack took place as claimed.

It carries special significance because Moore claims to have heard the attackers calling Smollett 'Empire f****t n****r' and shouting: 'This is MAGA country!'

Within the first few days of the attack, he gave an interview to Variety saying he had heard the slurs but he has not spoken about it since.

On Monday, Smollett finally did hand over his records but they were redacted.

Chicago Police Department described them as 'insufficient proof' of the call.

The actor angrily responded that via a representative that he was never told as much and that they were redacted to protect 'personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.'

The rest of Smollett's ABC interview will be shown on Nightline on Thursday.

Smollett and his manager Brandon Z. Moore are pictured. Brandon claimed to have heard Smollett's attackers calling him 'Empire f****t n***r' and shouting 'This is MAGA country!'"

During the interview with Robin Roberts, Smollett focused on responding to skeptics who say his story about a hate crime doesn’t add up:

Smollett admitted that he was hesitant to turn over his phone records to police to corroborate his claims. Earlier this week, cops confirmed they received the records but said they were “heavily redacted” and insufficient for a criminal investigation. “They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but I’m not gonna do that,” the singer said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

He also told Roberts he believes the two people shown in grainy screen captures released by the police are the ones who allegedly attacked him.

.@JussieSmollett tells @RobinRoberts that there is no doubt in his mind that the men pictured in surveillance footage attacked him. ""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them."" See more of the EXCLUSIVE interview TOMORROW on @GMA. https://t.co/3HbyU2SFxe pic.twitter.com/hiNGiHDyl0 — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 13, 2019

NRO‘s Kyle Smith took note of how Smollett’s story has changed.

Smollett, who has his fair share of defenders, too, also lashed out during the interview at those who question his story, suggesting that they’re motivated by race:

Jussie Smollett says those questioning his account are racially motivated: ""If I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more"" pic.twitter.com/n0JZ4CRJYW — Jon Levine (@LevineJonathan) February 14, 2019

Oh please. The reason there are questions and criticism is because a lot about the story doesn’t make sense. As I noted Tuesday:

So if I’m reading all of this correctly, within a 60 second time span Smollett was viciously attacked by two hooded men who knew who he was while on his way back to the hotel from grabbing a sub. They yelled something about “MAGA country!” to the well-known actor, who detests President Trump. These two random people who were walking around in the middle of the night happened to have their faces covered and were carrying a thin rope and a hot sauce bottle that contained bleach. The allegedly poured it on him and called him homophobic and racist names, and put the rope around his neck. Smollett managed to stay on his phone with his manager throughout the attack, keep his sandwich, and he still had the rope around his neck when he casually walked into the hotel. He was “hesitant” to call the police about the attack until he went to the hospital later that morning, and waited until two weeks after the alleged incident to give the Chicago PD only partial, redacted phone records.

Not only that, but a lot of people are skeptical of stories like this because of the growing number of FAKE hate crimes reported on in the news.

Chicago Police have said they will consider filing false report charges against Smollett if the story turns out to be a hoax. They are also questioning the two “persons of interest” seen in the grainy screen captures.

Stay tuned.

Now that the Democrats have a majority in the House, the anti-lynching bill that the Senate passed Thursday will likely sail through the House without any problems. The final stop will be President Trump’s desk for signature.

Booker dispelled any notion that there was no need for an anti-lynching law in the 21st century.

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching,” Booker tweeted in January.” I’m glad he’s safe. To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention.”

{snip}

The Senate’s vote in December was historic because it was the first time that senators passed an anti-lynching bill after almost 200 failed attempts over more than a century. During that time, the House passed several anti-lynching bills only to have them die in the Senate.

The Senate’s three Black senators — Harris, Booker and Republican Sen. Tim Scott — introduced the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018 in June. It calls for a life prison sentence for those found guilty on federal anti-lynching charges.

The Senate bill underscores statistics — including that more than 4,700 people were lynched between the years 1882 and 1968 — supported by research compiled by Tuskegee University, according to NPR. About 75 percent of the victims were African-Americans while “99 percent of all perpetrators of lynching escaped from punishment by state or local officials.”"

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett gave his first television interview about the alleged hate crime in which he was targeted two weeks ago in Chicago. You can see a portion of the interview aired today on ABC’s “Good Morning America” in the clip below.

TMZ, meanwhile, is reporting that Smollett was questioned again today by Chicago police, and that another man — an actor who has also appeared on “Empire” — has been questioned.

“Sources connected to the case tell us the actor, not Jussie, was picked up by Chicago PD Wednesday night right after he flew into O’Hare Airport,” TMZ reports. “We’re told Jussie was brought in Thursday morning for additional questioning. Another man who was with the actor at O’Hare was also taken in for questioning.”

TMZ adds: “The two individuals are being questioned as ‘persons of interest.’ Police won’t say if they are the same 2 people seen in the grainy image released last month. But, law enforcement sources tell TMZ, they believe the 2 people were at the scene of the alleged attack.”

TMZ notes that police said they used rideshare and/or taxi records to help find the two people being questioned.

Smollett has said he believes the two men seen in a grainy photo from surveillance footage, which was released by Chicago police, are the men who attacked him. You can see that photo by clicking here.

I am forever changed,"" Smollett said during the interview, which marked his first detailed public account of the attack. Police say Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was assaulted around 2am on January 29 by two ""unknown offenders"" who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on the actor and wrapped a rope around his neck. The Empire star wiped away tears as he described his anger over the assault, and about people not believing his story. Credit:ABC Chicago police have not made any arrests and have not found video of the alleged assault, leading some people to doubt Smollett's account of what happened. Smollett, who wiped away tears throughout the interview, told Roberts he is angry about the assault, and about people not believing his story. ""At first, it was like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth',"" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that, like how do you not believe that. It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.'"" Smollett told Roberts that before the alleged attack, he had gone to a Subway restaurant shortly after landing in Chicago, where the Fox drama is filmed.

He was on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, as he left the restaurant. As he crossed the street, Smollett said he heard someone yell Empire, which he ignored. It was after hearing homophobic and racial slurs that he turned around and confronted a man in a ski mask. Loading Smollett said the attacker told him, ""This is MAGA country"" and used a racial slur before punching him in the face. ""So I punched his a-- right back."" ""We started tussling,"" Smollett said. A second attacker began kicking him in the back. ""Then it just stopped and they ran off. "" Smollett said his manager was still on the phone, which had fallen out of his pocket. He told Moore that he had just been jumped. Then, Smollett said, he looked down and saw a rope.

""I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming,"" Smollett said. ""And I said 'There's a f---ing rope around my neck."" Police previously revealed that a thin white rope was still around Smollett's neck when they first came into contact with him, about 40 minutes after the attack. He told Roberts that he was able to give only a body description of his attackers because the entire encounter happened so fast. ""It felt like minutes, but it was probably like 30 seconds, honestly,"" Smollett said. Smollett addressed reports that he initially hesitated to go to the police about his alleged assault.""We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak. And I'm not weak,"" he said. ""We, as a people, are not weak."" Smollett explained that he kept the rope around his neck and didn't change the clothes he had worn during the attack because he smelled bleach and thought his clothes looked as if they had been doused with the liquid. ""I wanted (the police) to see what this was."" Police have not confirmed that the substance allegedly poured on Smollett during the attack was bleach. But the New York Post reported this week that its staffers found an ""empty hot sauce bottle that was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach"" near the scene of the alleged attack.

A police spokeswoman confirmed that the bottle was found by New York Post staffers and that it was turned over to the police for analysis. The spokeswoman said that the bottle had not been discovered during earlier searches of the area and that the FBI would assist with the analysis. The actor said he doesn't ""have any doubt"" that the two people in the surveillance image released by police are his alleged attackers. ""I want that video found so badly"" - for multiple reasons, Smollett told Roberts. ""No, 1, I want them to find the people that did it, No. 2, I want them to stop being able to say 'alleged attack.' ""I want them to see that I fought back,"" Smollett continued, his voice breaking. ""And I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f--- back."" ""I didn't run off. They did,"" Smollett said, referring to his attackers.

Smollett has faced increased scrutiny this week amid reports that he gave redacted phone records to police. A spokeswoman for the Chicago Police Department confirmed that they ""received limited and redacted phone records from the victim."" The spokeswoman said the records will be analysed by detectives, who will follow up with Smollett if additional information is needed. She added that Moore, who police consider a key witness because he said he could hear the attackers over the phone, ""has refused to let police examine his phone."" Smollett's publicist released a statement this week noting that ""any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,"" something Smollett reiterated in his GMA interview. The statement emphasised that Smollett is a victim and that he has cooperated with police throughout the investigation. ""Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible,"" Smollett's publicist said in the statement.

Earlier this month, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told Chicago's ABC7 that Smollett had ""been very cooperative and we have no reason, at this point, to think that he's not being genuine with us."" Smollett told Roberts that he believes some have doubted his story because he said his attackers referenced Make America Great Again, President Donald Trump's campaign slogan. ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me… a lot more,"" he said. ""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now."" ""I come really, really hard against"" Trump, Smollett said. ""I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don't hold my tongue."" Trump was asked about Smollett's attack in an interview earlier this month. ""I think that's horrible,"" he said. ""It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.""

Roberts asked Smollett whether he had seen the president's comments. ""I saw it,"" Smollett said. ""I don't know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it."" Roberts asked the actor, ""If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal?"" ""I don't know,"" Smollett said, as his eyes filled with tears."" Let's just hope that they are. Let's not go there yet."" ""I understand how difficult it will be to find them, but we got to,"" he added. ""I still want to believe with every thing that has happened that there's something called justice."" Washington Post"

Yungen on Project Purple, wanting to work with Ariana Grande and why his album will be worth the wait

Yungen has been on the scene for nearly a decade, surprising us all with songs after songs.

But, despite dropping some absolute bangers in the past, the Bestie rapper has only just released his second EP, Project Purple, nearly five years since his debut, Project Black & Red.

And, speaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk, the 27-year-old revealed he’s changed a lot in between the two releases.

‘In the last four and a half years a lot changed in my life, my career since putting out my last work. I got a record deal, everything changed in my life, the environment I was in…,’ he told us. ‘I just started experimenting, doing different things with music and trying new things. I don’t ever want to put out a body of work that is rushed and I’m just doing it for the sake of it, I’d rather put out songs here and there, and then, when I’m ready, put out the body of the work.

‘I was in a whole different place four and a half years ago. I couldn’t even imagine being there right now. The songs on my new project that I started three years ago, I knew this is going on my next body of work… But then there’s tunes, like when I did Bestie – I made it and two weeks later we went and shot the video. That just happened so quickly, but there are songs I recorded three years ago that are only coming out now. I don’t like wasting music either.

‘I’ve been waiting to put this out for a long time, it’s something I’ve been working on for a while. I’ve said I won’t wait this long again, it won’t be another four and a half years until my next release.’

Yungen, real name CJ Brooks, released his first YouTube video way back in 2010, and has been on a rise ever since. He has performed a sold-out tour across the UK, collaborated with huge names – including Stormzy and Jess Glynne – and sent the crowd wild at Wireless. But it wasn’t until releasing Bestie two years ago that he properly blew up – and was everyone’s Instagram caption for days.

Side note: It is a total bop.

And the rapper admits the success has been ‘surreal’, continuing: ‘You hope and pray, and think, if you work hard then one day it’ll happen, and when it’s around the corner… We knew it was getting bigger and bigger. That was a really good feeling, but we’ve got to go again. I didn’t even celebrate that, I was like, we’ve got to go again now.

‘Once you have that with a song, you try and get it all the time. It’s so hard because it seems you’re forcing it. That was so natural, how it came about. We didn’t think, “Everyone is going to be singing this”. We never even thought that, but it seemed so logical. I tried to do another song like that but it just didn’t work.

Project Purple features collaborations with a string of big names, including Dappy and Angel. But, ahead of his debut album, Yungen revealed he is looking even higher – and has some huge names in his sights.

‘I would like to work with Drake, I think he’s special. I wouldn’t let him rap on a tune with me though, I wouldn’t want him to outdo me rapping-wise,’ he explained. ‘And Ed Sheeran. I’ve got a tune I’ve had for like four years, someone is singing on it… But this song is meant for Ed Sheeran. I’m not putting it out until I get Ed Sheeran on it. Hopefully one day we can make it happen. I think he would. Also Ariana Grande. I’m an Ariana Grande fan, I probably am gonna go to her concert, she’s so good.’

Count us in.

However, while Yungen has finally got the recognition he definitely deserves, and footballers quoting his songs on their Instagram captions – aka Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – he is adamant the public lifestyle isn’t really for him, and his friends actually believe he’s the ‘most boring rapper’.

‘I’m a really private person,’ he laughed. ‘My friends think I’m the most boring rapper in the world. I don’t go out, I don’t like doing anything, I just want to be in my house, playing on the computer, or in the studio, or playing shows. That’s all I want to do. Nothing else really excites me. I’m proper private, no one knows anything! In one of my songs I say I’ve got a penthouse on the river, and my friends said, “People will think you’re lying! You don’t ever Snapchat anything! If we lived here, we would be Snapchatting it all the time!” No but I don’t want anyone to know where I live, and they’re like, “So why say it then?!” I do have one though. But they probably think I’m lying.

Sure, hun…

The rapper released Project Purple recently, but isn’t planning on resting on his laurels just yet – and is hard at work on his debut album.

Yes, seriously. Everything we’ve heard so far isn’t even an album yet.

But he won’t keep us waiting as long as he has an idea of how he wants it to sound, the features he wants to include, and where he wants to go from here.

And what is his dream?

‘I think I’m living the dream now,’ he added. ‘Not even being clichéd but I never thought six years ago that I’d be in this position, that was my dream, to be in this position. I’ve done so many amazing things in the last few years, everything has been amazing. But there’s so much more to do.’

Yungen’s Project Purple is out now.

A spokeswoman for the Chicago Police Department confirmed that they ""received limited and redacted phone records from the victim."" The spokeswoman said the records will be analysed by detectives, who will follow up with Smollett if additional information is needed. She added that Moore, who police consider a key witness because he said he could hear the attackers over the phone, ""has refused to let police examine his phone."" Smollett's publicist released a statement this week noting that ""any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,"" something Smollett reiterated in his GMA interview. The statement emphasised that Smollett is a victim and that he has cooperated with police throughout the investigation. ""Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible,"" Smollett's publicist said in the statement.

Earlier this month, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told Chicago's ABC7 that Smollett had ""been very cooperative and we have no reason, at this point, to think that he's not being genuine with us."" Smollett told Roberts that he believes some have doubted his story because he said his attackers referenced Make America Great Again, President Donald Trump's campaign slogan. ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me… a lot more,"" he said. ""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now."" ""I come really, really hard against"" Trump, Smollett said. ""I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don't hold my tongue."" Trump was asked about Smollett's attack in an interview earlier this month. ""I think that's horrible,"" he said. ""It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.""

Roberts asked Smollett whether he had seen the president's comments. ""I saw it,"" Smollett said. ""I don't know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it."" Roberts asked the actor, ""If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal?"" ""I don't know,"" Smollett said, as his eyes filled with tears."" Let's just hope that they are. Let's not go there yet."" ""I understand how difficult it will be to find them, but we got to,"" he added. ""I still want to believe with every thing that has happened that there's something called justice."" Washington Post"

I am forever changed,"" Smollett said during the interview, which marked his first detailed public account of the attack. Police say Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was assaulted around 2am on January 29 by two ""unknown offenders"" who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on the actor and wrapped a rope around his neck. The Empire star wiped away tears as he described his anger over the assault, and about people not believing his story. Credit:ABC Chicago police have not made any arrests and have not found video of the alleged assault, leading some people to doubt Smollett's account of what happened. Smollett, who wiped away tears throughout the interview, told Roberts he is angry about the assault, and about people not believing his story. ""At first, it was like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth',"" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that, like how do you not believe that. It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.'"" Smollett told Roberts that before the alleged attack, he had gone to a Subway restaurant shortly after landing in Chicago, where the Fox drama is filmed.

He was on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, as he left the restaurant. As he crossed the street, Smollett said he heard someone yell Empire, which he ignored. It was after hearing homophobic and racial slurs that he turned around and confronted a man in a ski mask. Loading Smollett said the attacker told him, ""This is MAGA country"" and used a racial slur before punching him in the face. ""So I punched his a-- right back."" ""We started tussling,"" Smollett said. A second attacker began kicking him in the back. ""Then it just stopped and they ran off. "" Smollett said his manager was still on the phone, which had fallen out of his pocket. He told Moore that he had just been jumped. Then, Smollett said, he looked down and saw a rope.

""I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming,"" Smollett said. ""And I said 'There's a f---ing rope around my neck."" Police previously revealed that a thin white rope was still around Smollett's neck when they first came into contact with him, about 40 minutes after the attack. He told Roberts that he was able to give only a body description of his attackers because the entire encounter happened so fast. ""It felt like minutes, but it was probably like 30 seconds, honestly,"" Smollett said. Smollett addressed reports that he initially hesitated to go to the police about his alleged assault.""We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak. And I'm not weak,"" he said. ""We, as a people, are not weak."" Smollett explained that he kept the rope around his neck and didn't change the clothes he had worn during the attack because he smelled bleach and thought his clothes looked as if they had been doused with the liquid. ""I wanted (the police) to see what this was."" Police have not confirmed that the substance allegedly poured on Smollett during the attack was bleach. But the New York Post reported this week that its staffers found an ""empty hot sauce bottle that was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach"" near the scene of the alleged attack.

A police spokeswoman confirmed that the bottle was found by New York Post staffers and that it was turned over to the police for analysis. The spokeswoman said that the bottle had not been discovered during earlier searches of the area and that the FBI would assist with the analysis. The actor said he doesn't ""have any doubt"" that the two people in the surveillance image released by police are his alleged attackers. ""I want that video found so badly"" - for multiple reasons, Smollett told Roberts. ""No, 1, I want them to find the people that did it, No. 2, I want them to stop being able to say 'alleged attack.' ""I want them to see that I fought back,"" Smollett continued, his voice breaking. ""And I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f--- back."" ""I didn't run off. They did,"" Smollett said, referring to his attackers.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives ""meticulously"" went over video footage and transportation records to track the men down, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.

""The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement late Friday.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

But police earlier this week said there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation."

Jussie Smollett and another Empire actor are being questioned by Chicago police again, according to reports.

TMZ reported that officers are talking to Jussie and a man, an actor who also appeared on the Fox show, about the attacks that left Jussie hospitalised last month.

Sources connected to the case told the publication that the actor, not Jussie, was picked up by Chicago PD on Wednesday night right after he flew into O’Hare Airport.

The website reports that Jussie was brought in on Thursday morning for additional questioning. Another man who was with the actor at O’Hare is also reported to have been taken in for questioning.

Authorities have not confirmed if the two people questioned are linked to the grainy image released last month of the attack. However, TMZ reports that law enforcement sources believe the two people were at the scene of the alleged attack.

Jussie recently has said he is ‘pissed off’ at people still not believing his account of what happened when he was attacked by two masked men.

The Empire star, 36, has given his first TV interview since the attack, which is set to air on Good Morning America on Thursday, and has vented his frustration at those doubting he is telling the truth.

According to The Independent, he says: ‘I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks.’

TMZ states the men in question ‘beat Jussie up, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him’, before screaming: ‘This is MAGA country’ and running away.

He was later taken to hospital for treatment.

The attack is now being treated as a ‘hate crime’ as the attackers allegedly hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor.

Jussie, who was reportedly ‘reluctant’ at first to report the attack, has had to face criticism on social media that details of his ordeal have been ‘fabricated’.

Sharing his frustration in his new interview, Jussie says: ‘You know, at first it was a thing of, “Listen if I tell the truth, then that’s it, because it’s the truth,” then it became a thing of, like, “Oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth.”

‘And then it became a thing of, like, “Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.”‘

At the beginning of February, Jussie said he believes ‘justice will be served’ and that he is determined to ‘lead with love’.

‘As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,’ he told Essence.

‘Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.’

Jussie has since returned to the public eye and performed his first concert since being attacked in West Hollywood earlier this month.

He made an emotional appearance and told the crowd that he wasn’t going to let his attackers win.

Arriving on-stage to much applause, Jussie stated: ‘I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the motherfuckers win.’

He ended his show by telling the audience: ‘We are proud. We are gay.’

Metro.co.uk have contacted reps for Jussie for a comment.

“I come really, really hard against 45. I come really hard against his administration. I don’t hold my tongue,” Jussie Smollett told interviewer Robin Roberts.

Asked what he thought about President Donald Trump calling his alleged assault “horrible,” the 36-year-old replied, “I don’t know what to say to that, you know? I appreciate him not brushing over it.”

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him and put a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck. Smollett also told detectives that before they ran off, the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country,” a reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan President Donald Trump uses."

CPD public information officer Sally Bown added to TheBlaze that the two individuals have not been charged, but she said she wasn't sure when they were taken in or if they've been released.

CPD Director of Communications Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement, ""After a meticulous investigation with the use of advance technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records, detectives have identified two persons of interest in the Empire cast member case.""

Bown also told TheBlaze there's no confirmation the two individuals in for police questioning are Chicago residents, or if they're the same individuals seen in a recently released surveillance photo taken minutes before the alleged attack.

Smollett told ABC News' Robin Roberts that he believes the two figures seen in the surveillance image are his attackers.

When Roberts pressed for more information, asking how he's sure they're the same people — given the photo is dark, grainy, taken from a distance, and contains no identifying facial features — Smollett replied, ""'Cuz I, I was there.""

He added, ""I mean, for me, when [the photo] was released, I was like, 'OK, we're getting somewhere,' you know what I'm sayin'? So, yeah, I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. Never did.""

&lt;br&gt;

'Pissed off'

Smollett also told Roberts he's ""pissed off"" at assertions his claims are a hoax:

It's like, you know at first it was a thing of like, ""Listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it, 'cuz it's the truth."" Then it became a thing of like, ""Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It's the truth."" And then it became a thing of like, ""Ohhh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

""I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,"" he added to Roberts, according to ABC News. ""And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""



He also disputed a claim that he said his alleged attackers ""were wearing MAGA hats"" — the iconic red caps with President Donald Trump's 2016 ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan: ""I never said that.""

""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett added, ABC New said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f***ot, they called me a [N-word]. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

While at least one outlet, Forbes, reported the alleged attackers wore MAGA hats, numerous outlets ran with a TMZ report saying the Smollett was beaten up by two white men wearing ski masks who asked, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before pouring bleach on him, putting a noose around his neck, and yelling, ""This is MAGA country!""— a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Chicago police told TheBlaze there was ""no mention of MAGA"" in initial reports, but when detectives followed up with Smollett later on the day of the attack, he recalled the attackers making those comments, and detectives completed a supplemental report.

Police didn't specify the race of the alleged suspects but did call it a ""possible racially charged assault and battery"" and that they are ""treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Smollet, who's openly gay, also said he was angered by claims the incident was ""a date gone bad, which I so resent ... I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive. Yes, there's Grinder, yes, there's Jack'd, yes there's all of these things, which I have not been on in years. I can admit that I was on it back in the day. I was single. You know what I'm sayin'? But I haven't been on that in years.""

Anything else?

Smollett said he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Moore, during the alleged incident. But Chicago police said the ""limited and heavily redacted"" phone records Smollett turned over detectives ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation"" as cops continue looking into Smollett's claims, WBBM-TV reported.

Guglielmi told the New York Post that ""we offered to take the phone to download the data, and he expressed he couldn't be without his phone for several hours.""

Other curious details:

Police told ABC News Smollett was seen on camera walking into an apartment with a rope around his neck and ""wearing it like a necktie"" before calling cops from inside the building. CBS News said ""when police got to his apartment, they said a noose was still around Smollett's neck.""

Rob Elgas of WLS-TV in Chicago reported that ""when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed.""

According to another tweet from Elgas, ""Smollett requested responding Chicago police officers turn off their body cameras as they arrived to take his report. A spokesman says this is not uncommon when officers enter a private residence.""

Elgas added that Chicago police have a security image of Smollett alone inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime, and that cops also obtained additional video placing him at the scene of the crime.

But sources told CBS News they've seen security video of Smollett outdoors early Tuesday morning and ""nothing of an assault.""

The weather in Chicago at midnight Jan. 29 — two hours before the alleged attack — showed a low temperature of 1 degree with 14-mph winds.

Smollett's neighbor doesn't believe the story

A neighbor of Smollett cast doubt on his story.

""I don't believe it happened the way he said it did,"" Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same apartment complex as the actor, told the New York Post. ""I've been in this neighborhood five years. I don't believe it, not around here. … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.""

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that if police suspect Smollett's story is a hoax, he will be held accountable.

Threatening letter, empty hot sauce bottle



A threatening letter and drawing to Smollett was sent to the Fox television studio in Chicago on Jan. 22, police told ABC News, and it contained a powdery substance that investigators believe was likely crushed-up Tylenol.

Smollett sat down with “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts and addressed questions being raised about the Chicago. incident, saying he is “pissed off” at being attacked.

“At first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, 'cause it's the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It's the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh. It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth; you don't even want to see the truth,'” Smollett said.

Smollett reported he was attacked and beaten at a Chicago underpass last month. Police released grainy surveillance video images of two ""persons of interest,"" whom they have since brought in for questioning.

""These individuals are not yet suspects but were in [the] area of concern and are being questioned,"" Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Thursday in a tweet. ""Investigation continues.""

Smollett gave his first TV interview as police are analyzing an empty bottle of hot sauce found near the scene of the assault.

The bottle was found just this week by a newspaper reporter and is said to smell of bleach. Smollett told police the attackers splashed him with a liquid that may have been bleach.

He says he had just left a Subway sandwich shop when he was confronted by two men.

“I kept walking and then I heard ‘f*** 'Empire' n*****,’ I see the attacker, masked, and he said, 'This is MAGA country n***** ' punches me right in the face,” he said.



He said he struggled with the attackers in the dark underpass.

“There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back. And then it just stopped and they ran off,” he said. “And then I look down and I see there's a rope around my neck.”

A newly released photo shows a rope burn on Smollett's neck, and a cut and a bruise on his cheek.

He said he hoped the attack had been caught on a surveillance camera nearby.



“The detective told me the camera inside of the casing was facing north. So they didn’t have it. So that was disappointing,” he said.

The 36-year-old actor said he wanted to correct published reports that the two men wore “Make America Great Again” hats.

“I never said that. I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I didn’t need a MAGA hat to add to some racist sundae.”

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area at the time Smollett said he was attacked, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck at about 2 a.m. Jan. 29.

Guglielmi told the Associated Press that the two men are the same people shown in surveillance photos released last month by police. Guglielmi said the men were identified through advanced technology, interviews with Smollett and witnesses, and transportation records.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired today that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he told the network. “Never did.”

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing.

Smollett also told the ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were “ridiculous” to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

He said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

The singer and actor said the attackers also yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some media outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation."

Speaking with Robin Roberts in an interview that aired Thursday morning via Good Morning America, the Empire star and Sum of My Music artist expressed hurt in light of the online accusations from some that he’s exaggerating the details of the attack, which is now being investigated as a suspected hate crime.

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth,” Smollett said in a message to his detractors, pointing out that many of them would sadly have more likely believed his story if the perpetrators had been “Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black.”

Smollett pointed out that the attackers’ shouting “This is MAGA country,” has been a specific point of contention for his detractors. “I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said to anyone questioning that aspect of the account. “They called me a f*****, they called me a n*****. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Ultimately, Smollett is “pissed off” about both the attack itself and the way some have continued to doubt his truth.

Well, on Good Morning America today the “Empire” star says he’s certain they are the guilty ones.

He claims those men in the photo screamed homophobic and racist epithets at him, tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him and beat him. He appears to be frustrated that a growing number of people just don’t believe his story.

As of now, the two men in the photo are only considered “persons of interest” and not suspects by the Chicago PD which says the video shows the 2 men on the other side of the street from Smollett, but there is a 60-second gap in the video.

In fact, Chicago Police say they have identified those two “persons of interests.”

“Through meticulous investigation, #ChicahoPolice [sic] detectives have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member. These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned. Investigation continues,” said Anthony Guglielmi, the chief spokesperson for the Chicago PD, on Twitter.

Guglielmi added this …

“Important for media reporting: The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported. They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.”

﻿

In the “Good Morning America” interview, Smollett addressed why he was initially reluctant to hand over the records, saying he did not want his private information in the hands of the police.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that,” he said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

He also tells Robin Roberts about his injuries and why he kept the rope around his neck until police arrived."

We’re back and we’re reading – everything from “The New York Times” to the “Wall Street Journal.” We’re trying to help you keep up with the rapid pace of politics and everyday news. Today, we’ve got Amazon backing out, a Japan Olympic official making apologies, and El Chapo’s new home.



Amazon decides not to build headquarters in New York



Amazon pulled out of its plan to build a second headquarters in New York City after the nearly year long search to find a location, according to The Associated Press.



The change of heart comes after a lot of pushback from local officials concerned with the tax incentives talked about.



The decision is being seen as a huge blow to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio both of whom played big roles in getting Amazon to choose New York, according to The New York Times.



Amazon claimed that the new headquarters would have created 25,000 new jobs for local residents.



McCabe tells all about time as acting FBI director



Former FBI acting director Andrew McCabe said as soon as he took the position he started investigations into the president and his ties with Russia, according to CBS News.



McCabe had his first TV interview since being fired in March 2018 with Scott Pelley. He said that the bureau began both obstruction of justice and counterintelligence investigations to make sure they would be much more difficult to be cut off without scrutiny.



He also said that there were points when there was serious conversation about enacting the 25th Amendment and removing the president from office.



Also in the interview, McCabe said that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had offered to wear a wire while having a conversation with President Trump.

Airbus no longer building A380s



Airbus announced that they will stop delivering new A380 superjets in 2021 after Emirates, the biggest buyer, decided to cut down the number of A380s ordered, according to CNN.



Airbus is a European based company and the decision is expected to effect 3,500 jobs over four major European countries. The company said that they will begin discussions with these employee representatives in the near future.



The planes are able to carry 853 passengers and cost $25 billion to develop. Airbus has built 234 planes to this point after originally saying they would build more than 1,200.

Japan Olympic official apologizes for comments



The Olympic Minister for Japan took back comments made about the possibility of the summer games being less exciting after one of the countries start swimmers made public her fight with leukemia, according to Fox News.



“When one person leads, she can boost the whole team. I am slightly worried that this type of excitement could wane,” said minister Yoshitaka Sakurada. He wished the swimmer well wishes but was heavily criticized for his lack of concern for her health.



She won six gold medals in the Asian Games in 2018 was considered a potential Gold Medalist in the upcoming Olympics.

Nobody has ever escaped El Chapo’s new home



After being found guilty, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán will be sent to the Administrative Maximum Facility about two hours outside Denver, according to The Washington Post.



Inmates stay in their cell, which is best described as the size of a small bathroom for 23 hours a day. A former federal prosecutor described it as the home of “the most dangerous and notorious criminals in the world.”



The facility boasts the highest guard-to-prisoner ratio ensuring each inmate gets personalized attention.



Deborah Golden, staff attorney at the Human Rights Defense Center, expects all of El Chapo’s communication to be more closely monitored than even the average inmate in this facility.



Two people being questioned in attack on ‘Empire’ star



Two “persons of interest” are being questioned by Chicago detectives about the attack of Jussie Smollett, according to NBC News.



The individuals are not suspects, but are being questioned because they were in the area at the alleged time of the attack.



In a report filed with the Chicago Police Department Jan. 29, the actor says that after having homophobic slurs shouted at him two people poured a chemical substance on his head and neck.



Police say that they have found no surveillance video of the attack. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said at this time he sees no reason to believe that the attack was fabricated.

That’s all we have for today. Check back tomorrow for more."

The Chicago Police Department is getting closer — kind of — to making an arrest in the Jussie Smollett attack case.

The Empire star, as you’ll remember, was apparently attacked last month on a Chicago street in the middle of the night, allegedly by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him, put a rope around his neck, and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

Now, Chicago police confirm that they’ve tracked down people who at the very least may have been witnesses on the night in question.

Related: Jussie Gives First Televised Interview Since Attack

Thursday morning, a communications officer for the Chicago PD offered up new information about how detectives have tracked down a couple “persons of interest” who may be related to the case (below):

Important for media reporting: The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported. They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim. pic.twitter.com/JuH1kYRTYV — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 14, 2019

But as those tweets are quick to note, “persons of interest” does NOT mean suspects… and the people in question here may be witnesses considering they were in the area at the time of the attack, or they may not be involved at all.

Regardless, a police department spokesperson told E! News on Thursday “charges are pending” in the case, and the two persons of interest are currently being questioned.

Whether suspects or not, this is at least something of a development considering there had been no movement on this front for several weeks, after detectives struggled to find security camera footage or other witnesses that could help their case.

In the meantime, Smollett has attempted to get back to his life as best he can, though things are clearly very difficult for him after the apparently racially-motivated violent attack.

Ugh.

So, so scary — and the uncertain aftermath with a difficult investigation still going certainly can’t help matters.

3:30 PM PT -- Police raided the home of the 2 men who cops picked up at the O'Hare Airport Wednesday night ... this according to WBBM TV reporter Charlie De Mar, who says he spoke to the family of the 2 men. Both men are Nigerian and were extras on ""Empire."" Based on what the cops have already said, it appears these are the same men who were captured on the surveillance video.

Police took bleach, shoes electronics and more.Officers asked family if they knew #Jussiesmollett. @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/PDSFtf5jwb @CharlieDeMar

According to the report, police seized 5 bottles of bleach, a red hat, 2 laptops and other items.

The family said the 2 men left for Nigeria the day of the alleged attack. This is consistent with what law enforcement sources previously told TMZ ... that the men left for Nigeria and returned Wednesday night, and the police tracked their travels and were waiting for them when they landed in Chicago.

By the way ... when we broke the story about the various details of the alleged attack, our Jussie sources said the actor identified the 2 men as white. We do not know the skin color of the 2 men from Nigeria.

Important to note ... the red hat may be a red herring, because Jussie never said the men were wearing MAGA hats ... rather, he says they screamed ""MAGA country.""

2:50 PM PT -- Chicago PD has confirmed ... the 2 men taken in for questioning are the same men in the surveillance video screen grab. The PD confirms transportation records, along with interviews with Jussie and other witnesses, led to the ID of the 2 men.

Jussie Smollett is being questioned again by Chicago PD ... and officers are also talking to another man, an actor who has also appeared on ""Empire"" ... TMZ has learned.

Sources connected to the case tell us the actor, not Jussie, was picked up by Chicago PD Wednesday night right after he flew into O'Hare Airport. We're told Jussie was brought in Thursday morning for additional questioning. Another man who was with the actor at O'Hare was also taken in for questioning.

The two individuals are being questioned as ""persons of interest."" Police won't say if they are the same 2 people seen in the grainy image released last month. But, law enforcement sources tell TMZ, they believe the 2 people were at the scene of the alleged attack.

As for how cops ID'd the 2 people they're questioning -- we're told they used rideshare and/or taxicab records to track their locations the night of the alleged incident.

Jussie is on record saying he believes the 2 men in the grainy image are the ones who attacked him.

Please, spare us the fabricated tales of when you smoked weed in college, while listening to rappers who didn’t even record an album yet. Defenders, I’m sure she was replying to another interviewer who was not asking about her taste in music.

Nobody cares about youthful indiscretions involving weed use, and haven’t cared since Bill Clinton claimed he “didn’t inhale,” and then-candidate Barack Obama admitted he was a member of the “choom gang.”

It is more troubling for a candidate to demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of basic economics, or a propensity to obfuscate and prevaricate in the pursuit of political gain.

Claiming tax cuts and refunds are lower than in the previous years, is one such example. Ryan Ellis at the Washington Examiner explained without misdirection:

People may have gotten their tax cut in their weekly paychecks, and not as much from their usual tax refund. People who e-file this early (which means they have nothing more than wage income and simple financial and family setups) have received the bulk of their tax cut already in the form of higher take-home pay throughout the course of last year.

Kamala Harris’ blatant appeal to identity politics, specifically lighting a fire under black’s sensitivities, has no place in the Office of President of the United States.

Clearly, Team Harris has determined being a person of color will alone earn her the black vote in Southern primaries, and that she can pivot to whatever passes for a center among the radical progressive left.

For the record, she is not an African American with roots in the nation’s slavery history, but rather a woman of mixed East Indian and Jamaican heritage.

Her plan may very well succeed, as some polls suggest she is now in second place behind former Vice President Joe Biden. She is clearly the favorite among progressives in the media blogosphere and Twittersphere, and more importantly among leftwing opinion purveyors in Big Media.

If the exploitation of sectionalism, balkanization and racial animus were not enough to cause them to reconsider Senator Harris for the presidency, consider her repeated rush to judgements for blatant racial appeal.

When the alleged “attack” on Jussie Smollet was initially reported, she tweeted the following:



.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery.



This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

It was initially claimed and reported the “Empire” actor was attacked by people wearing MAGA hats who taunted him with racist and homophobic slurs, before putting a “lynching rope” around his neck and dousing him with a chemical agent “which may have been bleach.”

UPDATE: Jussie Smollet appears to have staged the attack. The Chicago Police Department has pushed back on elements of the report, though they raided the home of two actors of two Nigerian descent. At least one appeared on the show “Empire” as a stand-in.

BREAKING: Multiple soucres tell @ABC7Chicago Eyewitness News Jussie Smollet and the 2 men who are being questioned by police staged the attack – allegedly because his character was being written out of the show Empire. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) February 15, 2019

Lynching is a dark and despicable part of our nation’s history, yet it is still not a federal hate crime. Passing a federal anti-lynching law must be a priority for this new Congress.

Surveillance cameras have shown no such attack.

But they did show Mr. Smollett eating a Subway sandwich subsequent to this alleged hate crime. He still refuses to turn over his cell phone to the police, after claiming he was using it during the attack.

Now, it may be that Mr. Smollet made the whole thing up, or it may turn out that his statements about what allegedly happened to him were correct.

But that is not the point.

The point is that a leading candidate for President of the United States used a totally unverified and racially-charged story for blatant political purposes, without first waiting for police confirmation.

That such a person could take this sort of rush-to-judgement attitude to the office of the presidency, is frightening. That such a person could use race to divide the nation when there has been a period of slow and steady healing, is morally criminal.

Kamala Harris must not win the presidency for the betterment of all races."

This morning, he sat with Robin Roberts to discuss the attack, his doubters, and a message to the LGBTQ community.

Check out the highlights from the interview and the full video below.

I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers but it’s also the attacks. At first, it was a thing of, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth, that’s it because it’s the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘How can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth!’ And then it became a thing of, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this the truth, you don’t even want to see that this is the truth.’ While he was on the phone, I heard, as I was crossing the intersection, I heard, ‘Empire.’ I don’t answer to ‘Empire.’ My name ain’t ‘Empire.’ I didn’t answer. I kept walking. Then I heard, ‘F*gg*t Empire N*gg*r.’ So I turned around and I said, ‘The f*ck did you just say to me?’ Then I see the attacker, masked. And he said, ‘This MAGA country n*gger.’ Punches me right in the face. So I punched his ass back. And we started tussling. It was very icy and we ended up tussling by the stairs. Fighting, fighting, fighting. There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back, then it just stopped and they ran off. …Then I look down and I see that there’s a rope around my neck. It was so fast. It felt like minutes but it probably was like thirty seconds. I can’t tell you honestly. I can’t tell you honestly. I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming. I said, ‘There’s a f*cking rope around my neck.’ I gave a body description but I can’t tell you what color their eyes were. It’s Chicago in winter. People can wear ski masks and nobody’s going to question that.

Robin Roberts asked him about the picture Chicago Police released of potential suspects and asked Smollett if he thought these could be the men who attacked him. He said:

I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did. I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community, young Black children to know how strong that they are. To know the power that they hold in their little pinky. I get threatened all the time on Twitter and Instagram and DMs but I’m a public figure, I’m very outspoken, sometimes maybe too outspoken but it’s who I am so I get idea of pissing people off, that you’re going to rub people the wrong way.

When Roberts asked him if believes the letter that was sent to Fox studios was connected to his attack, he said yes because of the rope around the stick figure’s neck.

“Just because on the letter on the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree, with a gun pointing toward it. There was no address but the return address said in big, red letters MAGA. Did I make that up too?” I want that video found so badly for four reasons. I want them to find the people that did it. I want them to stop being able to say alleged attack. I want them to see that I fought back and I want a little gay boy, who might watch this to see that I fought the f*ck back. And that does not take anything away from people that are not able to do that. But I fought back. They ran off, I didn’t.

When asked what he would say to a young, gay man, Jussie said:

To learn to fight and I don’t just mean [physically.] Learn to fight. Learn to be a fighter. I am not advocating violence at all. If you’re going to die, fight until you do. Because if you don’t fight, you have no chance. I’m an advocate. I respect, too much, the people who have been attacked in any way. You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.

Roberts asked Smollett, how he would be able to heal if the attackers were never found. With tears in his eyes, Smollett said:

“ I don’t know. Let’s just hope that they are. Let’s not go there yet. I was talking to a friend and I said, ‘I just want them to find them.’ And she said, ‘Sweetie, they’re not going to find them.’ And it just made me so angry. Because I’m just going to be left here with this? I’m just going to be left here with like, ‘So they get to go free and go about their life and they get to attack someone else?’ And I’m here left with the aftermath of this bull? That’s not cool to me. That’s not ok. I understand how difficult it will be to find them but we gotta. I still want to believe, with everything that’s happened, that there’s still something called justice.

Cory Booker has pointed to the racist and homophobic attack on actor Jussie Smollet to show the necessity for Congress to finally pass an anti-lynching law, which cleared a key hurdle Thursday as it winds its way through the legislative process.

The U.S. Senate passed an anti-lynching bill on Thursday, which was announced Sen. Kamala Harris, one of the three senators who introduced the measure in 2018.

BREAKING: Our anti-lynching bill, which would make lynching a federal crime, just unanimously passed the Senate. Lynching is a dark, despicable part of our nation's history and I'm hopeful this measure will swiftly pass the House. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 14, 2019

“Our anti-lynching bill, which would make lynching a federal crime, just unanimously passed the Senate. Lynching is a dark, despicable part of our nation’s history and I’m hopeful this measure will swiftly pass the House,” Harris tweeted.

In December, the Senate made history by passing the same bill. However, it had to be re-introduced in the Senate this year because the Republican-controlled House of Representative failed to bring it up for a vote before the year ended.

Now that the Democrats have a majority in the House, the anti-lynching bill that the Senate passed Thursday will likely sail through the House without any problems. The final stop will be President Trump’s desk for signature.

Booker dispelled any notion that there was no need for an anti-lynching law in the 21st century.

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching,” Booker tweeted in January.” I’m glad he’s safe. To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention.”

On Feb. 9, while walking to a Subway, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at Smollett after he exited the restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Sen. Kamala Harris celebrates the Senate's historic passage of an anti-lynching bill after nearly 200 failed attempts…https://t.co/igpiN4tAFi pic.twitter.com/lVxWionc0n — NewsOne (@newsone) December 19, 2018

The Senate’s vote in December was historic because it was the first time that senators passed an anti-lynching bill after almost 200 failed attempts over more than a century. During that time, the House passed several anti-lynching bills only to have them die in the Senate.

The Senate’s three Black senators—Harris, Booker and Republican Sen. Tim Scott—introduced the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018 in June. It calls for a life prison sentence for those found guilty on federal anti-lynching charges.

The Senate bill underscores statistics — including that more than 4,700 people were lynched between the years 1882 and 1968 — supported by research compiled by Tuskegee University, according to NPR. About 75 percent of the victims were African-Americans while “99 percent of all perpetrators of lynching escaped from punishment by state or local officials.”

On Monday, January 28, two unidentified men attacked Empire actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago, yelling racist and homophobic slurs at him, pouring an unidentified chemical substance on his body, and putting his head in a noose. After the attack, the actor got himself to a hospital, where he was declared “in good condition.” On January 29, the Chicago Police Department released a security-camera image of two “potential persons of interest” who were seen in the area of the attack, which they were investigating as a hate crime.

Now, police say they have identified two persons of interest using “advance technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records,” per an email obtained by CBS News. Authorities did not say whether those persons of interest were the same people seen on the security camera footage, nor did they release their names. On Friday, February 15, the AP reported that CPD had taken two men into custody; they are officially being considered as suspects, an update from chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi’s update on Thursday.

Police have identified the men only as two Nigerian brothers. Police have been questioning them since they were picked up by officers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their home.

According to the AP, one of the men had reportedly worked on Empire at one point in time, but it’s unclear in what capacity or how long ago.

The CPD also issued a statement against the reports that the attack against Smollett was an alleged “hoax,” and said it contacted a local ABC affiliate to correct their reporting, which was based on “uninformed and inaccurate” sources.

On Thursday, February 14, Smollett appeared on Good Morning America. Speaking with Robin Roberts, he said, “I understand how difficult it will be to find them, but we gotta. I still want to believe, with everything that has happened, that there’s something called justice.”

“I will never be the man that this did not happen to,” he said, and added that he hopes his story inspires members of marginalized groups to “learn to be a fighter.”

“I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ+ community, young black children to know how strong they are,” he added. “To know the power that they hold in their little pinkie.”

Chicago police are questioning two “people of interest” in the alleged racist and homophobic attack against “Empire” star Jussie Smollett.

“Through s meticulous investigation, #ChicahoPolice (sic) detectives have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member. These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned. Investigation continues,” tweeted CPD Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi, adding in a second tweet, “We remain in communication with the alleged victim.”

Smollett says he was on the phone with his manager Brandon Z. Moore and walking home from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. Jan. 29 when he was accosted by two people who shouted racial slurs, tied a noose around his neck and doused him in a “chemical substance” resembling bleach.

The investigation has been stymied by a lack of security-camera footage — and Smollett’s refusal to furnish police with phone records. He handed over heavily redacted call logs 13 days after the attack on Tuesday, arguing the redactions were to protect “high-profile individuals.”

Neighbors have cast doubt on his account, but a Post reporter at the scene also found a hot sauce bottle smelling of bleach that police took into evidence."

The actor-singer was more candid than he’s been before, and the public now knows all the graphic details of the Jussie Smollett attack from his own perspective.

Good Morning America‘s Robin Roberts, who conducted the sit-down, has said the Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett’s story to be consistent — in other words, it hasn’t changed since the incident — and credible, and that he’s been cooperative during the investigation.

Smollett believes, at least in part, that the attack against him was due to his open criticism of Donald Trump (which also helps explain what Smollett claims was said to him during the attack, “This is MAGA country”). “I come really, really hard against 45,” he told Roberts. “I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

According to the openly gay actor-singer, 36, he claims that after he arrived via plane to Chicago, he was taken to his apartment but needed food. He says he tried a Walgreens, which was closed, so instead walked across the street to a Subway sandwich shop. While in the intersection, he says he heard someone say “Empire,” but kept walking.

“I don’t answer to ‘Empire.’ My name ain’t ‘Empire,’ and I didn’t answer,” he says.

From Page Six:

“I kept walking, and then I heard ‘f—-t, Empire n—r.’ So, I turned around and I said, ‘The f–k did you just say to me?'”

One of the masked men shouted, “This is MAGA country, n—-r!” before punching him in the face.

“So I punched his ass back,” Smollett said. “And then we started tussling and it was very icy. We ended up tussling by the stairs, fighting, fighting, fighting. There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back, and then it just stopped. And they ran off.”

Smollett grabbed his phone and told [his manager Brandon Moore] Moore that he’d just been “jumped” — and that’s when he said he noticed the rope around his neck.

“I started screaming. I said, ‘There’s a f—ing rope around my neck!”

In the snippet of the interview about the Jussie Smollett attack we’ve seen, he doesn’t mention the chemical substance — thought to be bleach — that was dumped on him when discussing how the events of Jan. 29 unfolded. He does, however, maintain bleach was poured on him.

“I can only go off their words,” Smollett says regarding the motive of his attackers, who hurled both racist and homophobic slurs at him before and during the attack.

There have been headlines in the weeks past that made Smollett seem uncooperative with the Chicago Police Department, which had asked for Smollett’s phone so they could corroborate his claims. Smollett refused to hand over his phone, instead opting for phone records, which the police said were too redacted to be sufficient for the investigation.

Now the actor-singer says, “They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but I’m not gonna do that. Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmates’ number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

He also believes the one image that has been released of the persons of interest in the Jussie Smollett attack (above) are indeed his attackers. “I was there. For me, when that was released, I was like OK, we’re getting somewhere,” he says. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

Smollett knows his attackers may never be brought to justice, and seems to have come to terms with that, even though it continues to infuriate him. “I just want them to find them,” Smollett says he told a friend. “And she said, ‘Sweetie, they’re not going to find them.’ And that just made me so angry. Because I’m just going to be left here with this? I’m going to be left there with — so they get to go free and go about their lives and possibly attack somebody else? And I’m here left with the aftermath of this bull? That’s not OK to me.”

And to the people who still refuse to believe this Jussie Smollett attack ever took place, which reportedly includes some of the actor-singer’s own neighbors, he says he’s “pissed off.”

“You don’t even want to see the truth,” he says.

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck while he was walking outside around 2 a.m. on January 29.

Smollett, who is black, Jewish and gay, told ABC News that he left the rope and clothes on when police arrived “because I wanted them to see.” He said he’s heard various stories about people questioning the attack, which he said occurred while he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

The singer and actor said the attackers also yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some media outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

No arrests have been made. Police said they’ve not found surveillance video that shows the attack but that the investigation is ongoing.

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf.

Smollett said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone for their investigation because the device contains private content and phone numbers. Smollett gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation.

Smollett made the assertion in an interview with ABC News' Robin Roberts, who asked the actor and singer if the two individuals in the image — who police said shows them between 1:30 to 1:45 a.m. in the vicinity of the alleged 2 a.m. Jan. 29 incident — are his attackers.

""I do,"" the 36-year-old actor replied.

""What is it about their size or ... why do you feel that they could possibly be?"" Roberts asked, pressing for more information.

Smollet smiled, shifted in his seat, and said, ""'Cuz I, I was there.""

""I mean, for me, when [the photo] was released, I was like, 'OK, we're getting somewhere,' you know what I'm sayin'?"" he added to Roberts. ""So, yeah, I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. Never did.""

What else did Smollett say?

Smollett also told Roberts he's ""pissed off"" at assertions his claims are a hoax:

It's like, you know at first it was a thing of like, ""Listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it, 'cuz it's the truth."" Then it became a thing of like, ""Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It's the truth."" And then it became a thing of like, ""Ohhh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

""I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,"" he added to Roberts, according to ABC News. ""And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""



He also disputed a claim that he said his alleged attackers ""were wearing MAGA hats"" — the iconic red caps with President Donald Trump's 2016 ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan: ""I never said that.""

""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett added, ABC New said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f***ot, they called me a [N-word]. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

While at least one outlet — Forbes — reported the alleged attackers wore MAGA hats — numerous outlets ran with a TMZ report saying the Smollett was beaten up by two white men wearing ski masks who asked, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before pouring bleach on him, putting a noose around his neck, and yelling, ""This is MAGA country!""— a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Chicago police told TheBlaze there was ""no mention of MAGA"" in initial reports, but when detectives followed up with Smollett later on the day of the attack, he recalled the attackers making those comments, and detectives completed a supplemental report.

Police didn't specify the race of the alleged suspects but did call it a ""possible racially charged assault and battery"" and that they are ""treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Smollet, who's openly gay, also said he was angered by claims the incident was ""a date gone bad, which I so resent ... I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive. Yes, there's Grinder, yes, there's Jack'd, yes there's all of these things, which I have not been on in years. I can admit that I was on it back in the day. I was single. You know what I'm sayin'? But I haven't been on that in years.""

More details about alleged attack

Smollet said he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Moore, after leaving a leaving a Subway restaurant.

""While he was on the phone I heard, as I was crossing the intersection I heard, 'Empire!,' Smollett told Roberts. ""I don't answer to 'Empire.' My name ain't 'Empire.'""

Smollett said he kept walking without a response and then heard an apparent racial slur.

""So I turned around and I said, 'What the [blank] did you just say to me?' and I see the attacker masked,"" Smollett continued. ""And he said, 'This is MAGA country [blank],' and he punches me in the face, so I punched his ass back."" He added that the fight continued near some stairs when a second person joined in and began kicking him in the back.

""Then it just stopped, and they ran off, and I saw where they ran,"" Smollet added.

He also told Roberts that Moore was still on the phone when he picked it, telling his manager he was ""jumped.""



""Then I looked down and I see that there's a rope around my neck ... and I started screaming, and I said, 'There's a [blank] rope around my neck,"" Smollett added to Roberts.

&lt;br&gt;

Anything else?

Chicago police said the ""limited and heavily redacted"" phone records Smollett turned over detectives ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation"" as cops continue looking into Smollett's claims, WBBM-TV reported.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the New York Post that ""we offered to take the phone to download the data, and he expressed he couldn't be without his phone for several hours.""

Other curious details:

Police told ABC News Smollett was seen on camera walking into an apartment with a rope around his neck and ""wearing it like a necktie"" before calling cops from inside the building. CBS News said ""when police got to his apartment, they said a noose was still around Smollett's neck.""

Rob Elgas of WLS-TV in Chicago reported that ""when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed.""

According to another tweet from Elgas, ""Smollett requested responding Chicago police officers turn off their body cameras as they arrived to take his report. A spokesman says this is not uncommon when officers enter a private residence.""

Elgas added that Chicago police have a security image of Smollett alone inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime, and that cops also obtained additional video placing him at the scene of the crime.

But sources told CBS News they've seen security video of Smollett outdoors early Tuesday morning and ""nothing of an assault.""

The weather in Chicago at midnight Jan. 29 — two hours before the alleged attack — showed a low temperature of 1 degree with 14-mph winds.

Guglielmi told The Associated Press that detectives have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area and are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the individuals who match Smollett's description..

The AP added that Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses, and in train tunnels — and that police said such cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests.

Smollett's neighbor doesn't believe the story

A neighbor of Smollett cast doubt on his story.

""I don't believe it happened the way he said it did,"" Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same apartment complex as the actor, told the Post. ""I've been in this neighborhood five years. I don't believe it, not around here. … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.""

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that if police suspect Smollett's story is a hoax, he will be held accountable.

Threatening letter, empty hot sauce bottle



A threatening letter and drawing to Smollett was sent to the Fox television studio in Chicago on Jan. 22, police told ABC News, and it contained a powdery substance that investigators believe was likely crushed-up Tylenol.

The Post said last week it traced Smollett's likely route to the underpass from a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop where he bought a tuna sandwich and a salad, and that near the foot of a stairwell to the Loews, the paper found an empty hot sauce bottle that was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach.

Guglielmi told the Post that after police seized the bottle it was turned over to the FBI for analysis; the FBI declined to comment.

Chicago police said if they discover Smollett made a false police report, he would face consequences."

For the first time since news broke of the attack, Smollett sat down with ABC’s Robin Roberts on Good Morning America this week to speak out on what happened, and the response he’s received since the incident.

“It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, 'cause it's the truth,’"" he said, referencing the small but vocal population that has claimed his account is fabricated. “Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you -- how do you not believe that? It's the truth.’ And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.'""

The actor offered his account of what happened that Tuesday evening in Chicago. He said that after going to a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. he was approached by two masked figures, who he says called him “f----t Empire n----r,” and began beating him before tying a rope around his neck, pouring a substance believed to be bleach on him, and fleeing the scene. Photos have since been released of two potential suspects, who Smollett identified as his attackers on GMA.

Since the attack, some have taken to questioning Smollett’s story, pointing to the fact that he initially refused to give his phone to police and that the redacted records he did give were later called “insufficient” by the Chicago Police Department.

During the interview, Smollett addressed those concerns, saying he resented the idea that he would fabricate a crime to make a political point. “For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" he said, referring to reports that the assailants made a reference to Pres. Trump's signature ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f----t, they called me a n----r. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

The actor also pointed out that, based on the responses he’s seen to his attack, the race of the attackers matters. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,” he said. ""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

As for his difficulty handing over his phone, Smollett said that he was concerned about potential violations of his privacy. “I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my castmates’ numbers, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos,” he said. “I don't know what that's gonna be, to hand over my phone. And honestly, by then, inaccurate, false statements had already been put out there.”

In the end, the actor acknowledged that he wasn’t speaking out only for himself. He told Roberts that he wanted people to see the “truth” of hate, especially young people. “Everybody has their own idea,” he said. “Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community, young black children, to know how strong that they are.”

CHICAGO -- The Latest on the attack on 'Empire' cast member Jussie Smollett (all times local):

11:35 a.m.

Chicago police say they're interviewing two ""persons of interest"" who surveillance photos show were in the area where ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett says he was attacked last month.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Thursday that the two men aren't considered suspects but may have been in the area at the time.

Guglielmi told The Associated Press that the two men are the same people shown in surveillance photos released last month by police.

Smollett says two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before beating him and putting a rope around his neck when he was walking downtown early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi says the men were identified through the use of advanced technology, interviews with Smollett and witnesses, and transportation records.

9 a.m.

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett is responding to critics who question his report about being attacked in downtown Chicago last month.

Smollett told police two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, attacked him and put a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29. The 36-year-old actor is black and openly gay.

Smollett tells ABC News it's ""ridiculous"" to think he'd lie in his explanation for being outside at 2 a.m. in frigid Chicago weather.

He says he left the rope and clothes on when police arrived ""because I wanted them to see."" He says accusations that the attack was a date gone bad are offensive.

No arrests have been made. Police say they've not found surveillance video that shows the attack but that the investigation is ongoing.

Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi confirmed in a series of tweets that authorities discovered new footage of the two people and are working on determining if they are suspects in the case.

""Through s meticulous investigation, #ChicagoPolice detectives have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member.

Additionally, Guglielmi went on to clarify that the two individuals are not currently being investigated as the perpetrators of the crime, but that police do intend to question them about being in the vicinity when it took place.

""Important for media reporting: The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported. They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim,"" he explained.

Smollet has since addressed the attack in a statement published by Essence.

""Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” the statement began. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

Smollet then acknowledged the allegations that he may have fabricated the story, due to what some have claimed were inconsistent details in his recounting of the event.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" he said.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” Smollet continued. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Finally, the actor concluded his statement by signing it, ""With Love, respect & honor... Jussie."""

Smollett said late last month that he had been assaulted by two men yelling homophobic and racial slurs in downtown Chicago.

Smollett, 36, has told police that two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck while he was walking in the city’s Streeterville neighborhood around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29.

""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Smollett said he didn't want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf.

Smollett said he didn't initially want to give police his cellphone for their investigation because the device contains private content and phone numbers. Smollett gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation."

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there was no evidence to support a report by Chicago ABC7 television, which cited sources familiar with the investigation.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,” Guglielmi said in a tweet.

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” told police that two men shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of “Empire” released a statement saying: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Chicago police are questioning two “persons of interest” who surveillance cameras showed were in the area where Smollett said he was assaulted, Guglielmi said in a tweet on Thursday.

The two men know Smollett from working on “Empire” and were picked up at Chicago O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday night after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer told Chicago television station CBS2.

“They do know Jussie, they have worked with him on Empire,” attorney Gloria Schmidt said in an interview with CBS2. “They are baffled why they are persons of interest.”

Schmidt did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

The names of the two men have not been released and police have not found any video footage of the assault, which they say is being investigated as a hate crime.

“They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives,” Guglielmi said on Twitter."

9 a.m.

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett is responding to critics who question his report about being attacked in downtown Chicago last month.

Smollett told police two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, attacked him and put a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29. The 36-year-old actor is black and openly gay.

Smollett tells ABC News it's ""ridiculous"" to think he'd lie in his explanation for being outside at 2 a.m. in frigid Chicago weather.

Is it the attackers?” said Roberts. “It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks. At first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth, then that’s it. Because it’s the truth,” he said. “Then it became a thing of, like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.”

On the night of the incident, Smollett said he arrived home to find there was no food in his apartment. So, he went to Walgreens to find food and have a cigarette. Walgreens was closed, so he walked across the street to Subway. At that time, he received a call from his manager, Brandon Moore. After grabbing a “tuna sandwich and a salad,” as he was crossing the intersection, he heard someone shout Empire.

“I heard ‘Empire.’ And I don’t answer to Empire. My name ain’t Empire. And I didn’t answer. I kept walking. And then I heard ‘faggot Empire nigger.’ So, I turned around and I said, ‘Fuck did you just say to me?’ And then I see the attacker, masked. And he said, ‘This is MAGA country, nigger.’ Punches me right in the face. So, I punched his ass back.”

“And then, we started tussling, you know, it was very icy. And we ended up tussling by the stairs, fighting, fighting, fighting. There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back. Then it just stopped. And they ran off.”

After the scuffle, Smollett noticed that he had a rope wrapped around his neck and his sweater had been stained with bleach. He also noticed that his phone, which was still on a call with his manager Moore, had fallen out of his pocket onto the ground. Moore later corroborated Smollett’s account of the incident based on what he heard over the phone.

In the aftermath, Smollett faced criticism afterward for not immediately handing over his phone to authorities. But he told Roberts that it was simply to protect his information.

“I have private pictures and videos and numbers. My partners number, my family’s number, my castmates number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos, I don’t know what that’s gonna be to hand over my phone.”

Earlier this week, Smollett submitted phone records to the Chicago Police Department from within an hour of the incident. But CPD said they were “limited and heavily redacted,” according to Roberts.

When asked why he thought he was targeted, Smollett said it might be for his criticism of President Donald Trump.

“I could only go off of their words. I mean, who says ‘faggot Empire nigger,’ ‘This is MAGA country, nigger,’ ties a noose around your neck, and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight?” he asked. “It’s unbelievable to me that any of this has come to this. That every single thing that I have done, every single thing that I have cooperated with, somehow has gotten twisted into being some bull that it’s not.”"

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there was no evidence to support a report by Chicago ABC7 television, which cited sources familiar with the investigation.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,” Guglielmi said in a tweet.

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” told police that two men shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of “Empire” released a statement saying: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Chicago police are questioning two “persons of interest” who surveillance cameras showed were in the area where Smollett said he was assaulted, Guglielmi said in a tweet on Thursday.

The two men know Smollett from working on “Empire” and were picked up at Chicago O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday night after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer told Chicago television station CBS2.

“They do know Jussie, they have worked with him on Empire,” attorney Gloria Schmidt said in an interview with CBS2. “They are baffled why they are persons of interest.”

Schmidt did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

The names of the two men have not been released and police have not found any video footage of the assault, which they say is being investigated as a hate crime.

“They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives,” Guglielmi said on Twitter."

Sens. Kamala Harris, Corey Booker, and Tim Scott successfully passed legislation that will make lynching a hate crime. It now heads to the House.

The United States Senate cleared legislation that could finally make lynching a federal crime for the first time in the nation’s history.

Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Tim Scott (R-SC) introduced the bipartisan bill that aims to make lynching punishable under federal hate crime laws.

The federal law they hope to amend, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, was signed into law by President Obama in 2009.

Last December, the senators successfully passed a similar bill in the then-Republican-controlled Senate, but it failed to clear the House before the end of the 115th Congress.

Booker spoke on the floor about the importance of the anti-lynching legislation and referenced actor Jussie Smollet, hours after the actor was on Good Morning America. The openly gay star was the victim of an alleged hate crime last month where a rope was put around his neck by two white men, according to local police reports.

""Justice for the victims of lynching has been too long denied and as we look forward we must collectively in this body make a strong, unequivocal statement,"" the senator, who is running for U.S. president in the 2020 cycle, stated.

Harris, who has also pointed to Smollett’s attack as evidence to why their bill should become law, echoed these sentiments.

""We must confront hate in our country... We are now making clear there will be serious, swift and severe consequences,"" the senator, who is also a presidential hopeful, said on the floor.

Congress has attempted to pass anti-lynching legislation over 200 times since 1918, according to Harris. In 2005, the Senate passed a resolution apologizing to victims of lynching.

The measure will now head to the Democrat-controlled House and is expected to pass."

Mr Guglielmi said that the two men are the same people shown in surveillance photos released last month by police.

It came as Smollett responded to critics who are questioning his report about being attacked.

The 36-year-old actor is black and openly gay.

Smollett tells ABC News it’s “ridiculous” to think he’d lie in his explanation for being outside at 2am in frigid Chicago weather.

He says he left the rope and clothes on when police arrived “because I wanted them to see.” He says accusations that the attack was a date gone bad are offensive.

Choking back tears, he explained when asked why it took so long for him to contact the authorities: “There is a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.”

“I fought back,” he said. “I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f**k back. They ran off,’ I didn’t.”

The Chicago Police Department has put a dozen cops on the case, with help from the FBI, so they’re bound to crack it sooner or later. Assuming, of course, that anything happened to Smollett at all.

I won’t go so far as to affirmatively state, as some have, that Smollett is lying. It’s possible that it happened the way he said it happened. But it certainly isn’t plausible. The area where he claims he was attacked is blanketed with security cameras, yet there’s no footage of it. He claims his attackers recognized him from his TV show, Empire, and yet he also claims they yelled MAGA slogans at him. MAGA-heads who watch Empire? Really? And he claims it happened at 2 in the morning on one of the coldest days in Chicago history, and that his attackers just happened to be carrying a rope and a bottle of bleach.* Sorry, but it all smells as fishy as the tuna sub Smollett managed to hang onto throughout the ostensible ordeal. And the more outraged he gets that anybody could possibly doubt him, the more I doubt him.

Here’s Smollett on camera for the first time since the alleged assault, getting angry that you don’t believe his outlandish story with no evidence to back it up:

Jussie Smollett says he’s angry not only at his attackers but also at those who have questioned whether he’s telling the truth about alleged attack. pic.twitter.com/bRr1n4TO3J — TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 14, 2019

Smollett also said: “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more.”

And I feel like this says a lot more about Jussie Smollett than it says about people who aren’t obsessed with identity politics. He could’ve said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black or a transgender Eskimo lesbian with a wooden leg, and I’d still wonder why there’s no evidence to support it whatsoever.

And isn’t that an interesting way to phrase it? It’s not: “If I’d been attacked by a Muslim or a Mexican or a black person.” It’s: “If I’d said that.”

If this actually happened, I hope the attackers are brought to justice. If it didn’t happen, I hope Smollett is brought to justice for perpetrating a hoax. More likely, it will remain an unsolved mystery. That’s the best-case scenario for Smollett. He can always claim there’s no evidence that it didn’t happen, and the people who need to believe it will continue to believe it. He can continue to be a martyr, and he and his supporters can keep painting skeptics as racist homophobes who probably love that racist homophobe Trump.**

And keep in mind that Smollett has had it out for Trump since long, long before anybody even dreamed Trump could get elected POTUS:

Which one is more likely: Jussie Smollett was attacked by invisible, noose-wielding ninjas who love Donald Trump? Or Jussie Smollett hates Donald Trump so much that he staged a fake assault by MAGA-heads to draw attention to himself? To “raise awareness”?

Uh-oh. You’d better keep that to yourself. Occam’s razor is racist.

*Some people are also pointing out that Smollett refused to turn over his phone to police, but the libertarian part of my brain can’t blame him for that. I can’t decide if that’s the sort of thing a guilty man would do. Maybe? I just know I don’t want the cops poking around in my damn phone…

**People will believe what they want to believe, evidence be damned. Just ask a feminist about Brett Kavanaugh. Hell, ask any leftist about that kid in the red hat who smirked at an Indian. The truth is an afterthought, if not an outright impediment."

CHICAGO — Chicago police said Thursday night that local media reports that the attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

“(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he told the network. “Never did.”

(Reuters) - Chicago police contested media reports on Thursday that officers were investigating whether ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett staged being physically assaulted because he was being written out of the television show.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there was no evidence to support a report by Chicago ABC7 television, which cited sources familiar with the investigation.

""Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,"" Guglielmi said in a tweet.

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" told police that two men shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of ""Empire"" released a statement saying: ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Chicago police are questioning two ""persons of interest"" who surveillance cameras showed were in the area where Smollett said he was assaulted, Guglielmi said in a tweet on Thursday.

The two men know Smollett from working on ""Empire"" and were picked up at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday night after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer told Chicago television station CBS2.

""They do know Jussie, they have worked with him on Empire,"" attorney Gloria Schmidt said in an interview with CBS2. ""They are baffled why they are persons of interest.""

Schmidt did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

The names of the two men have not been released and police have not found any video footage of the assault, which they say is being investigated as a hate crime.

""They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives,"" Guglielmi said on Twitter.

Chicago police say they’re interviewing two “persons of interest” who surveillance photos show were in the area where “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett says he was attacked last month.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Thursday that the two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area at the time.

Guglielmi told The Associated Press that the two men are the same people shown in surveillance photos released last month by police.

Smollett says two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before beating him and putting a rope around his neck when he was walking downtown early on Jan. 29.

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett is responding to critics who question his report about being attacked in downtown Chicago last month.

Smollett told police two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, attacked him and put a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29. The 36-year-old actor is black and openly gay.

Smollett tells ABC News it’s “ridiculous” to think he’d lie in his explanation for being outside at 2 a.m. in frigid Chicago weather.

He says he left the rope and clothes on when police arrived “because I wanted them to see.” He says accusations that the attack was a date gone bad are offensive.

No arrests have been made. Police say they’ve not found surveillance video that shows the attack but that the investigation is ongoing.

Smollett told police two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, attacked him and put a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29. The 36-year-old actor is black and openly gay.

Smollett tells ABC News it’s “ridiculous” to think he’d lie in his explanation for being outside at 2 a.m. in frigid Chicago weather.

He says he left the rope and clothes on when police arrived “because I wanted them to see.” He says accusations that the attack was a date gone bad are offensive.

No arrests have been made. Police say they’ve not found surveillance video that shows the attack but that the investigation is ongoing.

CHICAGO (AP) — The Latest on the attack on ‘Empire’ cast member Jussie Smollett (all times local):

7:30 p.m.

Producers of the television drama “Empire” are disputing reports that Jussie Smollett’s character is being written off the show.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Thursday night calling the reports “patently ridiculous.” The statement says Smollett “remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

The statement comes after Chicago police said local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

Smollett has said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before beating him and putting a rope around his neck when he was walking downtown early on Jan. 29.

7:15 p.m.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says local media reports that the attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

The reports surfaced as investigators were questioning two “persons of interest” who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area where Smollett says the attack occurred.

Guglielmi says police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. Guglielmi adds that Johnson said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Guglielmi told The Associated Press that the two men are the same people shown in surveillance photos released last month by police.

(Reuters) - Chicago police contested media reports on Thursday that officers were investigating whether ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett staged being physically assaulted because he was being written out of the television show.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there was no evidence to support a report by Chicago ABC7 television, which cited sources familiar with the investigation.

""Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,"" Guglielmi said in a tweet.

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" told police that two men shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of ""Empire"" released a statement saying: ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Chicago police are questioning two ""persons of interest"" who surveillance cameras showed were in the area where Smollett said he was assaulted, Guglielmi said in a tweet on Thursday.

The two men know Smollett from working on ""Empire"" and were picked up at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday night after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer told Chicago television station CBS2.

""They do know Jussie, they have worked with him on Empire,"" attorney Gloria Schmidt said in an interview with CBS2. ""They are baffled why they are persons of interest.""

Schmidt did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

The names of the two men have not been released and police have not found any video footage of the assault, which they say is being investigated as a hate crime.

""They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives,"" Guglielmi said on Twitter."

Smollett, who is gay, has said he was walking to a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. Jan. 29 when he was attacked by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hung a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him. In his first interview about the incident, Smollett gave a detailed account of the attack on Good Morning America Thursday, saying the first attacker was masked and he only glimpsed the second attacker as he ran away. He said he fought back and later gave police a description as best as he was able.

Chicago police have said Smollett, 36, has been cooperative and they consider him to be a victim in the case. But as days passed with no video of the incident or suspects emerging, questions have swirled online and in the media about Smollett's account. On GMA, Smollett blasted those who have doubted him, insisting his story has remained consistent.

""I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,"" Smollett told GMA.

Smollett said the attack has left him ""forever changed.""

""I will never be the man that this did not happen to,"" Smollett said.

Smollett told GMA he believes the two men seen in the surveillance video are his attackers. He grew emotional when asked how he would heal if the men are never found.

""I understand how difficult it will be to find them but we gotta,"" Smollett said. ""I still want to believe with everything that has happened, that there's something called justice.""

Smollett blasted inaccurate media reports, including that he said his attackers were wearing ""MAGA"" hats, an acronym for President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. He said the attackers yelled ""this is 'MAGA' country,"" but never said they were wearing ""MAGA"" hats.

""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Jussie Smollett breaks silence on alleged attack

He also said he resented the inaccurate narrative that the attack stemmed from a ""date gone bad.""

""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive,"" Smollett told GMA.

When asked why he initially hesitated to call police, Smollett said ""there's a level of pride there.""

""We live in a society where as a gay man we are considered to be weak,"" Smollett said. ""I am not weak, and we as a people are not weak.""

Smollett said his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called police for him. Smollett told GMA he kept the rope around his neck as he waited for police to arrive because ""I wanted them to see.""

Police are investigating where the rope may have originated, reports CBS Chicago. Sources also told the station police are police are investigating a hot sauce bottle with clear liquid found near the scene that smelled of bleach.

Speaking to GMA, Smollett said he didn't turn over his phone to investigators because it contained personal information and numbers for friends, family and cast mates. Smollett turned over ""limited and heavily redacted"" phone records to police detectives Tuesday, CBS Chicago reports. Smollett told GMA he was on the phone with his manager when the attack happened.

Guglielmi said Smollett turned over a PDF file containing a redacted record of phone calls, but he said the redactions were ""extreme,"" according to the station. Police have said the records are insufficient for a criminal investigation.

In a statement, Smollett's lawyer said the redactions were ""intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.""

""Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police. Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police,"" the statement said. ""Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie's attackers and bring them to justice."""

Chicago police say they have identified two ""persons of interest"" in the assault case involving Jussie Smollett, just hours after ABC's ""Good Morning America"" aired an interview with the ""Empire"" actor in which he described his alleged attack.

""After a meticulous investigation with the use of advance technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records, detectives have identified two persons of interest in the Empire cast member case. No further information available at this time,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. In a tweet Thursday, Guglielmi said that the individuals that were seen on surveillance tape images released last month ""are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned.""

In the interview that aired Thursday morning, Smollett told Robin Roberts he is ""pissed off"" following the attack, which Chicago police are investigating as a potential hate crime.

The interview marked Smollett's first detailed public account of the attack, which police say happened in Chicago around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. Police say Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was assaulted by two ""unknown offenders"" who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on the actor and wrapped a rope around his neck.

Chicago police have not made any arrests and have not found any video of the alleged assault, leading some people to doubt Smollett's account of what happened. Smollett, who wiped away tears throughout the interview, told Roberts he is angry about the assault, but also about people not believing his story.

""At first, it was like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth,"" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that, like how do you not believe that. It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

Smollett told Roberts that before the alleged attack, he had gone to a Subway restaurant shortly after landing in Chicago, where the Fox drama had been filming.

He was on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, as he left the restaurant. As he crossed the street, Smollett said he heard someone yell ""Empire,"" which he ignored. It was after hearing homophobic and racial slurs that he turned around and confronted a man in a ski mask.

Smollett said the attacker told him ""this is MAGA country"" and used a racial slur before punching him in the face. ""So I punched his a -- right back.""

""We started tussling,"" Smollett said. A second attacker began kicking him in the back. ""Then it just stopped and they ran off. ""

Smollett said his manager was still on the phone, which had fallen out of his pocket. He told Moore he had just been jumped. Then, Smollett said, he looked down and saw a rope.

""I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming,"" Smollett said. ""And I said 'there's a (expletive) rope around my neck.""

Police previously told The Post that a thin, white rope was still around Smollett's neck when they first came into contact with him about 40 minutes after the attack. He told Roberts he was only able to give a body description of his attackers because the entire encounter happened so fast. ""It felt like minutes, but it was probably like 30 seconds, honestly,"" Smollett said.

The actor said he doesn't ""have any doubt"" that the two people in the surveillance image released by police are his alleged attackers.

""I want that video found so badly"" -- for multiple reasons, Smollett told Roberts. ""No, 1, I want them to find the people that did it, No. 2, I want them to stop being able to say 'alleged attack.'

""I want them to see that I fought back,"" Smollett continued, his voice breaking. ""And I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f--- back.""

""I didn't run off. They did,"" Smollett said, referring to his attackers.

Smollett has faced increased scrutiny this week amid reports that he gave redacted phone records to police. A spokeswoman for the Chicago Police Department confirmed to The Post that they ""received limited and redacted phone records from the victim.""

The spokeswoman said the records will be analyzed by detectives, who will follow up with Smollett if additional information is needed. She added that Moore, who police consider a key witness because he said he could hear the attackers over the phone, ""has refused to let police examine his phone.""

Smollett's publicist released a statement this week noting that ""any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack."" The statement emphasized that Smollett is a victim and that he has cooperated with police throughout the investigation.

""Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible,"" Smollett's publicist said in the statement.

Earlier this month, Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson told Chicago's ABC 7 that Smollett had ""been very cooperative and we have no reason, at this point, to think that he's not being genuine with us.""

""I have fought for love. I'm an advocate. I respect too much the people -- who I am now one of those people -- who have been attacked in any way,"" Smollett said during his ""GMA"" interview. ""You do such a disservice when you lie about something like this.""

""If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal?"" Roberts asked the actor.

""I don't know,"" Smollett said, as his eyes filled with tears."" Let's just hope that they are. Let's not go there yet.""

""I understand how difficult it will be to find them, but we gotta,"" he added. ""I still want to believe with every thing that has happened that there's something called justice.""

UPDATES

TMZ reported early this afternoon that police are re-questioning Smollett and another actor who has appeared on Empire: “Sources connected to the case tell us the actor, not Jussie, was picked up by Chicago PD Wednesday night right after he flew into O’Hare Airport. We’re told Jussie was brought in Thursday morning for additional questioning. Another man who was with the actor at O’Hare was also taken in for questioning.”

Guglielmi tweeted following TMZ’s report: “To safeguard the investigation, details about the case including timelines & backgrounds of those being questioned by police will not be released or commented on while detectives question persons of interest.

He spoke with Good Morning America's Robin Roberts, explaining that he's ""pissed off,"" both about the attackers and by those who have questioned the validity of his story.

Smollett was attacked on January 29 near a subway station by two masked men shouting racist and homophobic slurs. Some voiced doubts about the events, after police were unable to find surveillance footage of the attack and because Smollett, who claims he was on the phone with his manager during the attack, initially refused to hand over his phone to the police. He later submitted ""heavily redacted"" phone records to the police. Despite this, according to the New York Times, Chicago law enforcement has said that they have no reason to doubt Smollett's story.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone Black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,"" Smollett told ABC's Robin Roberts. ""A lot more.""

He described his realization that people were challenging his story: ""At first it was a thing of like, if I tell the truth,... then that's it, because it's the truth. Then it became a thing of... ""oh, how do you doubt that, how do you not believe that, it's the truth?"" And then it became a thing of like, ""oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

Smollett gave an extremely detailed account of the attack, explaining that he had left his apartment to get some food, and was on the phone with his manager, Brendan Moore, when he heard someone call ""Empire!,"" which he didn't respond to. He stopped when he heard a racial slur. ""So I turned around and said 'What the f**k did you just say to me' and I see the attacker masked,"" Smollett said, appearing to get emotional. ""He said 'This MAGA country n****r' and he punched me in the face so I punched his a** back."" After the attackers ran away, Smollett says it wasn't until he picked up his cell phone, which had fallen to the ground, the call with Moore still running, that he realized one of the attackers had slipped a rope around his neck. ""I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming 'There's a f***ing rope around my neck,"" he said.

Smollett explained his reluctance to hand over his phone records:

""I have private pictures and videos and numbers,"" Smollett said. ""My partner's number. My family's number. My castmates' numbers. My friends' numbers. My private email. My private songs. My private voice memos.""

The police have released images of two possible suspects caught on surveillance camera, who Smollett said he's convinced are his attackers. Smollett said. ""...When that was released, I was like, 'O.K., we're getting somewhere.' I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. Never did.""

He expressed frustration with the stories spurred by the police's lack of leads: ""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I so resent that narrative,"" Smollett said. ""I'm not going to go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous and it's offensive.""

""I want that video found so badly, for probably four reasons. Number one, I want them to find the people that do it. Number two, I want them to stop being able to say 'alleged attack.' ""Number three, I want them to see that I fought back. And I want a little gay boy, who might watch this, to see that I fought the f*ck back.""

Smollett also responded to Trump's acknowledgement of the attack. Trump said to reporters that the attack was ""horrible. It doesn't get worse."" As the New York Times points out, however, Donald Trump Jr. later retweeted an article questioning Smollett's refusal to turn in his cell phone.

""I saw it. I don't know what to say to that. You know, I appreciate him not brushing over it."" said Smollett. Smollett also confirmed that he believes the racist hate mail sent to Fox studios the week before the attack, which read ""Jussie Smollett you will die"" and included a drawing of a stick figure hanging from a tree, is related to the incident.

The actor teared up while he speaking about his message for fans: ""I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community, young Black children to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky."" ""I will never be the man that this did not happen to,"" Smollett said. ""I am forever changed."""

Jussie Smollett sat down with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America for his first interview since the racist and homophobic attack against him in Chicago last month.

In the interview, which aired this morning, Smollett tells Roberts he’s “pissed off” about all the misinformation that’s been circulating since the January 29 assault, as well as at the people who refuse to believe him.

“At first it was, if I tell the truth, then that’s it, because it’s the truth,” he says. “Then it became, how can you not believe that, it’s the truth. Then it became, oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, but you don’t even want to see the truth.”

Smollett goes on to say the fact that so many people automatically branded his story #fake news “says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

He continues: “For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f*ggot, they called me a n*gger. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them.

When asked by Roberts why he didn’t initially hand over his phone to police, Smollett explains, quite reasonably, “They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but I’m not gonna do that, because I have private pictures and videos and numbers.”

“My partner’s number, my family’s number, my cast mates’ numbers, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

Shortly after the interview aired, Chicago Police announced they had identified “persons of interest in the area” who are now being questioned by authorities, although they they are “not yet suspects.”

(P.S. For those who still refuse to believe Smollett’s story, consider this: Why would a popular actor on a hit TV show who is at the height of career make something like this up? What does he possibly have to gain?)

Smollett detailed his attack in an exclusive interview with “Good Morning America.” According to Jussie, he was on the phone with his manager when he was punched in the face by an attacker, and retaliated by punching back. He continued, “We started tussling… it was very icy. We ended up tussling by the stairs, fighting, fighting, fighting. There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back — and then it just stopped.”

It wasn’t until the attackers ran off that Jussie noticed the “rope around my neck.” As for why he didn’t notice it before, Jussie explained, “It was so fast,” adding about the attack, “It felt like minutes but it was probably like 30 seconds.”

Jussie admitted he is “pissed off” at doubters of his story. He said, “It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, 'cause it's the truth.' Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.'”

When asked why he hesitated calling the police after the incident, Smollett explained, “There's a level of pride there. We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered, somehow, to be weak, and I'm not weak. I am not weak. And we, as a people, are not weak.""

After the incident, police released a images of two persons of interest wanted for questioning. For the first time, Smollett affirmed he believes the shadowy figures are his attackers. He said, “I was there. For me, when that was released, I was like, 'Okay, we are getting somewhere.' I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. I never did.""

Jussie also explained why he didn’t want to hand over his phone to police, saying, “I have private pictures and videos and numbers. My partner’s number, my family’s numbers, my castmates’ numbers, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my songs.”

Of the aftermath, the 36-year-old said, “I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed. I don't subscribe to the idea everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and the responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.""

The Chicago Police Department's Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi has also given an update on the investigation, tweeting that through a ""meticulous"" investigation, ""Detectives have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member. These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned. Investigation continues."""

The “Empire” actor was subjected to a “possible hate crime” last month, when two assailants allegedly hurled homophobic abuse before punching him, pouring an unknown chemical substance over him. The alleged attackers then put a rope around his neck, simulating a noose. Not only is Smollett still angry about what happened to him, but he is also annoyed that there have been so many false rumors surrounding the incident.

Speaking out for the first time in a preview of his upcoming interview on “Good Morning America,” he fumed, “I’m p—– off.”

Asked why by host Robin Roberts, he replied, “It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks. It’s not that you don’t believe this is the truth; you don’t want to see this is the truth.

“It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.’ “

Earlier this week, a spokesperson for the 36-year-old star — who was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack — defended him after it was claimed he had turned over his phone records to police. However, they were limited and heavily redacted, so they did not “meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

The actor’s representative insisted he had been as cooperative as possible.

They said in a statement: “Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.

“Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim.

“We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief, and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.

“With Love, respect & honor…Jussie (sic).”"

Two brothers from Nigeria have been identified as persons of interest in connection with the alleged attack on ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett, Chicago police said late Thursday.

Officials said the two are affiliated with the show ""Empire"" and were detained on their arrival at O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday.

The police gave no further information about their specific roles or connections to the show but said the investigation continues.

Smollett filed a report with Chicago police on Jan. 29 stating that two men hurled racist and homophobic slurs before beating him. He also told police that his attackers poured a chemical, possibly bleach, over him and put a noose around his neck.

Earlier Thursday, police said that ""through meticulous investigation"" they had identified two persons of interest.

""These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a tweet.

Later, police said they searched at least one property in connection with their investigation but that they still have no motive for the attack. Police have said they are investigating the alleged attack against Smollett, who is black and gay, as a possible hate crime.

In a statement to NBC News earlier on Thursday, a representative for Smollett welcomed the identification of two persons of interest.

""We are pleased there is progress in the case and are waiting to hear further details,"" his representative said.

In his first interview about the incident, the actor told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he was angry about the alleged attack and at those who doubted his story.

Social media users began to cast doubt over his claims after police said they were not able to find video of the alleged attack.

""It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it, 'cause it's the truth,"" Smollett said. ""Then, it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that?' Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It's the truth.""

""And then, it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth,'"" he said.

Police have said they have not found surveillance video that shows the alleged assault and battery, but they then released images of the ""potential persons of interest"" from a surveillance camera near where Smollett says he was attacked.

Chicago Police Supt. Eddie T. Johnson has said he has no reason to believe Smollett is ""not being genuine with"" investigators.

As for Smollett, the actor said the incident has left a deep mark.

ABC News(CHICAGO) — Police in Chicago have identified and are questioning two “persons of interest” in an alleged racial attack on actor Jussie Smollett.

Neither of the individuals has been charged with any crime related to the alleged attack, and there is no evidence that they were involved in any attack on the actor, police said.

Chicago police used surveillance technology to track the movements of the two individuals using cameras, public transportation records, and corroborating information provided by Smollett, according to a spokesman.

“We know who they are and have brought them in for questioning,” a Chicago Police Department spokesman said on Friday.

Late last month, the “Empire” star told police he was brutally attacked in what authorities are calling a suspected hate crime.

He was subsequently hospitalized and released, local authorities said.

Smollett told police that the men also allegedly poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, police said. The rope was still around Smollett’s neck when police spoke to him, officials said.

And while Chicago Police have told ABC News that Smollett is only being viewed as the victim in this investigation, the actor is still bothered by some chatter online that his story may have changed in any way.

In his first interview since police say he was attacked last month, the singer and actor said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” Smollett, 36, told ABC News’ Robin Roberts. “And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth,” he added.

Smollett, who portrays a gay musician on Fox’s “Empire,” said the attack happened on Jan. 29, at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant in Chicago. He told police that two attackers gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, according to an initial incident report.

He said the attackers put a noose around his neck, poured an unknown substance, likely bleach, on him and used their hands, feet and teeth as weapons in the assault, according to the report, which ABC News obtained last week via a Freedom of Information Act request. Smollett said the attackers also yelled, “This is MAGA country,” during the attack — a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan.

The singer said he sustained injuries to his clavicle bone and bruised ribs during the attack, but some still questioned if he made the story up.

“For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,” Smollett said. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—-, they called me a n—-. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said earlier reporting by various media outlets claiming his attackers were wearing MAGA hats was inaccurate.

Others suggested that he may have lied in his explanation for being outside at 2 a.m. in sub-zero Chicago weather, but Smollett said “that’s ridiculous.”

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said.

“I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive,” he added. Smollett also confirmed reports that he was initially reluctant to contact the police or handover his cellphone to help with the investigation.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that,” the singer said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

“I don’t know what that’s gonna be, to hand over my phone for — and honestly, by then, inaccurate, false statements had already been put out there,” he added.

The musician said he’s hopeful that police will track down the suspects. He also believes the two potential persons of interest in a photo released by police in the days after the attack are the perpetrators.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” Smollett said. “Never did.”

But there’s no doubt in his mind that the attack was racially motivated.

“I could only go off of their words. I mean, who says, “f—– ‘Empire’ n—–,” “This is MAGA country, n—–,” ties a noose around your neck, and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight?” he asked. “It’s unbelievable to me that anything of this has come to this. That every single thing that I have done, every single thing that I have cooperated with, somehow has gotten twisted into being some bull that it’s not.”

Smollett decided to speak out so people could hear the “truth.”

“I think people need to hear the truth,” he said. “‘Cause everybody has their own idea. Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community — young, black children — to know how strong that they are.”

After the 36-year-old Empire star was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in late January, he gave his first on-camera interview on Thursday’s Good Morning America with Robin Roberts.

At an emotional point in the interview, Smollett reveals the reason he initially hesitated to call the police.

""There’s a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak, and I’m not weak and we as a people are not weak,” he says, looking visibly upset.

In the interview, Smollett details the night of the attack, noting he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon, when he first heard his attackers approach.

""I heard as I was crossing the intersection, I heard, ‘Empire!’ I don’t answer to Empire,” he recalls. ""My name ain’t Empire. And I didn’t answer. I kept walking and then I heard ‘f****t Empire n****r’ so I turned around and said, ‘The f**k did you just say to me?’”

Smollett says that at first he was just dealing with one person, noting, ""I see the attacker, masked. He said, ‘This MAGA country n****r,’ punches me right in the face. So I punched his a** back. And then we started tussling. It was very icy and we ended up tussling by the stairs. Fighting, fighting, fighting, there was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back. Then it just stopped and they ran off, and I saw where they ran.”

The actor notes that he then picked his phone back up and told his manager what had happened and it wasn’t until then that he noticed there was a rope around his neck.

“It was so fast,” Smollett explains of his delayed reaction to the rope. “It felt like minutes, but it probably was like 30 seconds, honestly. I can’t tell you, honestly. I noticed the rope and I started screaming. I said, ‘There’s a f**king rope around my neck.’""

Because his attackers were wearing ski masks and heavy winter clothing, Smollett has had a difficult time offering up a description to the police.

""I saw his stature, I gave the description as best as I could,” he says, noting he can’t recall the man’s eye color. ""You have to also understand it’s Chicago in winter. People can wear ski masks and nobody’s going to question that.”

He says that the image that was released by the police of persons of interest has convinced him that those were his attackers.

""I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them, never did,” he says.

Smollett also explains why he refused to turn over his phone initially, saying, ""I’m sorry but I’m not going to do that because I have private pictures and videos and numbers, my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmates' numbers, my friend’s numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos. I don’t know what that’s going to be to hand over my phone. And honestly by then, inaccurate false statements had been put out there.”

One of the statements that Smollett claims was false was that he identified his attackers as wearing MAGA hats.

""I never said that. I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he says. ""I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of a racist sundae.”

Other rumors he’s heard included that the attack was simply “a date gone wrong.”

""I so resent that narrative. I’m not going to go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody, that’s ridiculous and it’s offensive,”he says. ""Yes, there’s Grindr, yes there’s Jack’d, yes there’s all of these things, which I have not been on in years. I can admit that I was on that back in the day, I was single.""

He notes that his injuries left him “in a lot of pain,” but added, “Nothing was cracked. I walked into the hospital. I walked out of the hospital.”

As for what motivated the attack, Smollett says, ""I can only go off of their words.”

He also addresses President Donald Trump’s response to the attack, which Trump called “horrible.”

""I don’t know what to say to that,” Smollett says. ""I appreciate him not brushing over it.""

The FOX star notes that he feels it’s his responsibility to speak out after having such a terrible thing happen to him.

""I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed,” he says. ""And I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.""

He adds, ""I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community, young black children to know how strong that they are, to know the power that they hold in their little pinkie.""

Smollett is desperate for video footage of his attack to be found, saying, ""I want that video found so badly for probably four reasons. Number one I want them to find the people that did it. Number two, I want them to stop being able to say ‘alleged attack.’ Number three, I want them to see that I fought back. And I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought back… They ran off. I didn’t.”

""Learn to fight.

He clarifies, ""I am not advocating violence, at all, so let’s be clear about that. If you’re gonna die, fight until you do, because if you don’t fight, you have no chance.”

When asked how he’d feel if his attackers were never caught, Smollett got tearful.

""I want to believe, with everything that has happened, that there is something called justice."" @JussieSmollett says he doesn't know how he will heal if his attackers aren't found. https://t.co/b5efiP0JCGpic.twitter.com/Shtw0qCQOZ — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 14, 2019

""Let’s just hope that they are. Let’s not go there yet,” he says, adding that he’d be “angry” if they were never found. ""They just get to go free and go about their life and possibly attack someone else and I’m here left with the aftermath of this bull? That’s not cool to me. That’s not OK. I understand how difficult it will be to find them, but we gotta. I still want to believe with everything that’s happened that there’s something called justice.""

Prince Philip will not be prosecuted for the car accident he was involved in last month.

The Crown Prosecution Service said Thursday that the Duke of Edinburgh will not face any charges over the crash near the Sandringham estate, which left a woman in another vehicle with a broken wrist.

Philip, 97, gave up his driver’s licence following the incident, and apologized to the other car’s occupants — two women and a baby.

“We took into account all of the circumstances in this case, including the level of culpability, the age of the driver and the surrender of the driving licence,” said Chris Long, Chief Crown Prosecutor from CPS East of England.

Ultimately, the CPS affirmed, it wasn’t in the “public interest” to prosecute the duke.

On Jan. 17, Philip was left without injury but shaken after the Land Rover he was driving ended up on its side following the collision with a Kia.

Two days later, he was spotted out driving in a brand new Rover and he was photographed not wearing a seat belt. Police gave the royal “advice” after public outcry.

Police said the advice given to Philip was “in line with our standard response when being made aware of such images showing this type of offence.”

He then wrote the letter of apology to Emma Fairweather, the woman whose wrist was broken, and acknowledged the intensity of the accident. (The letter was originally published in the Sunday Mirror.)

“I would like you to know how very sorry I am for my part in the accident,” he wrote. “The sun was shining low over the main road. In normal conditions I would have no difficulty in seeing traffic coming… but I can only imagine that I failed to see the car coming, and I am very contrite about the consequences.”

The duke retired from public life in August 2017, and is four months away from his 98th birthday.

You Should, Too.",[],https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/2019/02/14/jussie-750x_0.jpg,"['smollett', 'oped', 'hate', 'jussie', 'smolletts', 'empire', 'chicago', 'lgbtq', 'attack', 'believe', 'incident', 'doesnt', 'neck']","The views represented in this op-ed are the author's own.

The sentiments of doubt cast at Jussie Smollett since he says he faced a homophobic and racist attack is disappointing, to say the least. Somehow, I thought, or at least hoped, society at large was at the point of believing victims, what with the enduring impact of the #MeToo movement. But what these seemingly malicious and unfounded rumors, criticisms, and allegations of deception lodged at the Empire actor tell me is that those of us perpetually at the bottom of the socio-cultural stepladder — Black LGBTQ+ people — still aren’t granted the apparent, simplest of luxuries afforded our counterparts: the benefit of the doubt.

Smollett was assaulted in the early morning of January 29 on his way to grab food at a nearby Subway. Identified as “that faggot Empire n*****,” he says he was attacked by two men who also put a noose around his neck and poured a clear liquid, believed to be bleach, on him. Simultaneously, they yelled this was “MAGA country.” Brandon Z. Moore, Smollett’s music manager, was on the phone with the actor during the attack and confirmed the language that Smollett says his assailants used.

“I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken,” Smollett said while speaking for the first time about the incident on stage February 2 at a previously-scheduled concert in West Hollywood. “I went to the doctor immediately. [Smollett’s creative director who was at his apartment] Frank Gatson drove. I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care obviously. And above all, I fought the fuck back.”

The Chicago Police Department said at the onset that they are investigating the incident as a “possible hate crime.” While plenty of surveillance footage has been reviewed, including proof that Smollett did return to the lobby of his apartment with a rope around his neck, nothing has yet been obtained that captures the attack itself. It was also confirmed that a letter was sent to the studio where Empire is filmed on January 22 addressed to Smollett filled with a white powder. The substance was later determined to be aspirin. The letter said ""You will die Black fag” with a gun pointed toward a stick figure hanging from a noose. Police have not said if the two incidents are related, and so far they are being investigated separately. On January 30, officials released photos of two “persons of interest” who were in the general vicinity of where the attack took place.

As word continued to spread in the hours after the incident, countless celebrities and public officials expressed concern and support for Smollett, using #JusticeForJussie, including Empire director Lee Daniels, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and Ellen DeGeneres and even Kevin Hart. Almost simultaneously, however, people began to voice their skepticism of Smollett’s account on social media and beyond.

Some have snidely joked that the situation was probably a Grindr hookup gone wrong, Smollett directly responded Thursday in his first interview about the incident, by saying, “I so resent that narrative… That’s ridiculous and it’s offensive.”

""I saw the rope burn around my neck, and then I smelled bleach."" @JussieSmollett says he kept the rope and his clothes on until police got there so he could show them exactly what type of attack this was. https://t.co/b5efiP0JCG pic.twitter.com/gaO1xZlAFL — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 14, 2019

Others, particularly conservatives and Donald Trump supporters, have twisted the details of the incident to support a narrative that Smollett “pretend[ed] a polar vortex MAGA hate crime occurred,” as tweeted by Fox News’ Candace Owens. Still more found it questionable that the actor-singer did not turn over his phone to authorities when requested. (This week he did provide a copy of his phone records from within an hour of the attack to the police who have said it’s “limited and heavily redacted,” an effort Smollett’s team said in a statement, “intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.)

I suppose a healthy skepticism is warranted. As a journalist, our default is to question everything, and we’ve spent the better part of the last three years encouraging greater media literacy and uplifting the importance of independent verification and fact-checking in the fight against the proliferation of fake news. And it’s not all that absurd to think that a celebrity might want attention so badly that they make up a story, especially one with such on-the-nose details, like two clearly racist, homophobic, white guys screaming this is “MAGA country.” But many of the hot takes thus far don’t seem to be constructive or with the intent of confirming what took place.

While it’s important to allow police to investigate this case, it doesn’t mean the Chicago Police Department doesn’t need a healthy dose of skepticism itself, as it’s headed by Eddie Johnson who in 2016, as a deputy chief, defended the fatal shooting of Rekia Boyd as a justified use of force, according to The Intercept. The subtle digs from the department noting that while Smollett is still being treated as the victim, he would be held responsible if he filed a false police report sure seems like a deliberate move.

What this seemingly pervasive hesitancy to believe Smollett says to me is that we as a country are still in denial. I think many of Smollett’s detractors don’t want to seriously grapple with the idea that our post ""post-racial"" society is in indeed still very racial, even in the liberal-presenting city of Chicago. My spirit tells me that, for some, it’s easier to ignore that Donald Trump’s presidency has thrown a rock at the beehive of white cis hetero patriarchy and supremacy hanging over our heads when the person being gay-bashed or having a noose placed around their neck isn’t someone broadcast weekly into their living rooms. And for the Black LGBTQ+ folks among the naysayers, my gut says that it just hurts too much for us to be faced in such a public way with the reality that visibility alone doesn’t guarantee our safety, and so we jest to deflect the true state of our lived experiences.

The facts are that hate crimes against LGBTQ+ people are on the rise, in number and severity, and the “normalization of hate violence,” according the New York City Anti-Violence Project, contributes to some people not reporting. Considering the way Smollett has been treated, it’s no wonder even he initially didn’t want to contact the police or go public, a similar sentiment that’s risen out of the #MeToo movement with people sharing stories of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse, in some instances, decades after it happened. And while it is possible and valid to reserve positive or negative comment until the police end their investigation, having faith in a legal system built on the subjugation of the very marginalized communities to which Smollett belongs seems somewhat futile.

I’ve decided to come from a place of believing people who say they’ve been victimized, especially when they’re people of color and LGBTQ+ because we know that living at the intersections of multiple oppressions compounds the pressure of silence. So, the resulting courage it takes to speak up and out against individuals and the systems that enable and embolden them is insurmountable. It seems like I might be in the minority, but doing the opposite is what got us into our current socio-political shitstorm.

CHICAGO — ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett is responding to critics who question his report about being attacked in downtown Chicago last month.

Smollett told police two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, attacked him and put a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29. The 36-year-old actor is black and openly gay.

Smollett tells ABC News it's ""ridiculous"" to think he'd lie in his explanation for being outside at 2 a.m. in frigid Chicago weather.

He says he left the rope and clothes on when police arrived ""because I wanted them to see."" He says accusations that the attack was a date gone bad are offensive.

No arrests have been made. Police say they've not found surveillance video that shows the attack but that the investigation is ongoing."

The bill previously passed the Senate in December, but it did not clear the then-GOP controlled House before the end of the 115th Congress. It passed on Thursday by a voice vote.

Booker said that ""lynching is not a relic of the past,"" pointing to the attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago.

""Justice for the victims of lynching has been too long denied, and as we look forward we must collectively in this body make a strong, unequivocal statement,"" he added.

Harris, speaking from the Senate floor, added that lynching is a part of the country's ""uncomfortable history"" that had never been ""truly acknowledged"" or ""reconciled"" with.

""We must confront hate in our country. ... We are now making clear there will be serious, swift and severe consequences,"" said Harris, who along with Booker is running for the party's 2020 nomination for president.

Congress has tried but failed to pass anti-lynching legislation roughly 200 times since 1918, according to Harris's office. In 2005, the Senate passed a resolution apologizing to lynching victims.

But, addressing the 2005 vote, the Senate legislation says that while an apology ""moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become central to a new understanding, on which improved racial relations can be forged,"" legislation criminalizing lynching is still ""wholly necessary and appropriate.""

The measure will now go to the House."

The star of Empire gave his first interview since the reported hate crime. He says that he'd be believed if the perpertrators weren't white.

Jussie Smollett spoke out in his first interview on Thursday morning about any suspicion related to the reported hate crime he faced last month in Chicago that has sparked an outpouring of both support and criticism of the actor.

In an exclusive interview with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, the star of Empire said he feels that if the perpetrators weren’t white, he would be believed.

""I have to acknowledge the lies and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,"" Smollett told GMA. ""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett used his time on the morning show to speak on much of the reporting that has emerged since news broke of his attack and to share that he believes the two men in blurry photos released by police are the perpetrators.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” Smollett said. The actor also used the interview to speak on recent reporting related to his phone records and misreporting surrounding the attack.

Earlier this week, the actor’s phone records that detail his calls during the night of the attack were rejected by local police as their investigation continues.

""We are very appreciative of the victim's cooperation; however, the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told The Advocate.

Smollett stated in interviews with local police immediately after the attack that he was speaking on the phone with his manager, who could corroborate many aspects of the incident. These records could help investigators looking to piece together the timeline of the January attack.

The actor maintained his defense on GMA that he hasn’t handed over the phone due to it holding personal information of others who are unrelated to this incident.

""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry, but — I'm not gonna do that,"" the actor said. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my castmate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""

Smollett said that earlier reports from other outlets that stated the actor told police that his assailants were wearing MAGA hats is inaccurate.

""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said, referring to the hats. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f----, they called me a n----. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

The actor did restate that the attackers used the president’s slogan while attacking him.

""This is MAGA country,"" the men then yelled, according to interviews conducted by the Chicago police with the actor after the attack, which have been confirmed by The Advocate. Smollett’s manager has told police he heard this language among racial and homophobic slurs.

A video of Smollett with a rope around his neck returning to his building after the reported incident has been recovered by the police but has yet to be released. Local police say they will not release this footage until the investigation is finished.

The FBI’s separate investigation into hate mail addressed to Smollett with an image of a man being shot is also still ongoing. The two agencies will not comment on whether these incidents are related.

In the wake of the interview, LGBTQ groups have already begun to reaffirm their support of the actor, who they say is a victim of a hate crime and say he is now being revictimized by speculation in the wake of the attacks.

“Jussie Smollett was victimized first in a hate-motivated and violent attack in Chicago and has since been doubly victimized as the subject of speculation by the media industry and broader culture,” GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement to The Advocate. “Jussie’s experience is sadly not unique in today’s America and we all must lock arms to change that.”

Last year was the deadliest year on record for LGBTQ people of color, according to the National Anti-Violence Project. And this fact is one that has become central to Smollett as he continues to navigate the incident within the public eye, which is why he agreed to an interview with the morning show.

""I think people need to hear the truth,"" he said. “'Cause everybody has their own idea. Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community — young black children — to know how strong that they are.""

5am – D President Trump installed his own $50,000 golf simulator in the White House. (Golf Digest) – President Trump gets his share of golf in, making over 150 trips to his courses since taking office in 2017. But those visits are mostly confined to the weekends, and the Washington, D.C. weather is not conducive to working on one’s game in the winter. So Trump did what any hacker with means would do: he installed his own simulator in the White House. According to the Washington Post, Trump recently put in a $50,000 Trackman golf simulator in his personal quarters. A White House official told the Post Trump paid for the simulator out of his own pocket. The Post’s story coincides with an Axios report around Trump’s “Executive Time,” which accounts for 60 percent of his scheduled hours. Axios said that Trump usually did not leave his residence for the Oval Office until about 11 a.m. Now, before you go connecting the dots, a White House official said Trump has not used the simulator since it was installed. Which, hey, we get running the world is a time-consuming job, but you’re going to install a freakin’ simulator and not use it? Talk about government waste, amirite? Following the report, Trump tweeted, “When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing.” Which is what every golfer has told their significant others after spending hours grinding away on the driving range. Virtual or otherwise.

5am – E TRUMP VS COONS

POLITICO: ‘He was in his face’: Trump fumes over abortion, courts evangelicals. The night before last week’s National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump was hosting religious leaders and lawmakers for dinner at the White House when he spotted Democratic Senator Chris Coons — and pounced. Trump confronted the Delaware lawmaker — who attended the event as the Prayer Breakfast’s official Democratic co-chair — over the issue of abortion, creating a tense scene in the White House’s Blue Room, according to three sources familiar with the exchange. Trump leaned in close to Coons, who calls himself “a practicing Christian and a devout Presbyterian,” and laced into the Democratic senator over controversial moves to change statewide policies on abortion that have roiled New York and Virginia politics in recent weeks. “He was in his face about it,” said one person familiar with the exchange. The person described Trump as extremely “worked up.” “He saw a Democrat in the room, a Democrat who’s known to be a person of faith, and he was like, ‘Why aren’t you speaking out about this?’” the source added. Another source who was in the room confirmed the account, describing the moment as both “awkward” and attention-grabbing. Rarely has Trump been so vocal about abortion when the masses aren’t watching, this person said. (A Coons spokesman declined to comment.) The private episode underscored Trump’s recent public focus on abortion, which has delighted his evangelical Christian supporters. During his State of the Union address last Tuesday, Trump used vivid imagery to claim that New York’s new abortion law would “allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth.” And he accused Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, who’s backed similar legislation in his state, of wanting to allow medical providers to “execute” babies after birth.

6am – A/B/C Have four or more babies in Hungary and you’ll pay no income tax for life, prime minister says. Hungary wants to promote family support schemes. Prime Minister Viktor Orban has unveiled measures to boost the birth rate. The nationalist government is anti-immigration and has fallen out with the EU over migrant quotas. (CNBC) — Hungary’s prime minister has announced a raft of measures aimed at boosting the country’s declining birth rate and reducing immigration. Giving his annual State of the Nation address Sunday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced a seven-point “Family Protection Action Plan” designed to promote marriage and families. Measures announced included waivers on personal income tax for women raising at least four children for the rest of their lives and subsidies for large families to buy larger cars. The ‘action plan’ also extended a loan program to help families with at least two children to buy homes. Every woman under 40 will also be eligible for a preferential loan when she first gets married. The government has also said it will spend more on Hungary’s heathcare system and will create 21,000 creche places. In addition, grandparents will be eligible to receive a childcare fee if they look after young children instead of the parents, Orban said. “There are fewer and fewer children born in Europe. For the West, the answer (to that challenge) is immigration. For every missing child there should be one coming in and then the numbers will be fine,” Orban said, Reuters reported. “But we do not need numbers. We need Hungarian children,” he said, announcing the incentives program. Referring to the action plan, Orban said “this is Hungary’s answer (to challenges) rather than immigration,” he said, according to English-speaking news service Daily News Hungary. Orban is a well-known critic of immigration and Hungary’s government caused controversy in the European Union, of which Hungary is a member, when it (along with its eastern European neighbors) refused to allow asylum seekers to enter the country during the migration crisis in the continent in 2015.

6am – D “Empire” star Jussie Smollett says he’s “pissed” people don’t believe his account of attack (Variety) — In his first interview since he was attacked on Jan. 29, Jussie Smollett sat with ABC News’ Robin Roberts to share his feelings about the incident and address the rumors that he might not be telling the truth about the attack, which is being investigated as a possible hate crime. The full segment will air Thursday morning on “Good Morning America.” “I’m pissed off,” the actor told Roberts. “It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it,’ ’cause it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth,’” he said. “And then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.” Smollett, 36, plays a gay man on the Fox series “Empire,” and came out as gay himself in 2015. The police report details that the attackers approached him at 2 a.m., made homophobic slurs against him and hit him in the face with their hands. The attackers have yet to be identified. According to the report, “The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black. The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled.”

6am – E GREEN NEW DEAL ISN’T GOING WELL IN DC: Next to Rock Creek Park, neighborhood resistance to District’s rain gardens on city streets. In a verdant Northwest neighborhood named after its woods, residents are vowing to resist the city’s efforts to add more greenage with over two dozen rain gardens on local streets. As part of the District’s plan to clean waterways of pollution, engineers are installing “green infrastructure” able to capture stormwater throughout the city. The objective is simple: Collect rainwater at the source before it sloshes down asphalt roads, gathering toxins and eventually depositing the polluted mix into the Potomac and Anacostia rivers. One environmental trouble spot is in Barnaby Woods, a northern section of DC’s Chevy Chase neighborhood adjacent to Rock Creek Park. Rainwater there flows down the neighborhood’s steep ridges and deposits into the creek, bringing along contaminants. For more than two years, the DC Department of Transportation has worked on a project to build 29 gardens in this area to collect stormwater before it has a chance to pollute the creek. But opposition is strong in the neighborhood, where many residents believe these curb-out gardens would be too densely packed and create various traffic, parking and quality-of-life problems. Nineteen blocks would receive at least one garden, with some intersections getting three or four nearby. “In a residential neighborhood, in fact adjacent to woods, where we have wildlife and plenty of yard and bushes and trees, this is not welcomed,” said Carolyn Cook, a resident and former advisory neighborhood commissioner. “In fact, it doesn’t beautify our neighborhood at all.”

6am – F 1,159-page bipartisan border compromise completed, Dems worry Trump blow up (Fox News) — Congressional bargainers late Wednesday completed a 1,159-page border security compromise that gives President Trump less than a quarter of the $5.7 billion he wanted to build a wall with Mexico. Democrats say they are confident about having the votes to pass the bill — but not everyone is at ease. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said there is still “worry” that Trump could try to blow up the deal at the last minute because “we have seen that before.” With Trump’s halfhearted signature widely expected but hardly guaranteed, congressional leaders planned votes Thursday on the sweeping package. Summaries of the legislation say that besides nearly $1.4 billion to build new barriers, there’s over $1 billion for other border security programs. That includes money for inspection equipment for border ports of entry. There is more than $400 million in humanitarian aid for detained migrants plus funds to buy aircraft and to hire 600 more customs officers and additional immigration judges. Democrats say they are confident about having the votes to pass the bill — but not everyone is at ease. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said there is still “worry” that Trump could try to blow up the deal at the last minute because “we have seen that before.” Congressional negotiators announced Monday that they’d reached “an agreement in principle” on border security funding that includes more than $1.3 billion for physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. The White House initially requested $5.7 billion for the border wall.

7am – B Esquire Ripped for ‘American Boy’ Profile. The cover story profiles a high school senior from Wisconsin and his experiences growing up “in the era of social media, school shooting, toxic masculinity, #MeToo, and a divided country.” Many on social media mocked the piece and magazine, lambasting the fact that it was published during Black History Month.

7am – C Northam postpones Black History Month reception amid fallout. RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration has postponed a reception to celebrate Black History Month as the governor continues to deal with the fallout from a racist yearbook photo. Northam spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said the reception has been moved from Wednesday to later this month. She said the administration is thinking through better ways to honor Black History Month. Black leaders said Monday that they would stage a large protest outside the reception. Northam has ignored calls to resign. A photo of a man in blackface standing next to someone in Ku Klux Klan robes surfaced in his 1984 medical school yearbook. He denies he’s in the photo, but admitted to wearing blackface in 1984. Virginia Legislative Black Caucus Chairman Del. Lamont Bagby says it would be “poor timing” to have the reception now.

7am – D/E INTERVIEW – HENRY RODGERS – Daily Caller News Foundation’s Capitol Hill reporter

Menendez threatens to call police on reporter asking about Green New Deal: report. (Fox News) – U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., had a fiery exchange with a reporter on Capitol Hill on Wednesday when asked to comment on the Green New Deal. Henry Rodgers, the Daily Caller’s Capitol Hill reporter, approached the senator at a subway station and asked him if he supported Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s legislative proposal. Menendez avoided the question and asked where Rodgers worked. Rodgers said that when he told Menendez he worked for the Daily Caller, the Democrat responded by saying he would not answer any questions. An intern who was with Rodgers asked a follow-up question, and tensions apparently rose. The reporter followed the tweet with an audio clip from their back-and-forth. “I am wondering why you won’t answer questions on the Green New Deal?” Rodgers asked. “I won’t answer questions to the Daily Caller, period! You’re trash,” Menendez responded. “Why do you think we’re trash, sir?” the reporter followed. “Don’t keep harassing me anymore or I’ll race to the Capitol Police,” the New Jersey Democrat threatened. Rodgers told Fox News he had no prior interaction with Menendez and was working on a story that was to include the responses of Senate Democrats regarding the Green New Deal.

Ocasio-Cortez Living in Luxury Navy Yard Apartment Building. (Washington Free Beacon) — After fretting about whether she’d be able to afford rent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) has moved into a luxury apartment building in the District of Columbia’s Navy Yard neighborhood, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, got a big raise with her election to Congress, a job that comes with a $174,000 annual salary. She told the New York Times she was concerned about how she would get an apartment before that salary kicked in. She ended up moving into a luxury apartment building with a wide array of amenities where rent for even a studio apartment exceeds $2,000 a month. The Washington Free Beacon is not disclosing the exact building Ocasio-Cortez lives in due to safety concerns expressed by her office.



8am – A INTERVIEW — SENATOR JONI ERNST – junior United States Senator for Iowa since 2015 – discussed her meeting with Ivanka Trump yesterday and her efforts to push for paid family leave.

Ernst and GOP paid leave backers claim pro-woman, pro-family mantle with bill rollout. (Washington Examiner) — Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, says she is ready to speak out more on issues of particular relevance to women, starting with the lack of paid parental leave in the U.S. Ernst, who is now the fourth-highest ranking Republican in the Senate, is working alongside a group of male GOP counterparts to write conservative legislation that would let new parents take paid time off from work after the birth or an adoption of a child. “We have shared the same concerns about issues for years and years and years, we just maybe aren’t as vocal about those issues,” Ernst said of Republicans, speaking in the first interview in her new office. “Most of the conservative women I work with, they’re very modest. They don’t want to be out at the forefront. Some of those issues are very hard to talk about. I think now is the time. If we need to speak up, we need to speak up. We’ll find our way forward with our new voice.” Democrats long have claimed paid family leave as their cause, but that has been changing — with the blessing of the Trump White House. Part of the reason for the shift is that Republicans believe they’ve found a conservative approach to paid family leave by letting new parents draw from Social Security early in exchange for delaying retirement. It’s still a new development. Ernst described the effort as being in its “infancy stages” and said she didn’t yet have specific commitments from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. She stressed, however, that Republicans were gaining traction with the idea by presenting it as a boon to small businesses and to families who need time to bond with their infants.

8am – B Valentine’s Day gifts: How much men really plan to spend. (Fox Business) — It’s been dubbed one of the most romantic days of the year, but depending on what stage your romantic relationship is at, Valentine’s Day Opens a New Window. could end up being a real doozy — especially if you’re married. According to a new study by Lendingtree.com, while most men polled on average said they plan to spend $95 on the holiday, that price point dropped to $57 for married couples. However, that average gained a big boost when polling engaged couples — they plan to spend an average of $92 with a slight decrease for couples who are dating, at $88. The biggest overall spending gap was seen between the genders. Men said they expect to spend an average of $95, while women said they plan to dish out less than half that amount, averaging $41. LendingTree also found that “overspending” for Valentine’s Day to be much riskier than underspending. Only 4 percent of all respondents polled — both men and women — said they would be disappointed if their partners spent less than they expected, while one in four said they would be irritated if their partner spends too much. More than one in three don’t expect their partners to spend a single cent this year on the holiday, while more than one in three admitted they really didn’t have any plans to either. Generation Z plans to spend the most this year — $113 — while millennials are averaging $49. A third of baby boomers polled said they would be upset if their partners spent a lot of money on them.

8am – C ‘50 Shades of Maple Glen.’ Neighbors hot, bothered over sale of home with ‘sex oasis’ (Kansas City) — It is apparently safe to assume that the neighbors who live near the stately brick Colonial at 1612 Norristown Road in suburban Philadelphia were never invited over for dinner. Or if they were, they didn’t go down to the basement. Because they are in a lather now over how real state agent Melissa Leonard is selling the home, which from the outside looks a lot like Macaulay Culkin’s “Home Alone” house. Leonard has nicknamed it “50 Shades of Maple Glen” because of the “sex oasis” in the basement – and as a wink to the “50 Shades of Grey” book/movie series depicting the sweaty, erotic underbelly of physical attraction. The whips and chains come with the house. “It’s a beautiful house in a great neighborhood, a great school district,” Leonard said, according to Slate magazine. The home’s listing on the Coldwell Banker website refers to it as a “one of a kind suburban home.” The asking price: $750,000. “Private quiet lane of 3 homes leads you to a secluded 4 bedrooms upstairs plus 1 bedroom in basement 2.5 bath colonial home located just 15 miles outside Philadelphia in the suburb of Maple Glen,” the listing reads. The house has three fireplaces, hardwood floors, a newly updated gourmet kitchen and a big deck, according to the listing. “In addition to the home gym, the basement has been outfitted so that you and your (partner/spouse/guest/friend) can enjoy a fun and exciting evening of BDSM play,” writes Philadelphia magazine. “You’ll find all the furniture and equipment you need to tie up your intended and have your way: stocks in the four-poster bed, a rack, whips, chains, the whole nine yards.” “The owner currently rents it out on Airbnb for $750 a night during the week and $2000 a night on weekends,” Leonard said, Philadelphia magazine reported. “He just started this and has made $5,000 in his first month. He’s getting constant bookings, and he even was hired to film a rap video there.” KYW Newsradio in Philadelphia reported that some real estate websites removed photos of the sexy basement when they listed the house, “which bothered Leonard.” “I am very comfortable with it, talking about it, showing it,” she said, according to the Philadelphia radio station. “It’s portraying the realness of the house. I don’t want to lie and say it’s not there, that’s why I left (the listing) the way it was.” Since the listing went public – and quickly viral – Leonard has been tied up by reporters, lookie-loos and steamed neighbors.

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett disputed the narrative that his alleged January attackers wore Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats in an interview with “Good Morning America” Thursday.

“I never said that!” Smollett said.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” Smollett said. “They called me a [bleep]. They called me a [bleep]. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

HERE’S WHAT YOU’RE MISSING …

Smollett has claimed two men beat him up, tied a rope around his neck, said racial and homophobic slurs and threw an unidentified chemical substance on him on Jan. 29, according to The Associated Press.

Several media sources reported on the alleged attackers wearing MAGA hats.

He claimed in a follow-up interview with the Chicago Police Department that the men said, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett also challenged another narrative that the attack was the result of a date gone wrong.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I so resent that narrative,” Smollett said. “I’m not going to go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive. Yes, there’s Grinder, yes, there’s Jack’d, yes there’s all of these things which I have not been on in years. I can admit that I was on it back in the day. I was single. You know what I’m saying? But I haven’t been on that in years.”

HERE’S WHAT YOU’RE MISSING …

Smollett initially refused to hand over phone records, but then gave police a “heavily redacted” version of the logs.

That’s become standard practice on the Left since Donald Trump became president. Once hailed and honored by minorities as one of their biggest supporters and allies, the Donkey Party and its supporters now equate him with the founders of the KKK (all of whom were, ironically, Democrats).

But not all allegations of racism are legitimate, of course, and in fact, some are flat-out fabrications, used by Leftists to gain political advantages, engender sympathy, feed into the (false) narrative that “Trumpsters” are all bigots or a combination of all three.

Case in point, perhaps: “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.

A few weeks ago, he claimed he was beaten up in the wee hours of a frigid morning in Chicago as he ventured out around 2 a.m. for a Subway sandwich. At the time, he told police that two hooded men worked him over, at once shouting racial and homophobic slurs (Smollett is gay), pouring a liquid believed to be bleach on him, and informing him in a loud and deliberate manner that “This is MAGA country.”

Instant hate crime, with a side order of Trump the Bigot. Naturally, the anti-POTUS automatons in Hollywood chimed right in, blasting all of the president’s supporters as covert Klansmen (Klanspeople?) and virtue-signaling their support for Smollett.

But in the days that followed the alleged attack, strange things began to happen. Smollett’s claims were not bearing out. Witnesses didn’t materialize. Friends began to doubt his version of events. And police could find no real suspects and no video of the alleged whupping, though Smollett was traveling in a video-heavy part of the city.

Not only were police in Chicago — who quickly declared what happened a “hate crime” — not getting any cooperation from the actor. Neither was the FBI. (Related: Media utterly humiliated again by ‘MAGA’ hate hoaxes – Trump derangement syndrome has destroyed the Liberal media complex.)

A few days after the alleged attack, Smollett even read a prepared statement before a performance at Chicago’s Troubadour Theater, in which he ‘walked back’ previous claims, namely, he didn’t have any broken ribs and he never actually went to the hospital.

This is looking more and more like a hate crime hoax

Chicago PD did find video of the actor, however, but not of the attack: They say security footage showed him returning to his apartment still holding his just-purchased Subway sandwich, Grabien News reported. Many observers found that to be a bit surprising given his horrific ordeal (alleged).

Initially, and for two weeks afterward, Smollett refused to turn his cell phone over to cops so they could verify parts of his story — namely, that he was talking to his manager at the time he was attacked. He finally did turn over a downloaded .pdf version of ‘phone data,’ which was “heavily redacted” according to police, and thus, worthless. So police are asking for more records.

In addition, The New York Post reports that neighbors aren’t buying into the actor’s story, either.

“I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did,” Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same pricey high-rise near the Navy Pier as Smollett, told the Post.

“I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.”

One customer at Lizzie McNeill’s Irish Pub, located about a block from the alleged attack, told the Post Smollett’s story “doesn’t really make sense.”

“It’s a lie because Chicago is the most liberal city around,” the man — who didn’t give his name — said. “They have cameras everywhere… Why can’t they find the attack?”

Chicago PD said several days ago that if it was discovered that Smollett filed a fake hate crime report he would be charged accordingly.

That time may have arrived.

According to Mediaite, investigators reportedly agree that his story is suspicious and members of the media are also side-eyeing his account of the event.

The report suggests that cops may be hesitant to publicly question Jussie’s version of events because they fear the backlash that will erupt for targeting a gay, liberal Black male.

“The first thing you need to understand about this situation is that, because of Smollett’s persona and the nature of his allegation, no one in law enforcement or the news media wants any part of publicly questioning his story. Everyone knows that if they make any sort of negative implication against a black, gay, liberal, celebrity, victim of a horrible hate crime, that they will be roundly and severely attacked, regardless of whether they turn out to be correct.”

Police are reportedly still searching for the two masked assailants who doused Jussie with bleach and tied a noose around his neck. He reportedly transported himself to a local hospital after the attack and was released hours later in “good condition.”

“It is very obvious that if one major news outlet in Chicago had the guts to be the first to openly discredit Smollett’s story, the others would soon follow the leader. But because the risk of being wrong in this situation…, there is just no incentive to take that dive until and unless the police finally make a definitive statement,” Mediate writes.

Smollett’s spokesperson told The Post that he “is the victim here” and “Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” the statement read.

“Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

In the days following the attack, Smollett released a statement saying, “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.”"

“Through a meticulous investigation, #ChicagoPolice detectives have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member. These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned. Investigation continues,” Anthony Guglielmi, the chief spokesperson for the Chicago PD, said on Twitter.

He continued: “Important for media reporting: The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported. They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.”

Smollett has said the attack took place on Jan. 29 at 2 a.m., after the actor says that two men jumped him, yelling racial epithets while placing a rope around his neck. A police statement said unspecified chemicals were poured on the star’s face, and a rope placed around his neck.

As of Thursday morning, Chicago police have not made any arrests in the case and have issued statements seeking access to Smollett’s cellphone since he said he was on a call with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, during the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records, but Guglielmi said in a statement at that time, “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

In an interview on “Good Morning America” Thursday morning, Smollett addressed why he was initially reluctant to hand over the records, saying he did not want his private information in the hands of the police.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that,” he said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

Guglielmi said earlier on Twitter that “the people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported. They are not considered suspects at this time.”

The men are Nigerian brothers and were questioned by police after flying into O’Hare airport from Nigeria on Wednesday evening, Guglielmi said.

Police said they searched the men’s apartment two nights ago.

A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said that Uber and Yellow Cab were helpful in tracking the men’s whereabouts on the night of the attack.

Smollett, one of the stars of “Empire,” told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who yelled “racial and homophobic slurs.” Smollett alleged that one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him before running away.

Police previously released surveillance images of two people they said were wanted for questioning.

Smollett gave his first detailed account of the attack in an interview that aired Thursday morning on “Good Morning America,” saying he was “forever changed” by it.

“I don’t subscribe to the idea everything happens for a reason,” he told ABC’s Robin Roberts, “but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and the responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

The 36-year-old said he was on the phone with his manager and crossing an intersection when he heard someone say, “Empire!”

When he didn’t respond — “My name ain’t ‘Empire,'” Smollett said — he said he heard someone yell a racial slur.

“So I turned around and said ‘What the f**k did you just say to me’ and I see the attacker masked,” Smollett said, appearing to get emotional. “He said ‘This MAGA country n****r’ and he punched me in the face so I punched his a** back.”

The attackers soon ran off, and Smollett told Moore that he had been jumped.

Smollett told Roberts he had seen the images released by police and said, “For me, I don’t have any doubt in my mind that’s them.”

He also rejected reports that said he told police the attackers were wearing Make America Great Again hats.

“I never said that,” he said. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he assumes he was attacked because of his criticism of President Donald Trump, telling Roberts, “I come really hard against 45.”"

Smollett originally did not give the authorities his phone, but recently done so. However, detectives have rejected the records Smollett submitted via PDF because they were so heavily edited.

A police spokesperson stated that Smollett was not being accused of changing his phone records, admitting that the actor was being cooperative with the investigation and is still being treated as the victim of a hate crime.

While host Robin Roberts did ask the actor about the controversial aspects of his story on Good Morning America, she did not refer to the attack as “alleged” even once. Instead, she asked him to teach us all what we could “learn” from the alleged experience.

During the first clips of the full upcoming Nightline interview GMA previewed, Roberts focused on Smollett’s story, asking him to share again what happened.The actor clearly seemed to struggle with his answers in just relaying his story. His demeanor changed dramatically in the second half of the interview, after Roberts started treating him as if he were a martyr, with fawning questions like:

What do you say to a young gay man, a young gay person? ... If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal? ... It's been two weeks since that night left actor Jussie Smollett bruised but not broken. And he's still processing the raw emotions. Have you ever been threatened before?

Repeatedly, Roberts came to Smollett’s defense, at one point, telling her fellow anchors that his story was “credible:”

That's the first time he's given a detailed account, an account that Chicago police have saids that been consistent. He hasn't changed his story and they also said it's credible. The police have said that and also that he's been very cooperative.

She even assisted Smollett in his story at another point:

In fact, the week before the attack police confirm a letter was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago with threatening language and laced with powdery substance likely Tylenol. Do you think there's a link between the letter and the attack? You did mention it to the police right away about the letter.

Smollett became angry repeatedly during the interview at the notion that he “made up” the story, which has raised much skepticism for its dubious claims that two Trump supporting white guys were walking the streets of downtown Chicago in the middle of the night and recognized the liberal television actor. Roberts didn’t acknowledge that aspect of his story as being unbelievable. She only offered two question skeptically, asking why he went to Subway at 2 AM in subzero temperatures and why he didn't hand over his phone immediately.

The actor bashed his critics as “not wanting to know the truth,” even demanding his story be unchallenged as it stands. “I want them to stop being able to say, ‘alleged attack,'"" he gushed. Well with Roberts at least, he got his wish. Not once in the interview shown did she call the attack, “alleged.” She instead referred to the alleged incident as, “that night” and “his story.”"

Chicago police say they have identified two ""persons of interest"" in the assault case involving Jussie Smollett, just hours after ABC's ""Good Morning America"" aired an interview with the ""Empire"" actor in which he described his alleged attack.

""After a meticulous investigation with the use of advance technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records, detectives have identified two persons of interest in the Empire cast member case. No further information available at this time,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. In a tweet Thursday, Guglielmi said that the individuals that were seen on surveillance tape images released last month ""are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned.""

In the interview that aired Thursday morning, Smollett told Robin Roberts he is ""pissed off"" following the attack, which Chicago police are investigating as a potential hate crime.

The interview marked Smollett's first detailed public account of the attack, which police say happened in Chicago around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. Police say Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was assaulted by two ""unknown offenders"" who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on the actor and wrapped a rope around his neck.

Chicago police have not made any arrests and have not found any video of the alleged assault, leading some people to doubt Smollett's account of what happened. Smollett, who wiped away tears throughout the interview, told Roberts he is angry about the assault, but also about people not believing his story.

""At first, it was like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth,"" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that, like how do you not believe that. It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

Smollett told Roberts that before the alleged attack, he had gone to a Subway restaurant shortly after landing in Chicago, where the Fox drama had been filming.

He was on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, as he left the restaurant. As he crossed the street, Smollett said he heard someone yell ""Empire,"" which he ignored. It was after hearing homophobic and racial slurs that he turned around and confronted a man in a ski mask.

Smollett said the attacker told him ""this is MAGA country"" and used a racial slur before punching him in the face. ""So I punched his a -- right back.""

""We started tussling,"" Smollett said. A second attacker began kicking him in the back. ""Then it just stopped and they ran off. ""

Smollett said his manager was still on the phone, which had fallen out of his pocket. He told Moore he had just been jumped. Then, Smollett said, he looked down and saw a rope.

""I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming,"" Smollett said. ""And I said 'there's a (expletive) rope around my neck.""

Police previously told The Post that a thin, white rope was still around Smollett's neck when they first came into contact with him about 40 minutes after the attack. He told Roberts he was only able to give a body description of his attackers because the entire encounter happened so fast. ""It felt like minutes, but it was probably like 30 seconds, honestly,"" Smollett said.

The actor said he doesn't ""have any doubt"" that the two people in the surveillance image released by police are his alleged attackers.

""I want that video found so badly"" -- for multiple reasons, Smollett told Roberts. ""No, 1, I want them to find the people that did it, No. 2, I want them to stop being able to say 'alleged attack.'

""I want them to see that I fought back,"" Smollett continued, his voice breaking. ""And I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f--- back.""

""I didn't run off. They did,"" Smollett said, referring to his attackers.

Smollett has faced increased scrutiny this week amid reports that he gave redacted phone records to police. A spokeswoman for the Chicago Police Department confirmed to The Post that they ""received limited and redacted phone records from the victim.""

The spokeswoman said the records will be analyzed by detectives, who will follow up with Smollett if additional information is needed. She added that Moore, who police consider a key witness because he said he could hear the attackers over the phone, ""has refused to let police examine his phone.""

Smollett's publicist released a statement this week noting that ""any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack."" The statement emphasized that Smollett is a victim and that he has cooperated with police throughout the investigation.

""Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible,"" Smollett's publicist said in the statement.

Earlier this month, Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson told Chicago's ABC 7 that Smollett had ""been very cooperative and we have no reason, at this point, to think that he's not being genuine with us.""

""I have fought for love. I'm an advocate. I respect too much the people -- who I am now one of those people -- who have been attacked in any way,"" Smollett said during his ""GMA"" interview. ""You do such a disservice when you lie about something like this.""

""If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal?"" Roberts asked the actor.

""I don't know,"" Smollett said, as his eyes filled with tears."" Let's just hope that they are. Let's not go there yet.""

""I understand how difficult it will be to find them, but we gotta,"" he added. ""I still want to believe with every thing that has happened that there's something called justice.""

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has hit back at “lies” spread online after he was attacked in Chicago last month.

Appearing on Good Morning America on Wednesday (February 14), Smollett spoke out about the misinformation that has circulated since he was assaulted in the early hours of January 29, telling the programme: “I’m p***ed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks.”

Smollett was reportedly branded a “faggot Empire n****r” and had a noose tied around his neck by two men who shouted the pro-Trump acronym “MAGA,” which stands for “Make America Great Again.” Police have released CCTV stills of two people they are seeking to speak to in connection with the attack.

However, right-wing conspiracy theorists have attempted to discredit Smollett’s version of events, even accusing him of fabricating details incriminating Trump supporters.

Jussie Smollett conspiracy theory tweets ‘liked’ by Donald Trump Jr.

Several theories reached the the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., who liked a tweet that reads: “I’m more inclined to believe that Hillary Clinton is the President of the United States, than the story that Jussie Smollett was attacked by Trump supporters.”

Another post liked by Trump Jr. reads: “If you believe [Jussie Smollett’s account] (…) you’re part of the problem.”

Jussie Smollett responds to claims he ‘made up’ the attack

In the interview with Good Morning America‘s Robin Roberts, Smollett said he was “p***ed off.”

Addressing the criticism, the actor added: “At first it was, if I tell the truth, then that’s it, because it’s the truth. Then it became, how can you not believe that, it’s the truth. Then it became, oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, but you don’t even want to see the truth.”

Smollett added: “I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more.

“That says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

The Chicago Police Department has made clear that Smollett has fully cooperated with officers, and that his account of events has been consistent.

Smollett continued: “For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a faggot, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Jussie Smollett explains why he didn’t want to give his phone to police

Smollett also explained why he had declined to hand over his phone to police, a detail that has been seized upon by conspiracy theorists.

He said: “They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but I’m not gonna do that, because I have private pictures and videos and numbers.

“My partner’s number, my family’s number, my cast mates’ numbers, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.

“I don’t know what that’s gonna be, to hand over my phone for — and honestly, by then, inaccurate, false statements had already been put out there.”

Smollett said he believes the two men in the CCTV stills released by police are the men who attacked him.

He said: “For me, when that was released, I was like, OK, we’re getting somewhere. I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. I never did.”"

The actor talked with Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts and the interview aired Thursday morning. A tearful Smollett recounted the incident he says happened two weeks ago, and he is standing by what he says happened, despite those who have voiced doubts.

He Wanted To Clarify Inaccuracies That Have Been Detailed

During the Good Morning America interview, Smollett worked on correcting mistakes in the reporting of what happened that night. Some reports said that the alleged attackers were wearing supposedly Trump-related “MAGA” hats.

However, Jussie says that he never said that was the case. The Empire star says that the attackers called him a “f***ot” and “n*gger,” so he doesn’t need a MAGA hat as a “cherry on top of a racist sundae” to prove what their viewpoints were.

In addition, Smollett says that some reports of the injuries he received were inaccurate. While Jussie did have some bruised ribs and a sore clavicle, he did not have cracked ribs as some reported.

He Believed Video Would Support His Narrative Of The Attack

Another key takeaway from the segment was when the Empire actor said he walked police through the attack that night. Smollett took them down to the street to walk through the incident, and Jussie was relieved when he looked up and saw a camera affixed to a light post that was right at the intersection in question.

""I want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children to know how strong they are."" @JussieSmollett thinks people need to hear ""the truth"" after his attack. https://t.co/b5efiP0JCG pic.twitter.com/YGVIDMipgC — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 14, 2019

Unfortunately, Jussie explained, the police soon told him that the camera had been facing north, away from where Smollett said the attack played out. The Empire star says he was incredibly disappointed to learn that, but he feels sure that there must be video footage somewhere of the attack.

He Wants People To Know The Truth & That He Fought

When asked what Smollett thinks people need to hear from this, he said that he wants people to understand the truth. Jussie said that, in particular, he wants young people, members of the LGBTQ community, and black children to know how strong they are.

Smollett also talked about how he fought back against the attackers, and he thinks it’s important people know that. Jussie says that the attackers ran away, not him, and he hopes that this helps rewrite the narrative about that night.

He Says He’s Permanently Changed Now

A tearful Jussie explained that he is forever changed by this incident, and he’ll never again be the same man he was before that night. Despite the hurt he endured, Smollett says that people have a responsibility and a right to create something meaningful out of what they experience, both the good things and the bad things.

Jussie noted that he respects others who have been attacked in any way, and he believes people do a disservice to other victims when they lie. Throughout the interview, the Empire actor maintained that what he reported was accurate and wiped away tears throughout the segment.

He Is Unsure How He Will Heal If There’s No Closure

Smollett noted that he’s not sure how he’ll heal if the people who attacked him are never caught. The investigation into the actor’s alleged attack continues, and new information about people of interest has recently been revealed.

Will Jussie Smollett be vindicated when the investigation is finished, given all of the doubt that’s been voiced about what happened? The Empire actor’s interview was an emotional one that definitely will surely have an impact on those who watch it."

ABC(NEW YORK) — Jussie Smollett spoke directly to his “doubters” in an exclusive interview with Robin Roberts that aired on Good Morning America Thursday, just over two weeks after the Empire star told police he was attacked in what authorities are investigating as a suspected hate crime.

In his first interview since he told police he was attacked last month, the singer and actor said he was “heartbroken” when he found out that people questioned the details of his story.

Smollett said the attack happened on Jan. 29, at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant in Chicago. He said the attackers put a noose around his neck and poured an unknown substance, likely bleach, on him. Then he claims they used their hands, feet and teeth as weapons in the assault, according to the incident report, which ABC News obtained last week via a Freedom of Information Act request.

Smollett claimed the attackers also yelled, “This is MAGA country,” during the attack — a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan.

To Roberts, he denied early claims about the incident: no, the alleged attackers were not wearing Make America Great Again hats and no, he did not have cracked ribs.

He addressed the doubters by saying, “…it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me …A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

He added, “It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.”

Others suggested that he may have lied in his explanation for being outside at 2 a.m. in sub-zero Chicago weather, but Smollett said “that’s ridiculous.”

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent…” he said.

Smollett also confirmed reports that he was initially reluctant to contact the police or handover his cellphone to help with the investigation, the latter of which could have proved or disproved the “MAGA Country” claims.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that,” he said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmates’ number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

He also revealed that he didn’t want to call the police at first, but his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, did so on his behalf. When police arrived, responding officers said they found Smollett in his apartment with stained clothing and a “white rope draped around” his neck, according to the report.

Smollett said he was still in a state of shock and left the rope on because he wanted police to see.

The musician said he believes the two potential persons of interest in a photo released by police in the days after the attack are the perpetrators.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” Smollett said. “Never did.”

Jussie Smollett is opening up about being violently attacked in Chicago in an apparent hate crime last month.

The Empire actor, 36, appeared on Thursday’s Good Morning America for his first in-depth, televised interview since the Jan. 29 incident. After detailing what occurred and hitting back at critics who have questioned the accuracy of his account, Smollett got emotional, confessing his fears that his assailants won’t be found.

The Chicago Police Department has confirmed that Smollett, who is gay, was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery.” They have also released two photos of the persons of interest; however, the images did not show the individuals’ faces.

“I want that [surveillance] video found so badly for four reasons,” Smollett said in the interview. “Number one, I want them to find the people that did it. Number two, I want them to stop being able to say ‘alleged attack.’ Number three, I want them to see that I fought back. And I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought back. It does not take anything away from people who are not able to do that, but I fought back. They ran off, I didn’t.”

“Learn to fight. Learn to be a fighter,” he continued, addressing young gay men. “I am not advocating violence at all, so let’s be clear about that. If you’re going to die, fight until you do. If you don’t fight, you have no chance. I have fought for love. I’m an advocate. I respect too much the people — who I am now, one of those people — who have been attacked in any way.”

After being asked if one can heal if their attackers are never found, Smollett broke down.

“I don’t know. Let’s just hope that they are, you know what I’m saying? Let’s not go there yet,” he said, crying.

“I was talking to a friend and I said, ‘I just want them to find them.’ And she said, ‘Sweetie, they’re not going to find them,’ ” he said. “That just made me so angry. So I’m just going to be left here like this? I’m just going to be left here? They get to go free, go about their life, and possibly attack someone else. And I’m here left with the aftermath? That’s not cool to me. That’s not okay.”

“I understand how difficult it will be to find them but we’ve got to,” he insisted. “I still want to believe, with everything that happened, that there’s something called justice.”

Smollett said the incident changed him forever.

“I will never be the man that this did not happen to,” he said. “And I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason. But I do subscribe to the reason that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

“I think that what people need to hear is just the truth,” he continued. “Everybody has their own idea. Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people — young members of the LGBT community, young black children — to know how strong they are. To know the power that they hold in their little pinky.”

Even before the incident, additional security had been hired for the Empire set after Fox Studios’ Chicago offices allegedly received a threatening homophobic letter addressed to Smollett.

The FBI, who has not responded to PEOPLE’s request for comment, is investigating that alleged letter, a spokesperson for the Chicago Police previously told PEOPLE."

At various points in his sit-down today with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, the Empire actor had to fight back tears as he discussed what happened to him early in the morning of January 29.

""I'm pissed off,"" Smollett told Roberts early in their chat, citing the criticism he's received from doubters of the attack.

Indeed, a bunch of morons out there actually think Smollett isn't telling the truth about what happened to him.

They somehow don't believe what Smollett has told the police -- which is that two masked men taunted him with racial and anti-gay taunts around 2 a.m., screaming that he's in ""MAGA country"" and placing a rope around his neck.

The offenders also battered Smollett with their hands and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

It was a hate crime. It was a modern-day lynching. It was an act of domestic terrorism.

""It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks,"" Smollett continued.

""You know, at first it was a thing of, if I tell the truth, that's it, because it's the truth. Then it became a thing of like, oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that?

""It's the truth. And then it became a thing of, oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

Smollett transported himself to a local hospital after the attack and waited a little bit prior to calling the cops.

For what reason?

""There's a level of pride there,"" he told Roberts.

""We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow, to be weak, and I'm not weak. I am not weak. And we, as a people, are not weak.""

As he recalled the night the incident took place, Smollett said that he fought back after one of the attackers “punched him in the face,” and after some “tussling,” the fighting “just stopped.”

He told Roberts that the assault “felt like minutes but was probably, like, 30 seconds.”

Smollett is African-American, of course, and he came out as gay during an appearance on Ellen in 2015.

“They called me a f—-t, they called me a n–ga. There’s no which way you cut it,” Smollett said.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative. I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Police have released photos of two suspects, via surveillance footage, and Smollett is convinced these were his attackers.

""I do...'cause I was there. For me when that was released, I was like OK, we are getting somewhere. I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. I never did,"" he told Roberts.

Smollett, who insists he's cooperating with authorities, released a lengthy statement to Essence on February 1 to thank fans for “the outpouring of love and support,"" adding:

“These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.

""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.”

In response to Smollett's interview, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis released a statement on Thursday that reads as follows:

Jussie Smollett was victimized first in a hate-motivated and violent attack in Chicago and has since been doubly victimized as the subject of speculation by the media industry and broader culture.

Jussie is rising above hate, racism, homophobia, and doubt surrounding the attack and instead using his voice and talent to fight back against the rising rates of violence against Black and LGBTQ people, as well as those who live at the intersection of those identities.

GLAAD joined with Color of Change to condemn the racism and homophobia that fueled the physical violence against Jussie and today we double down on that stance, while also calling out a culture where LGBTQ people of color are too often the last to be believed.

Jussie's experience is sadly not unique in today's America and we all must lock arms to change that."

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett insisted Thursday that he was targeted by two men shouting racial and gay slurs — and “This is MAGA country” — because of his public comments against President Trump.

“I come really, really hard against 45,” Smollett told ABC’s “Good Morning America”, his first interview since the Jan. 29 incident in Chicago. “I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

Smollett sat down with Robin Roberts to detail for the very first time what happened in the early-morning attack — an incident that has been met with skepticism by some.

The 36-year-old singer-actor, who is openly gay, said he popped into Subway near his apartment to grab a bite after flying back home. He was on the phone with his manager Brandon Moore as he left the sandwich shop and crossed the street.

“I heard ‘Empire,’ and I don’t answer to ‘Empire.’ My name ain’t ‘Empire,’ and I didn’t answer,” Smollett recalled. “I kept walking, and then I heard ‘f—-t, Empire n—r.’ So, I turned around and I said, ‘The f–k did you just say to me?'”

One of the masked men shouted, “This is MAGA country, n—-r!” before punching him in the face.

“So I punched his ass back,” Smollett said. “And then we started tussling and it was very icy. We ended up tussling by the stairs, fighting, fighting, fighting. There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back, and then it just stopped. And they ran off.”

Smollett grabbed his phone and told Moore that he’d just been “jumped” — and that’s when he said he noticed the rope around his neck.

“I started screaming. I said, ‘There’s a f—ing rope around my neck!”

Asked whether he was certain of his attackers’ motive, Smollett said, “I can only go off of their words. I mean, who says, ‘F—t Empire n—r, This is MAGA country, n—r,’ ties a noose around your neck and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight?”

Smollett admitted that he was hesitant to turn over his phone records to police to corroborate his claims. Earlier this week, cops confirmed they received the records but said they were “heavily redacted” and insufficient for a criminal investigation.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but I’m not gonna do that,” the singer said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

Smollett said he was certain the men shown in a grainy photo released by Chicago Police are his attackers.

“I was there. For me, when that was released, I was like OK, we’re getting somewhere,” he said. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

Police are investigating the incident and hunting for the alleged attackers — but Smollett acknowledged they may never be arrested.

“I just want them to find them,” Smollett said he told a friend. “And she said, ‘Sweetie, they’re not going to find them.’ And that just made me so angry. Because I’m just going to be left here with this? I’m going to be left there with — so they get to go free and go about their lives and possibly attack somebody else? And I’m here left with the aftermath of this bull? That’s not OK to me.”

Critics, including Smollett’s own neighbors, say his story doesn’t add up.

Smollett told Roberts that he was “pissed off” by the naysayers.

“You don’t even want to see the truth,” he said."

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” Smollett told ABC News’ Robin Roberts in a sit-down that aired Thursday morning. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

“Yes, there’s Grindr. Yes, there’s jacked. There’s all of these things, which i have not been on in years,” he continued. “I can admit I was on it back in the day. I was single, you know what i’m saying? But i haven’t been on that in years.”

Smollett told police he was attacked January 29 by two masked people who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, also told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance and looped a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck. The actor said that before they ran off, the attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country, ” a reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan President Donald Trump uses.

Smollett and his family have insisted that he has been truthful about the attack and his story has not changed since it happened. “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” the actor said in a statement to ESSENCE magazine. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

His remarks are the latest in a back-and-forth between Smollett and police since he reported the attack. Police have made no arrests and said they have found no surveillance video that shows the attack. They have released video of two people in the area at the time who they said were persons of interest.

However, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Monday that the phone records turned over by Smollett are in a heavily redacted document file and the records from the manager Smollett says he was talking to when the attack occurred were a screenshot of phone calls. He says the records aren’t sufficient for an investigation. “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” Guglielmi said. “Detectives may be following up with him to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.”

In his first interview since his alleged attack on Jan. 29, Empire star Jussie Smollett wanted to address the rumours that he might not be telling the truth about the possible hate crime.

Smollett said he’s “pissed off” on Thursday during his Good Morning America interview with ABC’s Robin Roberts.

“I’m pissed off,” Smollett told Roberts. “It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it,’ ’cause it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth,’” he said.

“It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks,” Smollett said, who’s black and openly gay. “It’s not that you don’t believe this is the truth; you don’t even want to see this is the truth.”

Smollett told authorities that he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two men who were yelling racial and homophobic slurs.”

He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

Smollett told Roberts he landed in Chicago that day, and was picked up by his creative director. Once they got back to his apartment he realized had no food in the house.

He said he left his apartment to go to Walgreens, thinking it was open 24 hours, but ended up at Subway to get a salad.

He said he texted his manager, Brandon Moore, and left a message for Moore to call him.

Smollett said Moore called him back immediately. “While he was on the phone I heard, I was crossing the intersection, I heard ‘Empire!,’ Smollett told Roberts. “I don’t answer to ‘Empire.’ My name ain’t ‘Empire.'”

Smollett said he did not respond and kept walking but then he began to hear someone yell a racial slur. “So I turned around and said ‘What the f**k did you just say to me’ and I see the attacker masked,” Smollett said, appearing to get emotional. “He said ‘This MAGA country n****r’ and he punched me in the face so I punched his a** back.”

His manager was still on the phone and Smollett said he told Moore he had been jumped.

While he was on the phone he said he saw a rope.

“I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming ‘There’s a f***ing rope around my neck,” he said.

He said that he gave a description of his alleged attackers as best as he could.

Smollett said he’s seen the photo that police released of the persons of interest.

He also said that he believes he would have been taken more seriously if his attackers were not Caucasian.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would’ve supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now,” he said.

“I am forever changed. I don’t subscribe to the idea everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and the responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad,” he said.

Smollett went on to explain why he hesitated to report the attack.

“There’s a level of pride there,” Smollett said. “We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I’m not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.”

Smollett refuted some of the information that’s been reported, including that he told police his alleged attackers were wearing MAGA hats.

“I never said that,” he said. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

Smollett told police two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, attacked him and put a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29. The 36-year-old actor is black and openly gay.

Smollett tells ABC News it’s “ridiculous” to think he’d lie in his explanation for being outside at 2 a.m. in frigid Chicago weather.

He says he left the rope and clothes on when police arrived “because I wanted them to see.” He says accusations that the attack was a date gone bad are offensive.

No arrests have been made. Police say they’ve not found surveillance video that shows the attack but that the investigation is ongoing.

According to KABC, Chicago police confirmed Thursday that detectives are talking to two persons of interest in brutal beating.

No arrests have been made at this time.

With tears in his eyes, Smollett sat down with Robin Roberts for his first interview since his assault in Chicago last month.

In the exclusive interview that aired on GMA this morning, the 36-year-old actor got emotional as Roberts asked, “At any point during the attack, did you fear for your life?”

TMZ first broke the news that the popular actor and singer was hospitalized after being attacked by two masked white men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him as they put a noose around his neck and repeatedly punched him.

Smollett shared the graphic details of the racist and homophobic attack with Roberts.

According to Variety, the officers were informed that the actor “did not want to report the offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.”

After the Attack

Shortly after the attack, the Smollett family released their first statement on the assault, exclusively to theGrio.

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

During his first performance after the attack, Smollett took to the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, telling about 400 fans, “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the motherf—ers win.”

Smollett told Roberts that part of what’s been so painful is dealing with the critics who don’t want to believe the details of his assault.

Anthony Guglielmi, spokesman for Chicago Police Department, said earlier Thursday morning that he watched the GMA interview with CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson. Guglielmi said Smollett’s comments on GMA are consistent with what he’s told Chicago police."

Detectives believe the men, both of whom are black, are the same people shown in a surveillance image released by police days after the purported attack, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Detectives were able to trace their location through ride-hailing and taxi records from the area where Smollett said the attack happened, according to a law enforcement source. Police have video from a doorbell camera among other images of the men, who were picked up at O’Hare Airport, the source said.

Officers have searched a North Side home where at least one of the “persons of interest” lives and recovered personal effects including cell phones, a source said. On Thursday night, no one answered the door at the home when a reporter rang the doorbell. The door appeared to have been damaged and left slightly open.

A neighbor said she saw law enforcement officials inside the home Wednesday evening, starting around 8 p.m.

They stayed “well past midnight,” said the neighbor, who asked not to be named. The woman said she would be surprised if her neighbors were involved in the incident involving Smollett.

An attorney for the men, who reportedly just returned from Nigeria, said they do know him.

“They have worked with him on ‘Empire,'” attorney Gloria Schmidt told CBS2. “…They’re baffled why they are people of interest.”

A representative for Smollett said he spoke to detectives about the case on Thursday.

“Jussie today answered routine questions for CPD and continues to be cooperative,” the representative said.

Guglielmi also tweeted Thursday, “Media reports [about] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.”

Smollett: ‘Ridiculous’ that I would lie

Earlier Thursday, Smollett said in an interview on “Good Morning America” that he believed the two people caught on a surveillance camera were his attackers.

An emotional Smollett told GMA anchor Robin Roberts that he’s sick of people questioning his report and hopes police find video showing the attack.

“I want that video found, found badly. Number one: I want them to find the people that did it. Number two: I want them to stop being able to say ‘allegedly.’ Number three: I want them to see I fought back. And I want a little gay boy, who might watch this to see that I fought f—— back.”

Smollett also said he refused to give detectives his phone the night of the attack because of privacy concerns.

“I have private pictures and videos and numbers. My partner’s number, my family’s number, my cast mates’ numbers, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos,” he said.

But Smollett didn’t address why it took him two weeks to give police phone records from that night — or why they were redacted to the point that Chicago police said they were “insufficient for a criminal investigation.”

Roberts, addressing the issue from her anchor chair, said: “His attorneys tell us they are willing to cooperate.”

Smollett said he was on the phone with his manager after leaving a Subway restaurant about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 when he heard someone shout “Empire” as he crossed an intersection in the Streeterville neighborhood.

A gay slur and a racist slur came next, said Smollett, who told police he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street when the attack happened.

“So I turned around and I said ‘What the f— did you just say to me?’”

“And I see the attacker, masked, and he said ‘This MAGA country n—–’ and punches me right in the face, so I punched his ass back. And then we started tussling,” said Smollett.

“You know, it was very icy and we ended up tussling by the stairs — fighting, fighting, fighting — there was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back and then it just stopped and they ran off and I saw where they ran and the phone was in my pocket but it had fallen out and it was sitting there and my manager was still on the phone,” he said.

Attackers weren’t wearing MAGA hats

“So I picked up the phone and was like ‘Brandon’ and he like ‘What’s going on?’ and I said ‘I was just jumped’ and then I looked down and I see that there’s a rope around my neck.”

He said reports that the attackers were wearing MAGA hats are inaccurate. And other false reports have frustrated him, he said.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I so resent that narrative. I’m not going to go out to get a tuna salad sandwich to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous, and it’s offensive,” he said.

“Yes, there’s Grindr. Yes, there’s Jack’d. Yes, there’s all of these things, which I have not been on in years,” Smollett said, referring to gay meet-up apps.

“I’m pissed off,” he said of people doubting his story.

“At first it was a thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth, then that’s it, because it’s the truth.

“Then it became a thing of like ‘Oh, how can you doubt that, like, how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.’ And then it became a thing like ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.’”"

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent? And at different moments...you're seeing the yin and yang of that, the positive and negative of both. Both are just trying to love this child."

The segment includes a blow-by-blow description of Smollett’s recollection of the attack, including one attacker’s declaration of “MAGA country,” his own retaliation after being punched, and the actor’s delayed realization that the assailants had put a rope around his neck. Smollett confirmed that the surveillance images the police obtained of the potential perpetrators squared with his recollection of their appearance.

He also refuted claims that he had told authorities the assailants were wearing Make American Great Again hats. “”I never said that,” he said. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

“I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks,” he began. Later, he responded to those who have expressed doubt about his account of the events. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” he said. “And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

In his first public statement since the attacks earlier this month, Smollett explained that he had been “working with the authories and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.” He continued: “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.” Prior to Smollett’s note, his family released a statement calling the attack an act of “domestic terrorism.”

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Thursday night that local media reports that the attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

The reports surfaced as detectives were questioning two “persons of interest” who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

″(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he told the network. “Never did.”

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing .

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were “ridiculous” to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation .

Van Dyke’s wife now claims he has been assaulted in prison.

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, his wife, Tiffany Van Dyke, said, “We are all petrified and in fear for Jason’s life. Jason just wants to serve his sentence. He does not want any trouble. I hope prison officials will take steps to rectify this right away. He never should have been in the general population.”

The outlet says when Van Dyke was incarcerated in Illinois he was not in general population. However, now that he has been transferred to a Connecticut prison and put in general population, lawyers claim “he had been beaten up by other inmates four hours after arriving at the prison.” He was allegedly attacked in his cell. The Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut wasn’t available for comment on the supposed attack, according to the Associated Press.

Originally, it was believed Van Dyke would receive a minimum of 96 years. However, his 12-year-old daughter wrote a letter to the judge saying, “I have been bullied at school about what has happened. Kids come up to me and say that my dad is a murderer. That hurts so much when people say that to me. My dad is not that.” His wife reportedly pleaded in court by saying, “He has paid the ultimate price. He will no longer be a police officer. His life is over.”

ABC reports, “Judge Vincent Gaughan said he considered the most serious charge to be the second-degree murder charge, not the 16 aggravated battery charges and made his sentencing decision on that murder charge.”

The horrific video of the killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald appeared to show Van Dyke fired at him 16 times within 14 seconds. The video was released one year after McDonald’s death and showed the teen walking away instead of confronting officers, which is what Van Dyke falsely said happened. McDonald continued to be shot at even after he fell to the ground from the initial bullets.

Two police officers and one detective were acquitted of trying to cover up the shooting for Van Dyke, even though that was precisely what they did. The three men all said Van Dyke, who was convicted in October, was justified in shooting the teenager 16 times within 14 seconds. Van Dyke’s partner the night of the shooting, even said: “McDonald was walking toward Van Dyke and with his arms raised when he was shot.” The video would later contradict that account, showing Walsh lied. Still, he and his co-defendants were acquitted.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is reportedly reexamining Van Dyke’s light sentence.

""The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement late Friday.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

But police earlier this week said there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation."

Chicago police said Thursday night that local media reports that the attack against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

The reports surfaced as detectives were questioning two ""persons of interest"" who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren't considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the ""supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea ""patently ridiculous.""

""(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them,"" he told the network. ""Never did.""

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing .

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were ""ridiculous"" to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country,"" referencing President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing ""MAGA"" hats were inaccurate.

""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Smollett said he didn't want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn't remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

He also said he didn't initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation .

“Jussie Smollett was victimized first in a hate-motivated and violent attack in Chicago and has since been doubly victimized as the subject of speculation by the media industry and broader culture,” GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis, said in a statement.

“Jussie is rising above hate, racism, homophobia, and doubt surrounding the attack and instead using his voice and talent to fight back against the rising rates of violence against Black and LGBTQ people, as well as those who live at the intersection of those identities,” she continued.

“GLAAD joined with Color of Change to condemn the racism and homophobia that fueled the physical violence against Jussie and today we double down on that stance, while also calling out a culture where LGBTQ people of color are too often the last to be believed. Jussie’s experience is sadly not unique in today’s America and we all must lock arms to change that.”

On Thursday, Smollett sat for an interview with “Good Morning America’s” Robin Roberts, offering a detailed account of the attack and vigorously pushing back against rumors from online skeptics.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,” he said. “And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

According to Smollett, the attack took place on Jan. 29 at 2 a.m., after two men jumped him, yelled racial epithets and placed a rope around his neck. A police statement said unspecified chemicals were poured on the star’s face, and a rope placed around his neck.

Much has been made of Smollett’s decision not to fully hand over his phone records from the time of the incident. What has been turned over has been limited.

“We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation” Chicago police spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said in an earlier statement.

On “GMA,” Smollett said he was reluctant to hand over his full records because he wanted to keep his personal phone information private.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that,” he said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”"

Speaking with ABC News, the 36-year-old actor said he felt a responsibility to turn publicity around the incident into something “meaningful”.

During a wide-ranging interview broadcast on the American news channel, Smollett cried as he described the attack and its aftermath.

He said: “I will never be the man who this didn’t happen to.

“I am forever changed and I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

Asked what message he wanted to send by speaking about the attack, he replied: “I want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children, to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky.”

Chicago police said on Thursday evening that its detectives had identified the persons of interest in the area of the attack and that they were being questioned, but that they were not being treated as suspects.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance and shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before looping what police said was a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck.

He said he found it insulting that people had implied the attack might have been the result of a “date gone bad”, suggesting such claims were motivated by homophobia.

“I’ve also heard that it was a date gone bad, which I so resent, that narrative. I’m not going to go out and get a tuna sandwich and salad to meet somebody.

Challenged as to why he had not handed his phone to police immediately after the attack, Smollett replied that he had wanted to protect personal details kept on the device.

He said: “They wanted me to give my phone to tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but I’m not going to do that. I have private pictures and videos and numbers, private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.

“By then inaccurate false statements had already been put out there.”

Smollett was also asked about reports, since proven false, that his attackers wore Make America Great Again hats.

He said: “I didn’t need to add anything like that. There’s no way to cut it. You don’t need some Maga hat to be the cherry on top of a racist sundae.”

Police have made no arrests and said they have found no surveillance video that shows the attack.

They released film of two people in the area at the time who they said were persons of interest."

(Eduardo Munoz/Reuters)

The actor Jussie Smollett continues to talk about the alleged January 29 attack on him during a frigid night in Chicago, giving Good Morning America his fullest description yet of his claims. It differs substantially from what he told police initially after the alleged assault.

Smollett told GMA that the alleged attack began with a nasty comment from one person who accosted him on the street. He heard someone yell, “Empire” and then “f****** Empire n*****.” He replied, he now says,“What the f*** did you just say to me?” The man added,“This MAGA country, n*****,” then punched him in the face. He says he fought with the attacker, and as the two “tussled” he became aware that a second assailant was present, kicking his back.

After all of this, the two assailants simply ran away, and a shaken Smollett realized that there was a rope around his neck. Police have said that there is only a 60-second gap in surveillance footage between an image of Smollett with no rope around his neck and an image of him with a rope around his neck. He told GMA both that he was talking to his manager Brandon Moore during the attack and that the phone was in his pocket, but it fell on the ground in the scuffle. After the encounter, Smollett realized that Moore was still on the line. He picked up the phone and shouted at Moore, “There’s a f***ing rope around my neck!” He didn’t call the police to tell them about the attack and the direction in which his attackers had fled.

In previous versions of the story, Smollett a) didn’t mention the MAGA comment (in his first interview with police, 40 minutes later) and b), in a TMZ story based on sources “directly connected to Jussie” said the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country” (no n-word) not at the outset of the attack but as they were leaving. That TMZ story also claimed Smollett had suffered a “fractured” rib. Smollett now says he suffered merely a “bruised” rib.

Obtained by FOIA request, the police report based on an interview with Smollett at 2:42 a.m. on the night of the attack does not align with the story Smollett tells on GMA. In that report both attackers, males dressed in black, one with a black ski mask covering his face, appeared simultaneously and both began with verbal abuse. There was no delay between when Smollett became aware of the first and second attackers. Says the report, “two unknown males approached him and gained his attention by yelling verbatim, ‘Empire [redacted] [redacted],” those words being “racial and homophobic slurs.” Then the attackers proceeded “to batter the victim about the face with their hands and pouring an unknown chemical substance on to him staining his clothing.” There is no mention of being kicked in the back. There is no mention of Smollett fighting back. There is no mention of Smollett saying,“What the f*** did you just say to me?” The report adds,“The victim does not remember any more distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled.”

Yet Smollett told GMA “I saw where they ran.” How does he know this now if he didn’t know it then? He also told the show he offered to police the following distinguishing features: a body description and a description of the eyes and bridge of the nose of the first attacker. These details are unmentioned in the police report. He didn’t get a look at the second attacker.

Disturbing as all of this would be, Smollett left the rope around his neck and calmly walked home. He went to his apartment building, past security, and didn’t tell security personnel about the attack. Forty minutes went by before Moore called police. Why the delay? Smollett says, “We live in a society where as a gay man you are somehow considered to be weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.”

What does weakness have to do with this? A person who is attacked, especially in a hate crime, has a duty to society to report the attack immediately. Did it take Smollett 40 minutes to ponder whether he wants racist and homophobic attackers to be free to roam the streets of Chicago and assault others?

Smollett also told GMA that he was sure the two individuals police called “persons of interest” — nearly unidentifiable shapes who appeared in grainy, low-quality images on nearby surveillance video — were the two people who attacked him. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.” Police have said that the video shows the two individuals walking away from the scene of the alleged attack, 15 to 30 minutes before Smollett says it happened.

Despite the horrific nature of the alleged assault, Smollett seemed to indicate in his GMA interview that he was more hurt by online gossip about his story.

“I’m p***ed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks,” he told Robin Roberts. By “attacks” he seems to mean social-media posts. “At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth….Then it became a thing of, like, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.”

It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now….For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing. I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f*****, they called me a n*****. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.

As for why Smollett refused to turn his phone over to police (he did turn over heavily redacted phone records), he said, “They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that. Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

“I don’t know what that’s gonna be, to hand over my phone for — and honestly, by then, inaccurate, false statements had already been put out there,” he said.

A dozen or so Chicago PD detectives have been working on the case, not to mention the FBI agents investigating a hateful letter sent to Smollett a week before the alleged assault, but it’s possible the matter will simply fizzle out with no definitive truth being established. Police have reportedly been canvassing stores to look for images of the purchase of a white rope such as the one recovered from Smollett."

Speaking with Robin Roberts on an episode of “Good Morning America” that aired today (February 14), Smollett said, “I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks.” He then discussed the attack in vivid detail, describing the racist slurs his attackers used, as well as the fight that ensued and the aftermath.

Following the attack, which occurred on January 29, Jussie Smollet’s family released a statement, calling the incident an “inhumane act of domestic terrorism.”

In his own statement, issued in February, Smollett said, “I still believe that justice will be served.” He continued, “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.

Police have been investigating the attack as a possible hate crime amid an outpouring of support from celebrities and politicians alike. But as often happens with such incidents, doubters have emerged as well, with skeptics questioning elements of Smollett’s account. The actor and advocate addressed all of these questions and more during his emotional, at times tearful interview with G.M.A.’s Robin Roberts.

Early on, Smollett expressed disbelief regarding those who have met his story with skepticism. “At first it was a thing of like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it—’cause it’s the truth!’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth!’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth; you don’t even want to see the truth,’” he said.

Smollett also recounted what happened in his own words, largely reiterating what’s already been reported but adding a few new details: he was on the phone with his manager during the attack, which occurred as Smollett was going to get food at a Subway sandwich shop. As he was walking, he heard someone yell, “Empire!” Smollett did not respond. Then a voice called out, “F----t Empire n----r.”

“I turned around and I said, ‘The fuck did you just say to me?’” Smollett recalled. “I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘This MAGA country, n----r,’ punches me right in the face. So I punched his ass back. And then we started tussling.” At some point, Smollett said, a second person was involved, kicking his back until the two eventually ran off. His manager was still on the phone throughout; it wasn’t until afterward that Smollett said he noticed the rope that had been hung around his neck.

“I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming,” Smollett said. “And I said, ‘There’s a fucking rope around my neck.’”

One sticking point for skeptics has been Smollett’s refusal to hand his phone over to police. “They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours,” Smollett said on G.M.A. “I’m sorry, but I’m not gonna do that. Because I have private pictures, and videos, and numbers. My partner’s number; my family’s number; my castmates’ numbers; my friends’ numbers. My private e-mails, my private songs, my private voice memos . . . and honestly, by then, inaccurate, false statements had already been put out there.” He added that he believes if he had described his attackers as Muslim, Mexican, or black, his doubters would have supported him more—“and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country.”"

The Empire star was attacked by two masked men while walking down a street on January 29. They allegedly poured a chemical substance over him and wrapped a rope around his neck while shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

The 36-yer-old actor has now spoken about the attack publicly for the first time in an interview with ABC News.

He said: ""I will never be the man who this didn't happen to.

""I am forever changed and I don't subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.""

The actor also said he believes he was targeted because of his criticism of US President Donald Trump and his administration.

Smollett said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story.

He said: ""I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.

""It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon in the music business drama Empire, came out as gay in 2015. He said he hopes that speaking about the attack will help other people.

""I want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children, to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky"", he said.

Police have made no arrests for the attack. They have released CCTV images of ""people of interest"" they are seeking for questioning."

A tearful Jussie Smollett has said he has been “forever changed” by the allegedly racist and homophobic attack he suffered at the hands of two masked men in Chicago last month.

Speaking with ABC News, the 36-year-old actor said he felt a responsibility to turn publicity around the incident into something “meaningful”.

During a wide-ranging interview broadcast on the American news channel, Smollett cried as he described the attack and its aftermath.

He said: “I will never be the man who this didn’t happen to.

“I am forever changed and I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

Asked what message he wanted to send by speaking about the attack, he replied: “I want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children, to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky.”

Chicago police said on Thursday evening that its detectives had identified the persons of interest in the area of the attack and that they were being questioned, but that they were not being treated as suspects.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance and shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before looping what police said was a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck.

He said he found it insulting that people had implied the attack might have been the result of a “date gone bad”, suggesting such claims were motivated by homophobia.

“I’ve also heard that it was a date gone bad, which I so resent, that narrative. I’m not going to go out and get a tuna sandwich and salad to meet somebody.

“There’s (gay dating apps) Grindr, yes, there’s Jack’d, yes, there are all these things. I’ll admit I was on that back in the day. I was single, you know what I’m saying. But I haven’t been on that in years.”

Challenged as to why he had not handed his phone to police immediately after the attack, Smollett replied that he had wanted to protect personal details kept on the device.

He said: “They wanted me to give my phone to tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but I’m not going to do that. I have private pictures and videos and numbers, private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.

“By then inaccurate false statements had already been put out there.”

Smollett was also asked about reports, since proven false, that his attackers wore Make America Great Again hats.

He said: “I didn’t need to add anything like that. There’s no way to cut it. You don’t need some Maga hat to be the cherry on top of a racist sundae.”

Police have made no arrests and said they have found no surveillance video that shows the attack.

They released film of two people in the area at the time who they said were persons of interest.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who was viciously assaulted in Chicago earlier this month, appeared on Good Morning America on Thursday to speak at length about both the alleged attack and the doubt with which his story has been met. In it, he discusses a number of the story’s most striking details, including that he was doused in bleach and had a rope tied around his neck. He also confirms that the attackers told him this was “MAGA country,” but disputes reports that he said they were also wearing red MAGA hats.

“[Rumors] said that they were wearing MAGA hats—I never said that. I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said, adding that they called him a number of homophobic and racial slurs. “I don’t need to add a MAGA hat as a cherry on the racist sundae.”

Still, based on the comments he alleges were made by his attackers, he wouldn’t be surprised if the assault was politically motivated. “I come really really hard against 45. I come really really hard against his administration. I don’t hold my tongue,” he said, adding, “I can only go off of their words.”

Smollett also addressed the doubts and speculation that have sprouted up in the wake of his claims, despite the actor sustaining bruised ribs and injuries to his clavicle bone. “I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,” he said. “ I feel like if I had said it was a Muslim, a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would support me a lot more, and I feel like that’s an issue in our country right now.”

A point of contention for some was Smollett’s initial refusal to hand his full phone records over to Chicago law enforcement. Those records could prove that Smollett was, as he claims, on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, at the time of the attack. Moore corroborates much of Smollett’s story.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that,” Smollett said. “I have private pictures and videos and numbers. My partner’s number, my family’s numbers, my cast mates’ numbers, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my songs.” He’s since handed over records that Chicago law enforcement call “limited and heavily redacted.”

Smollett became emotional when he was asked how he’d react if the attackers were never found. “I don’t know,” he said. “Let’s just hope that they are. Let’s not go there yet. I was talking to a friend and I said, ‘I just want them to find them,’ and she said, ‘Sweetie, they’re not going to find them.’ So I’m just going to be left here with this? I’m just going to be left here, and they get to go free and go about their lives and maybe attack someone else? And I’m left here with this aftermath, with this bullshit...I still want to believe with everything that’s happened that there’s something called justice.”

""It's like, you know, at first it's a thing of like – listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it, 'cause it's the truth,"" the ""Empire"" star told Robin Roberts in an interview with ""Good Morning America."" ""Then it became a thing of like, oh, how can you doubt that? Like how do you not believe that? It's the truth. And then it became a thing of like, ohhh, it's not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

The Chicago Police Department threw cold water on reports Thursday night that ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett staged his own attack in response to his character being written off of the show.

The interview aired hours before Chicago police said they had identified and were questioning two persons of interest they had been searching for.

""After a meticulous investigation with the use of advance technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records, detectives have identified two persons of interest in the Empire cast member case,"" police said in a statement.

A police official said the persons of interest are affiliated with ""Empire,"" but gave no further information about their specific roles or connections to the show, NBC News reported.

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that two masked men punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's account to detectives included that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The alleged attack occurred in the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street about 2 a.m. as the actor returned home from an early-morning visit to a Subway restaurant, according to the police report.

Smollett said in the interview that he was left in shock after the incident and initially didn't want to report it to police.

""I was looking at myself, just like checking myself out. I saw the bruise on my neck, you know, like the little -- the rope burn around my neck,"" he said. ""So when the police came I kept the clothes on, I kept the rope on me... I mean, it wasn't, like, wrapped around. But, yeah, it was around because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett said he's ""pissed off"" not just by the attack itself but by those questioning his story.

""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f-----, they called me a n------. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

The Chicago police report lists the weapon in the alleged attack as ""hand, feet, teeth, etc.""

""He is a victim,"" Chicago police Supt. Eddie Johnson recently said of Smollett. ""And we treat him like a victim. He's been very cooperative.""

Hours of surveillance video from multiple cameras in the area where Smollett says the attack happened have been reviewed.

Smollett handed over redacted phone records to Chicago police Monday, but authorities said the records ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted.""

A representative for Smollett said the redacted records were to protect the privacy of his contacts.

""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that,"" Smollett said in the interview. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my castmate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""

Only one image has been released of the persons of interest who police had been searching for, and officials didn't immediately say if the men they were questioning were connected to the incident.

""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them,"" Smollett said. ""Never did."""

Smollett has accused two assailants of hitting him over the head while wearing ski masks and yelling homophobic and racial slurs, along with placing a noose around his neck and pouring bleach on him. Despite the Chicago PD stating that they have “no reason to doubt” the statements made by Smollett and his manager, a vocal contingent remains skeptical that the assault happened. Presumably, these folks take issue with Smollett not handing over his phone records and the unfortunate fact that the attackers haven’t been found, although police are still seeking these two men for questioning.

The actor and singer, who previously insisted that he’s remained “100% factual and consistent” while speaking to law enforcement, told Roberts that he’s not only angry about being physically attacked but at how some have assailed him with doubts. He also believes that if his attackers weren’t white, then perhaps those doubters would be behaving differently:

“I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks. Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.” “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett, who has been supported by countless public figures in solidarity, including Umbrella Academy star Ellen Page (who blamed VP Mike Pence for his policies and views that she thinks contributed to the normalization of homophobia), also takes umbrage in the below clip at those who keep calling this an “alleged attack.” He stresses that he fought back, and his attackers fled, and he hopes that he can inspire young gay men to not only learn to defend themselves if necessary but “learn to fight for what you believe in.”

He then shed tears while describing how a friend told him that his attackers probably wouldn’t be found by law enforcement. He admitted to feeling “angry” about that inevitability while wondering, “So, I’m just gonna be left here with this?” Despite everything that’s gone down, however, Smollett hopes for a different outcome. “I want to believe,” he declared. “With everything that has happened, that there is something called justice.”

Vanessa Tyson said she was assaulted by Fairfax at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, Massachusetts.

The Washington Post reports, “Debra Katz, the attorney who represents Vanessa Tyson, said she is working to schedule a meeting between Tyson and staff for Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins after she offered assistance and an opportunity to file a criminal complaint.” It is not clear whether she will file a criminal complaint.

A spokesperson for Fairfax said, “The Lt. Governor has stated repeatedly that he has never sexually assaulted anyone ever. He has called publicly for a fair, impartial investigation. He has nothing to hide. In that event, the Lt. Gov. will explore all options with regard to filing his own criminal complaint in response to the filing of a false criminal complaint against him.”

Tyson’s lawyer responded with, “Dr. Tyson will not be bullied and she will not be deterred by such threats.”

Vanessa Tyson said Fairfax forced her to give him oral sex during the summer of 2004. Public support for Tyson has been steadily growing since she released a statement detailing her accusation. And although she originally said she has no intention of seeking any charges against Fairfax, the legal door remained open for officials in Boston, where Tyson was allegedly sexually assaulted, and North Carolina, where the second accuser, Meredith Watson, said she was raped. Watson came forward on Feb. 8 and claimed Fairfax raped her while they were students at Duke University in 2000, according to a report from the Washington Post.

The statute of limitations in Massachusetts for criminal allegations of a sexual nature is 15 years, which means local law enforcement in Boston has until some point in July this year to file charges against Fairfax.

But in North Carolina, there is no statute of limitations for first-degree forcible rape, according to RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization. That means that law enforcement in both states have time to decide whether they think there is a viable case to prosecute.

Fairfax has denied Tyson and Watson’s claims, saying both incidents were consensual. They have both called on him to resign, which he has not. However, two out of three of his government staffers have resigned and two employees of his political action committee resigned, according to Richmond.com.

Fairfax has also been put on paid leave as a lawyer at the firm Morrison & Foerster.

CHICAGO -- Chicago police said Thursday night that local media reports that the attack against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

The reports surfaced as detectives were questioning two ""persons of interest"" who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren't considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the ""supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea ""patently ridiculous.""

""(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country,"" referencing President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing ""MAGA"" hats were inaccurate.

""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Smollett said he didn't want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn't remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

He also said he didn't initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation .

The reports surfaced as detectives were questioning two “persons of interest” who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

He sat down with Robin Roberts on “Good Morning America.”

The 36-year-old actor and singer made it clear that he was not lying, despite mixed reporting from the notoriously corrupt Chicago Police Department and online rumors, saying, “For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing. I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—-, they called me a n—-. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

On rumors that he was meeting someone from a dating app, “I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative. I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive,” he added.

He also addressed reports that he refused to give his phone to police, “They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that. Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos. I don’t know what that’s gonna be, to hand over my phone for — and honestly, by then, inaccurate, false statements had already been put out there.”

Smollett also said he was optimistic when he was told there was a camera where the attack took place, however, the camera was in the opposite direction, which he had no control over. However, the “Empire” actor has another theory on why people are doubting him, “I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more.. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.” Watch below:

The Chicago Police Department has dropped the ball from the beginning with their handling of the case in the media. First, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants. Then, hours later, there were two “persons of interest” on video. They also claimed the “Empire” actor “refused” to give the cops his phone.

The Chicago Police Department said Monday afternoon that the 36-year-old actor submitted his phone records but it was “limited and redacted” from within an hour of the alleged incident. The CPD also said in a statement, “We are very appreciative of the victims cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted. Detectives may be following up with him to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.”

On Feb. 9, while walking to a subway, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor after he exited the restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Threatening letters directed at Smollett were reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago a week before. The cutout letters read, “You will die black f**.” See below:

Hopefully, Jussie Smollett gets justice.

Speaking with ABC News, the 36-year-old actor said he felt a responsibility to turn publicity around the incident into something “meaningful”.

During a wide-ranging interview broadcast on the American news channel, Smollett cried as he described the attack and its aftermath.

He said: “I will never be the man who this didn’t happen to.

“I am forever changed and I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

Asked what message he wanted to send by speaking about the attack, he replied: “I want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children, to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky.”

Chicago police said on Thursday evening that its detectives had identified the persons of interest in the area of the attack and that they were being questioned, but that they were not being treated as suspects.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance and shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before looping what police said was a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck.

He said he found it insulting that people had implied the attack might have been the result of a “date gone bad”, suggesting such claims were motivated by homophobia.

For the first time since his reported homophobic and racist attack in January, Jussie Smollett is formally speaking out in a televised interview.

Smollett recounted the incident to Robin Roberts on Good Morning America Thursday morning, a night which started when his creative director (who is also “like [his] uncle”) Frank Gaston picked him up from the airport. Once they got to the apartment, Smollett decided to head to the nearby Walgreens and Subway. While on the phone with his manager, he suddenly heard someone behind him say, “Empire!” referring to the Fox show he stars in.

“And, I don’t answer to Empire, my name ain’t Empire!” Smollett chuckled, incredulously. Then, after not answering, the actor claims he heard, “Faggot, Empire, nigger!”

After turning around with a retort of “ ‘ Fuck you just say to me?”, that’s when Smollett says the attacker in the mask hurled, “This is MAGA country, nigger!” and punched him. Smollett offered a punch in return and the two scuffled. He cited “a second person involved” who started kicking him in his back— “then it just stopped.”

Smollett further noted he believes the images of two persons of interest that later surfaced on surveillance cameras are of the two men, based on his memory of the men’s stature and build.

Smollett also touched on the skepticism he’s received since the reports have surfaced, as skeptics have pointed out bits of his story that don’t necessarily add up for them. However, Smollett responded to any implications that his reports to the Chicago Police Department have been inconsistent or false.

The full statement from Smollett’s team, via Deadline, reads:

Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police. Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice. Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack. Chicago Police have not told us that they are rejecting any records, nor have they expressed concerns about the records to us. Therefore, we don’t feel compelled to be bated into responding to uncorroborated press reports. We are dealing directly with the Chicago Police Department.

Like most of his supporters, it looks like the Empire star believes the pushback is simply due to their refusal to acknowledge the very real homophobia and racism occurring in today’s society.

“It’s not just that you don’t want to believe the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth,” uttered the 36-year-old actor-singer."

Jussie Smollett bravely gave his first televised interview since his attack in Chicago.

As we reported, the Empire star was allegedly the victim of a possible hate crime when two white men fractured one of his ribs, put a noose around his neck, poured a substance believed to be bleach on him, and yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

In an interview with Good Morning America, the 36-year-old told Robin Roberts that he is “pissed off” by the skepticism surrounding his case. He remarked:

“I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks… Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth… Then it became a thing of, like, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.”

As seen below:

As we reported last month, Chicago PD released a screen grab from surveillance footage that shows two persons of interest who were in the area at the time of the alleged assault.

Smollett wholeheartedly believes the two pictured men were his attackers. He said:

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

When Roberts asked why he was so certain, he responded:

“Cause I was there.”

“I’m pissed off,” he told ABC’s Robin Roberts in his first interview. “It’s the attackers, but it is also the attack.”

Smollett, who is openly gay, has faced increasing skepticism about the details of the Jan. 29 attack, but he maintains his story is accurate. He says that a few hours after landing back in Chicago late at night, he went searching for food, first to a Walgreens he thought was open all night, and then to a Subway, where he had a sandwich and salad.

On his way home, while he was on a phone call with his manager, he says they yelled “Empire” as he crossed the street and then repeated the call with homophobic and racial slurs.

Then one of the men punched him. “So I punched his ass back,” the Empire star said. After tussling on ice, the two attackers ran off, leaving Smollett to discover that they had hung a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him in what was clearly a racial attack.

“I could only go off of their words. I mean, who says ‘F----- Empire n-----, this is MAGA country, n-----, ties a noose around your neck, and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight?”

Smollett has been called to defend his story after questions emerged about the timing of the events as he described them and suggestions that he was really out to try to pick someone up.

“It’s unbelievable to me that anything of this has come to this,” he said. “That every single thing that I have done, every single thing that I have cooperated with, somehow has gotten twisted into being some bull that it’s not.”

After the attack, which his manager heard via his cellphone, Smollett went home and called 911, leaving his clothes the way they were and the noose around his neck. “I was looking at myself, just like checking myself out. I saw the bruise on my neck, you know, like the little—the rope burn around my neck,” he told GMA. “So when the police came I kept the clothes on, I kept the rope on me... I mean, it wasn’t, like, wrapped around. But, yeah, it was around because I wanted them to see.”

He said in those moments while he waited for the police to show up, he even doubted what was happening. “At first, I thought if told the truth, that would be it because it’s the truth,” he said. “Then it was like, ooh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see that this is the truth.”

He described the assailants to police as best he could given their heavy winter gear. Authorities have been able to find surveillance video that backs up his claims, but no one has yet been arrested.

“For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,” Smollett said. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f----, they called me a n----. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

He decided to start talking about the attack to try to clear up the lies. “I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” he said. “And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”"

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has given his first interview since surviving a racist, homophobic attack in Chicago last month that left him hospitalized.

Smollett sat down with Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts to discuss his assault, in which two men wearing ski masks placed a noose around his neck, shouted slurs and poured an unknown chemical substance on him. Police are currently investigating the January 29 attack as a “possible hate crime.”



Smollett told Robins:

“I just want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky... I get threatened all the time on Instagram and Twitter and DMs and things like that. You know, I’m a public figure. I’m very outspoken. Sometimes maybe too outspoken, but its who I am. I get the idea of pissing people off, that you’re gonna rub people the wrong way.”

On the verge of tears, Smollett described his frustration with conservative media’s portrayal of his attack as an alleged hate crime and desire to find footage of the assault:

“I want that video found so badly for probably four reasons. Number one, I want them to find the people that did it. Number two, I want them to stop being able to say ‘alleged attack.’ Number three, I want them to see that I fought back. And I want a little gay boy, who might watch this, to see that I fought fucking back. And it doesn’t take anything away from people that are not able to do that, but I fought back. They ran off, I didn’t.”

He continued:

“I was talking to a friend and I said, ‘I just want them to find them,’ and she said, ‘Sweetie, they’re not going to find them.’ That just made me so angry because I’m just going to be left here with this? You know what I’m saying? I’m just going to be left here? So they get to go free? And go about their life and possibly attack someone else? And I’m here left with the aftermath of this bull? That’s not cool to me. That’s not cool to me. That’s not okay. I understand how difficult it will be to find them, but we gotta.”

When asked what he would say to a young gay person, he responded simply, “Learn to fight... Learn to be a fighter. I’m not advocating violence at all, so let’s be clear about that. If you’re going to die, fight until you do. Because if you don’t fight, you have no chance. I have fought for love. I’m an advocate.”

According to the interview, Smollett received a threatening letter to Fox studios, Empire’s parent company, full of an unidentified powder one week before the attack. “The return address said, in big red caps, MAGA. Did I make that up, too?”

Jussie Smollett thinks it's important the video of his attack is found, not just so that his attack can be fought but so that people can see he fought back.

The ""Empire"" star sat down with Robin Roberts and detailed his attack for the ""Good Morning America"" host. He went into detail about the incident, describing in detail what went down.

Smollett says he was confronted by his masked attacker, who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, and punched in the face before a second man joined in.

""We ended up tussling by the stairs, fighting, fighting, fighting,"" Smollett said. ""There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back, and then it just stopped. And they ran off.""

He says he didn't notice the rope around his neck and until afterward.

""I noticed the rope around my neck, and I started screaming,"" Jussie Smollett told Roberts. ""I said, 'There’s a f**king rope about my neck.'""

Police have been unable to find the video of the attack but Smollett is hoping they do, for many reasons.

""I want that video found so badly,"" Smollett said. ""Because, for probably four reasons. Number one, I want them to find the people that did it. Number two, I want them to stop being able to say 'alleged attack.'""

Smollett choked up as he continued, ""Number three, I want them to see that I fought back. And I want a little gay boy, who might watch this, to see that I fought f**king back ... They ran off, I didn't.""

Police have released a photo of the alleged attacks walking away after the incident but so far no suspects have been identified."

Jussie Smollett is finally speaking up after reports of his brutal attack by racist, homophobic MAGA must.

Smollett sat down with Robin Roberts of Good Morning America for his first interview detailing his attack last month. He said he was in the middle of picking up some food from Subway in Chicago and was on the phone with his manager when someone called him a racist and homophobic slur.

Jussie said a guy in a mask then punched him screaming “This MAGA country ni**er,” and Jussie punched him back, which resulted in a short scuffle outside. He said a second unknown guy jumped in, kicking Jussie in his back.

In the interview with Robin, Jussie also addressed the doubters who might’ve thought he was lying about the whole incident:

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now…It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.

Smollett, who portrays the openly gay musician Jamal on Empire, said he suffered injuries to his clavicle bone and ribs during the attack.

However, some still questioned his story:

“For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,” Smollett said. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—-, they called me a n—-. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Jussie also addressed rumors that he was in the middle of a late night love visit when he got attacked. “I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.” Jussie was actually hanging with his friend and creative director Frank Gatson in an apartment, and they got hungry, which prompted the Subway visit.

Smollett said the only reports he heard that were inaccurate were the ones claiming the attackers were wearing MAGA hats, which they weren’t.

Smollett also explained why he was initially reluctant to hand over his phone to the police:

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that. Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

Jussie didn’t even want to call the police at first, but Gatson did it on his behalf. When the cops arrived, they said they found Smollett in his apartment with stained clothing and a “white rope draped around” his neck, according to the report.

“I was looking at myself, just like checking myself out. I saw the bruise on my neck, you know, like the little — the rope burn around my neck,” he said. “So when the police came I kept the clothes on, I kept the rope on me. … I mean, it wasn’t, like, wrapped around. But, yeah, it was around because I wanted them to see.”

Jussie said he believes the photos released of the two possible suspects are accurate. He’s hopeful that the police will track the culprits down, and he hopes his story will inspire other marginalized groups:

“I think people need to hear the truth,” Jussie said. “Cause everybody has their own idea. Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community — young, black children — to know how strong that they are.”

In his first interview since the attack in Chicago, Empire star Jussie Smollett sat down with Good Morning America‘s Robin Roberts to share his full account, as well as address those accusations that he made it all up. ""I'm pissed off,"" he had said of such claims in a promo clip released ahead of Thursday's segment.

As Smollett, 36, already reported to police but reiterated to Roberts, Frank Gatson, the actor's friend and creative director, picked him up from the airport and brought him back to his apartment. Realizing there wasn't any food, Smollett went out first to Wallgreens, thinking it was open 24-hours, but then called Gatson to say he was instead going to Subway.

""I went to the Subway, got my order,"" Smollett continued. ""During that time I texted my manager, thinking that he was still in Australia… I said, ‘Call me when you can.' He called me immediately and while he was on the phone, I heard as I was crossing the intersection, ‘Empire!' And I don't answer to Empire, my name ain't Empire. And I didn't answer, I kept walking, and then I heard, ""f— Empire n—.' So I turned around and I said, ‘What the f– did you just say to me?' And I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘This MAGA country, n–,' and he punched me right in the face. So I punched his a— back and then we started tussling.""

The actor remembered, ""there was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back and then it just stopped and they ran off."" It was only after getting back on the phone (which was still on during the attack) with his manager that he realized there was a noose around his neck and a liquid (that appeared to be bleach) poured on his person. ""It happened so fast,"" he said. ""It felt like minutes but it was probably 30 seconds.""

Smollett also cleared up some false reports that his ribs had allegedly been fractured. ""My clavicle was messed up, my ribs were bruised but nothing was cracked,"" he said. ""Like, I walked into the hospital, I walked out of the hospital.""

Chicago police found Smollett's account to be credible and consistent, but an ongoing investigation has yet to find surveillance footage of the attack. Authorities released photos of persons of interest, but they also haven't found footage of Smollett's entire walk back home. Paired with the delay in handing over specific phone records deemed acceptable by police, some outlets and individuals began spreading the idea that this was all a ""hoax.""

""It became a thing of like, ‘Oh, It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth,'"" he said. ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" he added. ""A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country.""

Smollett pointed to reports that he allegedly described the attackers as wearing MAGA hats, which he didn't say: ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f–, they called me a n–. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of a racist sundae.""

Another narrative Smollett found to be ""ridiculous and offensive"" was the claim the attack was just ""a date gone bad.""

However, one of the biggest talking points for Smollett's dissenters involves his phone. So he explained, ""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for 3-4 hours. I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna do that."" He noted his phone contains sensitive information, including ""private pictures and videos,"" his partner's number, his cast mates numbers, and his family's numbers. ""I don't know what that's gonna be to hand over my phone,"" he said. ""And, honestly, by then inaccurate, false statements had already been put out there.""

On why he didn't immediately call the police, Smollet, an openly gay man, said, ""There's a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I'm not weak. I am not weak. And we, as [LGBTQ] people, are not weak.""

President Trump, whose ""Make America Great Again"" 2016 campaign slogan was said to be uttered by the attackers, previously addressed the assault on Smollett. ""That I can tell you is horrible,"" he told the press. ""I've seen it. Last night. It's horrible. Doesn't get worse.""

""I don't know what to say to that,"" Smollett said. ""I appreciate him not brushing over it.""

When it comes to his attackers' motivations, the actor, who mentioned he comes out ""really really hard against"" Trump, said he can only judge the situation based on their words. ""Who says, ‘F— Empire n—,' ‘This MAGA country, n—,' ties a noose around your neck and pours bleach on you, and this is just a friendly fight?"" he asked.

""I will never the man that this did not happen to,"" he said. ""And I don't subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us. Good and bad.""

Jussie Smollett is setting the record straight about his attack in an apparent hate crime in Chicago last month.

The Empire actor, 36, appeared on Thursday’s Good Morning America for his first in-depth, television interview since the Jan. 29 incident, detailing to Robin Roberts what occurred while hitting back at critics who have questioned the accuracy of his account.

“I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed,” Smollett said during the interview. “And I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason. But I do subscribe to the reason that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

“I think that what people need to hear is just the truth,” he said. “Everybody has their own idea. Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people — young members of the LGBT community, young black children — to know how strong they are. To know the power that they hold in their little pinky.”

Smollett explained that he landed in Chicago, where Empire was filming, and was picked up at the airport by friend and creative director Frank Gatson. When they arrived at the apartment, where they were staying, there was no food, Smollett recalled. So he went in search of something to eat.

“I went out to Walgreens, thinking that they were 24-hours, and to have a smoke,” Smollett said. “Walgreens was closed so I called [Frank] up and I said, ‘Hey, I’m going to walk over to Subway, which is across the street, and I’m going to get a salad. Do you want anything?’ ”

While getting his order at Subway, Smollett texted his manager Brandon Moore, thinking Moore was still in Australia on tour with one of his clients. Moore, instead, called him “immediately.”

While on the phone, Smollett left the Subway to return home. That’s when he claims he was approached by his alleged attackers.

“I heard, as I was crossing the intersection, I heard, ‘Empire,‘ ” Smollett said. “I don’t answer to Empire. My name ain’t Empire and I didn’t answer. I kept walking. And then I heard, ‘F—ing Empire n—–.’ ”

“I turned around and I said, ‘What the f— did you just say to me?’ ‘ Smollett recalled to GMA. “I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘This is MAGA country, n—–‘ [and] punches me right in the face. So I punched his ass back.”

“We started tussling, it was very icy. We ended up tussling by the stairs. Fighting, fighting, fighting,” the actor continued. “There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back. Then it just stopped and they ran off. And I saw where they ran.”

The attackers gone, Smollett grabbed his phone — which he said had fallen out of his pocket — and told Moore what had happened. “I was like, ‘I was just jumped,’ ” Smollett remembered saying. “And then I looked down and see that there was a rope around my neck, I hadn’t noticed it before. … I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming, ‘There’s a rope around my neck.’ “

The entire attack lasted “probably, like, 30 seconds,” according to Smollett. “It happened so fast,” he said.

From there, Smollett said he returned to his apartment where he called the police. While waiting for the cops to arrive, which he claimed took about a half hour, he inspected his injuries.

“I saw the bruise around my neck, the rope burn around my neck. But I smelled bleach. I know the smell of bleach. I saw on my sweatshirt it had marks on it, spots on it, when you have a bad bleach job. Then I was like, ‘There’s bleach on me too,’ ” Smollett said on GMA. “So when the police came, I kept the clothes on. I kept the rope. It wasn’t wrapped around but it was around. Because I wanted them to see. I wanted them to see what this was.”

He also claimed he took a second round of police officers to the scene of the incident. “I went down where it happened and I walked them through exactly what happened,” Smollett said. “And I looked them up and saw there is a camera directly on the light post that is in the intersection. So I’m like, ‘There it is.’ … And [later] the detective told me the camera inside of the casing was facing north, so they didn’t have it.”

Body descriptions were given by Smollett of his alleged attackers. “I saw [his eyes through the mask] but I didn’t see … I can’t tell you what color their eyes were and I did not see anything except the second person, I saw running around,” Smollett said on GMA. “The first person, I saw his stature the best that I could. You have to understand also that it’s Chicago. People can wear ski masks and nobody’s going to question that.”

Cops eventually released a photo of two persons of interest they were investigating. “For me when that was released, I was like, ‘Okay, we’re getting somewhere,’ ” Smollett said. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

Also during the GMA interview, Smollett cleared up some of the inaccuracies and looming questions that were reported in his case, including why he asked police officers to turn off their body cameras and why he did not want to hand over his cell phone to investigators.

“I asked them to turn their bodycams off because they were trying to stay in the hallway. I was like, ‘Please just come in because I don’t want a big scene with the neighbors,’ ” Smollett explained.

As for the phone? “They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three, four hours. I’m sorry, I’m not going to do that,” Smollettt said. “I have private pictures and videos and numbers. My partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmates’ numbers, my friend’s numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos. I don’t know what that’s going to be to hand over my phone. And honestly, by then, inaccurate false statements had already been put out there.”

Smollett has since turned over some of his phone records, his lawyers telling GMA that he is cooperating with police.

It was reported that Smollett had said his attackers were wearing “Make America Great Again” hats, though Smollett cleared that rumor up, too. “I never said that,” he stressed. “They called me a n—–. They called me a f—–. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

He also detailed his injuries. “They did x-rays. It was reported that I had fractured ribs or cracked ribs, that wasn’t true, I was just in a lot of pain,” Smollett said. “My clavicle was messed up, my rib was bruised, but nothing was cracked. I walked into the hospital, I walked out of the hospital.”

Overall, the star was frustrated by many of the critics who have questioned whether he was telling the truth.

“I’m pissed off,” he said. “It’s the attackers but it’s also the attack. At first it’s, if I tell the truth, then that’s because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, ‘How can you doubt that? It’s the truth.’ And then it became a thing of, ‘It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.’ ”

One of the things that bothered him the most? Reports that he was not going to Subway, but that his attack was “a date gone bad.”

“I so resent that narrative,” Smollett said. “Subway is open 24-hours for a reason. So that when you’re hungry at night, you go to subway. … I’m not gonna go and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous and it’s offensive. Yes, there’s [hookup apps] … I was on that back in the day, I was single. But I have not been on that in years.”

Smollett stressed: “We live in a society where as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak. And I am not weak. I am not weak, and we as a people are not weak.”

Asked why he was targeted, Smollett suggested that it was because of the critical things he has said about President Trump. “I come really, really hard against 45. I come really, really hard against his administration. I don’t hold my tongue,” Smollett told Roberts on GMA.

“I can only go off of their words. ‘Who says ‘F—– Empire n—–, this MAGA country n—–,’ ties a noose around your neck, and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight?”"

9:00 AM PT -- Cops say they have identified 2 ""persons of interest,"" and have questioned them ... but add there is no evidence they were involved in Jussie's attack. Neither has been charged with a crime.

While PD won't confirm the persons of interest are the ones in the dark, grainy image -- the ones Jussie says he's sure attacked him -- our law enforcement sources say the people in the image are the only people who were seen on camera the night of Jussie's attack.

Jussie Smollett says he's certain ... the 2 men in the surveillance photo released by police are way more than persons of interest ... they are the men who screamed homophobic and racist epithets at him, tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him and beat him.

Jussie appeared on 'GMA' Thursday, and was clearly frustrated some people don't believe his story.

The 2 men in the surveillance photo are considered ""persons of interest"" but not suspects by the Chicago PD. Cops tell us the video shows the 2 men on the other side of the street from Jussie, but there is a 60-second gap in the video.

Jussie went on to explain why he refused to give his phone to cops so they could validate his story that he was talking to his manager at the time of the attack and the manager heard it go down. Jussie explained he had various private photos, videos and phone numbers and did not want that data compromised.

He tells Robin Roberts about his injuries and why he kept the rope around his neck until police arrived."

“I never said that!” Smollett said. (RELATED: Authorities Seeking ‘Persons Of Interest’ In ‘Empire’ Star Jussie Smollett’s Alleged Attack)

WATCH:

Several media outlets reported that Smollett said the alleged attackers wore MAGA hats, but Smollett says that’s inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” Smollett said. “They called me a [bleep]. They called me a [bleep]. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett has claimed two men beat him up, tied a rope around his neck, said racial and homophobic slurs and threw an unidentified chemical substance on him on Jan. 29, according to The Associated Press.

He claimed in a follow-up interview with the Chicago Police Department that the men said “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett also challenged another narrative that the attack was the result of a date gone wrong.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I so resent that narrative,” Smollett said. “I’m not going to go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive. Yes, there’s Grinder, yes, there’s Jack’d, yes there’s all of these things which I have not been on in years. I can admit that I was on it back in the day. I was single. You know what I’m saying? But I haven’t been on that in years.”

Smollett initially refused to hand over phone records, but then gave police a “heavily redacted” version of the logs.

Since the alleged hate crime, where Smollett claims the perpetrators shouted slurs and put a noose around his neck, the Chicago Police Department has been searching for evidence.

Authorities have yet to find video footage of the incident, which has led to some people doubting the actor’s claims or questioning whether he exaggerated what took place.

On Thursday, February 14, Smollett appeared on Good Morning America for his first interview since the interview and shared his side of the story.

“I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘This MAGA country (expletive), punches me right in the face” Smollett said. “So I punched his ass back. And then started tussling. It was very icy, and we ended up tussling by the stairs, fighting, fighting, fighting. There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back, and then it just stopped and they ran off.”

He then discussed the doubters.

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth,” Smollett said.

Smollett said that he is “pissed off” that the attack went down and that there is any doubt of the attack.

Smollett said late last month that he had been assaulted by two men yelling homophobic and racial slurs in downtown Chicago. He told “Good Morning America” in an interview broadcast Thursday morning that he was “pissed off” by the attack and those who doubted his story, which is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

""These individuals are not yet suspects but were in [the] area of concern and are being questioned. [The] investigation continues.""

UPDATE, 3:06 p.m. EST: Chicago Police have identified the two persons of interest seen in surveillance footage the night of Jussie Smollett's attack, stills of which were made public in January, Entertainment Tonight reports.

""These individuals are not yet suspects but were in [the] area of concern and are being questioned,"" Chicago PD chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Thursday. ""[The] investigation continues.""

In his Good Morning America interview with Robin Roberts, which aired Thursday morning, Smollett said that he thinks the persons of interest in the surveillance footage still are his attackers.

""I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,"" Smollett told Roberts. ""Never did.""

ORIGINAL: In his first televised interview since his attack, Empire star Jussie Smollett tells Robin Roberts that anyone who doesn’t believe his story is being willfully ignorant. ""It's not that you don't believe this is the truth,” he says,”you don't even want to see this is the truth.""

Smollett explained Thursday on Good Morning America that after landing in Chicago he was making a late-night run to get some food when he “heard ‘Empire,' and I don’t answer to 'Empire.' My name ain’t 'Empire,' and I didn’t answer,"" he explains. ""I kept walking, and then I heard ""(faggot) 'Empire' (N-word).' So, I turned around and I said, 'The fuck did you just say to me?'”

What Smollett says he saw was a masked attacker, who told him “'This MAGA country, (N-word).' Punches me right in the face,"" Smollett he continues. ""So I punched his ass back. And then we started tussling and it was very icy.” The two fought and a second attacker became involved, who was “kicking me in my back, and then it just stopped. And they ran off.”

The attack was over quickly, lasting about 30 seconds, and when the attackers ran off, Smollett noticed what they’d left. “I noticed the rope around my neck, and I started screaming,"" he tells Roberts. ""I said, 'There’s a fucking rope about my neck.' ""

https://gma.abc/2TW7aG8

Smollett gave police as much of a description of his attackers as he could, but due to the speed and violence of the attack he couldn’t see them well. ""I can’t tell you what color their eyes were, and I did not see anything except the second person I saw running away,"" he says. ""And the first person, I saw his stature. I gave the description as best as I could.” Identifying his assailants was made even harder by the fact that it the attack happened in the middle of winter in Chicago, meaning the men were wearing ski masks.

Earlier this week, Smollett responded to rumors that he may have been lying about the attack in a statement to Out, saying that he “is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police. Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

Jussie Smollett, the gay and black star of TV show Empire, has said that he believes he was assaulted in Chicago two weeks ago because he is an outspoken critic of Donald Trump.

In his first detailed interview since the alleged 29 January assault, Smollett was asked by Good Morning America on ABC News why he thinks he was targeted. In his reply, he referred to Trump by his moniker as the 45th president of the United States.

“I come really, really hard against 45,” he said. “I come really, really hard against his administration and I don’t hold my tongue.”

During the interview, Smollett was played a clip of Trump responding to news of the alleged attack on the actor and R&B singer. The president said: “I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned.”

The actor said he appreciated that Trump had not brushed over the event, but added that he had no doubt that his assailants were motivated by his criticism of the president. With ABC News censoring the comment on taste grounds, Smollett said: “I can only go off of their words. Who says, ‘[bleep] Empire, this Maga country,’ [bleep] ties a noose around your neck and pours bleach on to you? And this is just a friendly fight?”

Shortly after ABC News aired, Chicago police announced a potentially important development in their investigation. They said that two men had been detected in surveillance film in the area of the alleged attack and were now being questioned, though they were not being treated as suspects.

Smollett grew emotional in the TV interview and became teary. He said: “I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed.”

His family has said he suffered a hate attack, and the actor has been supported by a surge of sympathy on social media. But doubters have also questioned his account.

He addressed some of those doubts in the interview. Asked why he had taken so long to contact police after the incident he said: “There’s a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak, and we as a people are not weak.”

At first he refused to hand over his cellphone to police for forensic investigation. He said: “I’m sorry, but I’m not going to do that. I have private pictures and videos and numbers. My partner’s number, my family’s number, my cast mates’ numbers, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, songs, voicemails.”

Police have said that he has now handed over records of his phone activity at the time of the alleged attack, but that it was so heavily redacted that they needed further information.

Smollett said that on the night he had walked detectives down to the site of the alleged attack and had seen a surveillance camera right above the spot. But the camera was found to be pointing in the wrong direction to capture anything.

Smollett said he was “pissed off” not only by his attackers but also by those who had questioned the veracity of his account. “How can you doubt that, how can you not believe that, it’s the truth? And then it became, oh, it’s not that you don’t want to believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.”

He added: “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more. That says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

The actor, best known for his role as the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox TV show, said the attack happened when he was out looking for food in Chicago having just landed in the city. He was walking back to his apartment from a Subways franchise, and on the phone to his manager, when he heard someone shout at him “Empire!” from behind.

“I don’t answer to Empire so I kept walking,” he said.

He said that his assailant had used the phrase coined by Donald Trump, Make America Great Again, Maga, as he laid into the actor. “I turned around and I see the attacker masked and he said: ‘This Maga country [bleep]’ and punched me right in the face so I punched his ass right back. We started tussling and it was very icy, we ended up tussling by the stairs, fighting, fighting, fighting.”

A second attacker, Smollett said, started kicking him in the back. “Then it just stopped and they ran off. I saw where they ran off … Then I looked down and I see there was a rope around my neck. I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming. There’s a [bleep] rope around my neck!”

Chicago police, who have scoured through hundreds of hours of surveillance footage from Chicago street cameras, have found film of Smollett arriving back at his apartment with the rope still round his neck.

The actor said he had been unable to give detectives a good description of his assailants as their faces were obscured. “You have to understand it’s Chicago in winter – people can wear ski masks and nobody’s going to question that.”"

Smollett, 36, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” made the comments in an interview with ABC News that is set to air on “Good Morning America” on Thursday.

An interview clip was posted online.

“I’m pissed off,” Smollett told ABC News’ Robin Roberts. “It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks.”

Smollett told Chicago police he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him and put a rope around his neck.

The news sparked outrage on social media, but some questioned Smollett’s account. The Chicago police have not found any surveillance video evidence and have made no arrests.

“At first it was a thing of ‘Like, listen, if I tell the truth, then that’s it — cause it’s the truth,’” he said.

“Then it became a thing of ‘Like, oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that?’ It’s the truth.”

Chicago police said they are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. (Reuters/NAN)

“It’s the attackers but it’s also the attacks,” Smollett told ABC’s Robin Roberts in a Thursday interview, his first since the Jan. 29 assault in Chicago.

“At first it was a thing of like, ‘Listen if at first I tell the truth then that’s it ‘cause it’s the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like ‘Oh how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth,’” he continued, referring to questions surrounding his story. “And then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.’”

Smollett, a gay black man who plays Jamal Lyon on Fox’s “Empire,” told Chicago police he was getting food when he was attacked by two masked men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” He told police the assailants beat him up, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him.

During Thursday’s interview, Smollett revealed more details, saying the attack began after one of the men yelled “Empire” at him while he was on the phone with his manager. Smollett said the incident escalated when he didn’t respond.

“I didn’t answer, I kept walking. And then I heard ‘faggot Empire nigger,’” Smollett said. “So, I turned around and said, ‘What the fuck did you just say to me?’ I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘This MAGA county nigger’ and he punched me in the face.”

Smollett said a second man began kicking him in the back after the first man assaulted him. He said his manager was on the phone the entire time.

Smollett also addressed questions that arose after the initial reports, including why he waited to call the police and handed over a heavily-redacted version of his phone records.

“There’s a level of pride there,” Smollett said. “We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered, somehow, to be weak and I’m not weak. I am not weak. And we as a people are not weak.”

He said he didn’t hand over all his phone records immediately because he was worried about privacy.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but I’m not gonna do that. Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers,” he said.

Smollett said he hopes he can create some good from such a horrible experience.

“I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed,” he said. “I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

The FBI joined the police investigation after it was revealed that Smollett received a threatening letter prior to the attack.

Chicago police have released images of “persons of interest,” and said they found new video footage that could shed light on what happened. No new developments had been reported as of last week.

Citing anonymous law enforcement sources, CNN reported that police believe the actor may have paid two men to orchestrate the attack. Read more here.

PREVIOUSLY:

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett told “Good Morning America” he’s “pissed off” that some people have questioned his account of being attacked in an alleged racist and homophobic incident last month.

“It’s the attackers but it’s also the attacks,” Smollett told ABC’s Robin Roberts in a Thursday interview, his first since the Jan. 29 assault in Chicago.

“At first it was a thing of like, ‘Listen if at first I tell the truth then that’s it ‘cause it’s the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like ‘Oh how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth,’” he continued, referring to questions surrounding his story. “And then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.’”

Smollett, a gay black man who plays Jamal Lyon on Fox’s “Empire,” told Chicago police he was getting food when he was attacked by two masked men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” He told police the assailants beat him up, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him.

During Thursday’s interview, Smollett said the attack began after one of the men yelled “Empire” at him while he was on the phone with his manager. Smollett said the incident escalated when he didn’t respond.

“I didn’t answer, I kept walking. And then I heard ‘faggot Empire nigger,’” Smollett said. “So, I turned around and said, ‘What the fuck did you just say to me?’ I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘This MAGA county nigger’ and he punched me in the face.”

Smollett said a second man began kicking him in the back after the first man assaulted him. He said his manager was on the phone the entire time.

Smollett also addressed questions that arose after the initial reports, including why he waited to call the police and handed over a heavily-redacted version of his phone records.

“There’s a level of pride there,” Smollett said. “We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered, somehow, to be weak and I’m not weak. I am not weak. And we as a people are not weak.”

He said he didn’t hand over all his phone records immediately because he was worried about privacy.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but I’m not gonna do that. Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers,” he said.

Smollett said he hopes he can create some good from such a horrible experience.

“I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed,” he said. “I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

The FBI joined the police investigation after it was revealed that Smollett received a threatening letter prior to the attack.

Chicago police have released images of “persons of interest,” and said they found new video footage that could shed light on what happened. No new developments had been reported as of last week."

In an excerpt of McCabe’s new book published by The Atlantic, McCabe claims that Trump called him shortly after firing Comey in May 2017 to gloat about how happy he was to have the former FBI director gone.

“Boy, it’s incredible, it’s such a great thing, people are really happy about the fact that the director’s gone, and it’s just remarkable what people are saying,” Trump said, according to McCabe. “Have you seen that? Are you seeing that, too?”

However, the conversation took a more confrontational turn when Trump learned that McCabe had authorized Comey to fly home on a government airplane after he was abruptly fired while giving a talk in California. In fact, McCabe claims that Trump “flew off the handle.”

“That’s not right!” Trump yelled, according to McCabe. “I don’t approve of that! That’s wrong!”

McCabe says Trump then ordered him to investigate how Comey got authorization to fly on the plane, and McCabe informed him that it would be difficult for him to investigate his own decision.

The former deputy FBI director says that, like Comey, he created a series of contemporaneous memos about his conversations with the president in order to keep a solid record of “a person who cannot be trusted.”"

ABC/Stephen Green(NEW YORK) — Empire star Jussie Smollett’s sat down with Good Morning America‘s Robin Roberts, in his first televised interview since he claims he was attacked last month in what police are investigating as a hate crime.



In a clip from the interview, Smollett gives his impressions of the surveillance video that shows two figures whom police are seeking in connection with the alleged attack.



“I do,” Jussie responds when Roberts asks whether he believes they could be the attackers. “Because I was there. For me, when that was released, I was like, ‘Okay, we’re getting somewhere.’ …I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never didn’t.”

In an earlier preview clip, Smollett told Roberts he’s still angry about what happened to him, saying he was “p***ed off,” explaining that he was frustrated by those who thought he made up the story, citing a lack of evidence.

“Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth,” he said.

Smollett’s interview with Roberts comes almost three weeks after he told Chicago police that he was assaulted by two men during the early morning of January 22 while leaving a Subway restaurant in Chicago.

The actor-singer told police that two attackers yelled racial and homophobic slurs, beat him, poured an unknown liquid on him and put a noose around his neck.

The incident wasn’t captured on surviellance video, but cameras spotted the singer and actor returning to his apartment after the alleged attack, still carrying the Subway sandwich he’d bought before he says the incident took place.

The case is being investigated as a hate crime. So far, no arrests have been made.

Speaking with Robin Roberts in an interview that aired Thursday morning via Good Morning America, the Empire star and Sum of My Music artist expressed hurt in light of the online accusations from some that he's exaggerating the details of the attack, which is now being investigated as a suspected hate crime.

""It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth,"" Smollett said in a message to his detractors, pointing out that many of them would sadly have more likely believed his story if the perpetrators had been ""Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black.""

The attackers' alleged shouting of ""This is MAGA country,"" Smollett noted, has been a specific point of contention for his detractors. ""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said to anyone questioning that aspect of the account. ""They called me a f*****, they called me a n*****. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Ultimately, Smollett is ""pissed off"" about both the attack itself and the way some have continued to doubt his truth. ""For me, when that was released, it was like 'OK, we're getting somewhere,'"" he said of authorities' recently released photo of two possible suspects. ""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. Never did.""

Earlier this month, Smollett made his first public appearance since the attack with his performance at the Troubadour in West Hollywood. ""I couldn't let these motherfuckers win,"" he said from the stage."

“I’m p***ed off,” Smollett said as he talked about the hurt he was feeling, not just from the attack itself but from the people doubting his claims.

“At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,” he continued. “And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett, who is openly gay and plays a gay character on “Empire”, told police that he was attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racist slurs at him. He said the men put a noose around his neck, poured an unknown substance on him, and physically beat him.

During the incident, Smollett said the attackers shouted: “‘This is MAGA country.'”

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth,” he told ABC News.

“For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—–, they called me a n—-. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

The 36-year-old actor said there is no doubt in his mind that the attack was a hate crime.

“I mean, who says, ‘f—– Empire n—–,’ ‘This is MAGA country, n—–,’ ties a noose around your neck, and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight?” he asked.

“It’s unbelievable to me that anything of this has come to this. That every single thing that I have done, every single thing that I have co-operated with, somehow has gotten twisted into being some bull that it’s not.

“I think people need to hear the truth,” he added. “‘Cause everybody has their own idea. Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community — young, black children — to know how strong that they are.”"

“I will never be the man that this did not happen to,” Smollett told ABC’s Robin Roberts. “I am forever changed. I don’t subscribe to the idea everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and the responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

Smollett told Roberts he landed in Chicago that day, was picked up by his creative director and got back to his apartment only to realize he had no food in the house.

The 36-year-old “Empire” star said he left his apartment to go to Walgreens, thinking it was open 24 hours, but ended up at Subway to get a salad.

He said he texted his manager, Brandon Moore, who he believed to be in Australia with another client, and left a message for Moore to call him.

Smollett said Moore called him back immediately.

“While he was on the phone I heard, I was crossing the intersection, I heard ‘Empire!,’ Smollett told Roberts. “I don’t answer to ‘Empire.’ My name ain’t ‘Empire.'”

The actor said he didn’t respond and kept walking only to hear someone to hear someone yell a racial slur.

“So I turned around and said ‘What the f**k did you just say to me’ and I see the attacker masked,” Smollett said, appearing to get emotional. “He said ‘This MAGA country n****r’ and he punched me in the face so I punched his a** back.”

Smollett said they started tussling and ended up near some stairs, as a second person kicked him in his back.

The alleged attackers ran off and Smollett said he looked down and saw that his phone had fallen out of his pocket.

His manager was still on the line and Smollett said he told Moore he had been jumped.

Glancing down, Smollett said he saw a rope.

“I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming ‘There’s a f***ing rope around my neck,” he said.

Smollett said he gave a body description of his alleged attackers as best as he could because he doesn’t have details such as eye color.

He told Roberts he’s seen the photo police released of the persons of interest.

“For me, when that was released I was like ‘Ok, we are getting somewhere,'” Smollett said. “For me, I don’t have any doubt in my mind that’s them.”

He also explained why he hesitated to report the attack.

“There’s a level of pride there,” Smollett said. “We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I’m not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.”

Smollett said it took police about 30 minutes to respond.

During that time, the star said, he checked himself, saw his bruises and smelled bleach, so he left his clothes on as well as the rope around his neck.

Smollett said he asked the responding officers to turn off their body cams and come into his apartment because he didn’t want his neighbors witnessing the scene.

He said he went with officers outside to walk them through what happened and noticed a nearby camera only to find out later that it was pointed in the opposite direction of where he says his alleged attack happened.

Smollett expressed frustration at not being believed.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

The actor said he refused to turn over his phone to police because he has private videos, messages, music and phone numbers that he wanted to protect.

Smollett refuted some of what has been reported, including that he told police his alleged attackers were wearing MAGA hats.

“I never said that,” he said. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he assumes he was targeted because of his vocal criticism against Donald Trump and his administration, telling Roberts, “I come really hard against 45.”

Smollett said he was aware of Trump saying “It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned” when asked about the alleged attack.

“I don’t know what to say to that,” Smollett said. “You know, I appreciate him not brushing over it.”

Smollett, who identifies as gay and plays a gay character on the series, said he respects victims of hate crimes too much to lie about what happened.

He was at times emotional during the interview and said he hopes a message comes from what happened to him.

“I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community, young black children to know how strong that they are,” he said. “To know the power that they hold in their little pinkie.”

GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis responded to the interview in a statement provided to CNN.

“Jussie Smollett was victimized first in a hate-motivated and violent attack in Chicago and has since been doubly victimized as the subject of speculation by the media industry and broader culture,” the statement said. “Jussie is rising above hate, racism, homophobia, and doubt surrounding the attack and instead using his voice and talent to fight back against the rising rates of violence against Black and LGBTQ people, as well as those who live at the intersection of those identities.”"

Throughout his chat with Robin Roberts, Smollett described his frustration with those who’ve criticized him and taken a skeptical view of his attack. At one point he suggested that his doubters might have a racial agenda, saying they wouldn’t be so disbelieving if his attackers were minorities.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black (who attacked me), I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, a lot more and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

As Smollett defended his reluctance to share his phone records with the police, he grumbled about “inaccurate, false statements” that have been spread about the attack, citing one which claimed that he said his attackers wore MAGA hats. Smollett explained that this was a false add-on to what he said earlier in the interview about how his attacker supposed yelled pro-Donald Trump slogans during the assault.

“I never said that. I didn’t need to add anything like that,” Smollett said. “They called me a f*ggot, they called me a n*gger. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett continued to bash other “ridiculous” false narratives about the attack, he said that he could’ve been targeted because “I come really, really hard against 45. I don’t hold my tongue.” Smollett said he was appreciative that the president condemned the “horrible” attack on him, but as for the perpetrators, “I could only go off their words.”

“Who says ‘This is MAGA country,’ ties a noose around your neck, and pours bleach on you and this is just a friendly fight?”

Asked by Roberts why he believes he was targeted, Smollett said, “I come really, really hard against 45. I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

Watch a segment of the interview below.

In his first extensive interview since the Jan. 29 incident outside a Subway restaurant in Chicago, Smollett addressed his initial decision to withhold his cellphone from police scrutiny. Smollett told ABC News’ Roberts that the police said their tech expert would need “three or four hours” to examine the phone.

“I‘m sorry but I’m not going to do that,” Smollett said, describing his reaction. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my cast mate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

Earlier this week Smollett submitted phone records from within the hour of the 2 a.m. attack, but, according to Roberts, Chicago police said the records were “limited and heavily redacted.”

Asked about the doubts and rumors that have sprung up on social media in the two weeks since the attack, Smollett said, “If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.”

Following today’s GMA, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis released a statement saying that Smollett has been “doubly victimized” by the doubt and speculation in the media “and broader culture.”

The 36-year-old gay actor/musician contacted police in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 to report that he’d been attacked around 2 a.m. outside a Chicago Subway restaurant by two men who beat him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs and placed a rope around his neck before running off.

Smollett told Roberts that he never described the two attackers as wearing MAGA hats, despite early reports, but that they did say “This is MAGA country” as they ran off.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” Smollett said about the hats. “They called me a f*ggot. They called me a n*gger. There’s no which way you cut it, I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on a racist sundae.”

Asked why he hesitated a half hour after the attack to phone police, Smollett said, “There’s a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you’re somehow considered to be weak, and I’m not weak, and we as a people are not weak.” Smollett said he changed his mind after smelling the bleach that the attackers had thrown on him.

Smollett said he receives social media threats “all the time,” adding, “I’m a public figure, I’m very outspoken.” A letter sent to a Fox station in Chicago before the incident specifically threatened Smollett, with a stick figure hanging from a tree, a gun pointing at the figure and the word “MAGA” included.

“Did I make that up, too?” Smollett said on GMA.

Though a security camera on the street is set up in the vicinity of the Subway restaurant, it was pointed in a different direction than the alleged attack. Smollett said he hopes video surfaces not only so that the attackers are found (and so that the word “alleged” can be dropped from descriptions), but so young LGBTQ people and black children can see that Smollett fought back, “to know how strong they are.”

“I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought back,” he said, adding, “They ran off, I didn’t.”

Additional segments of the interview will air later tonight on ABC’s Nightline.

Smollett also dismissed rumors that the attack resulted from “a date gone bad,” a charge the actors said he resented, in part because he has not used dating apps for years, since when he was single. “I’m not going to go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad” for a date, he said. “That’s ridiculous, and it’s offensive.”

Smollett was on the phone with manager Brandon Z. Moore when the the men approached saying “f*cking Empire n*gger.” Smollett said he responded, “What the f*ck did you just say to me?” just before one of the two men, wearing a ski mask, struck his face, saying “”This MAGA country” and using the racial epithet. The actor said he punched back and, following a brief tussle, the men ran off.

Smollett noticed that his phone had fallen to the ground but that Moore was still on the line. “I started screaming, ‘There’s a f*cking rope around my neck.'” The actor told Roberts that he sustained bruises and injuries to his clavicle in the attack, as well as a rope burn around his neck (he kept the rope dangling from his neck for police to see, he said).

Asked by Roberts for a reaction to President Donald Trump’s on-camera response to the incident (Trump called it “I think it’s really horrible,” Trump said. “It doesn’t get worse.”), the actor said, “I don’t know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it.”"

A judge found that Paul Manafort lied to investigators after signing a plea deal with Mueller’s office

A quick refresher here: Manafort is a former Trump campaign chair. He agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s election interference.

So what just happened? US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson found that Manafort had lied about his communications with longtime associate Konstantin Kilimnik, voiding his plea deal. For context here, Kilimnik is a Russian-Ukrainian who Mueller's office says has ties to Russian intelligence.

The judge also said Manafort lied about a separate, as-yet-non-public investigation underway at the Department of Justice, and about a payment related to a debt to a law firm.

What does this mean for Manafort? In the fall, Manafort pleaded guilty to two counts, conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice. A violation of the plea agreement would hurt any argument Manafort makes for lenient sentencing.

Covington Catholic students won’t be punished after investigators found no evidence “of racist or offensive statements”

Remember the viral videos of the MAGA-hat wearing boys from a Kentucky Catholic school confronting a Native American elder? A third-party hired by the Diocese and the school has exonerated the students of wrongdoing.

The Diocese of Covington, which initially condemned the students’ behavior and said they could face expulsion, now says the students “can move forward with their lives.”

The company that carried out the investigation declined to speak to BuzzFeed News.

Mexican authorities are stopping unaccompanied kids from seeking asylum in the US at every turn. In some cases, authorities are placing the kids in protective services where their only options are to request refuge in Mexico or be deported. An activist told us, “this is a political move, and children are the victims.”

Jussie Smollett says he’s “pissed off” by people who doubt he was attacked. The Empire actor reported an attack to Chicago police that’s being investigated as a possible hate crime. Smollett says he’s angry some people doubt the attack happened.

FEMA director Brock Long has resigned after two years and multiple controversies. Long was criticized for his management of the agency's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and his use of government cars for personal business.

Kids YouTube star Blippi “regrets” the viral video in which he poops all over his friend

Have you seen Blippi? He’s a YouTube megastar for toddlers — kids are obsessed with him, and he gets around 400 million views per month, making him among the top live action entertainers for kids on the platform.

But long before inventing Blippi and pivoting to children’s entertainment, Stevin John made a colossally viral version of the Harlem Shake meme where he literally projectile pooped on a nude friend.

Still, the story isn’t about John’s children’s videos — which are so fun — or the Harlem Shake video. Instead, it’s about people who intrinsically understand creating viral fame, and how they make it happen.

I highly recommend Katie Notopoulos’ excellent piece on Blippi, whom she calls “a uniquely millennial hybrid of Mister Rogers and Jake Paul.” You can skip over the gross part if you’d like.

The teaser trailer for Frozen II will give you chills

You never quite know the tone that Disney will aim to strike with sequels of popular movies, but let me tell you, it looks like the Frozen sequel will mostly serve out distress.

The teaser trailer for the follow-up to the 2013 hit is here, and nearly every shot features a character looking terrified or deeply concerned. The movie will be released in November.

I’m mostly upset they didn’t name it Frozen: Back 2 Arendelle, or Frozen II: Back in the Habit.

Here’s Elsa trying to cross a large body of water by icing it, which is a massive and distressing undertaking."

The Empire actor, who is openly gay, spoke with Good Morning America‘s Robin Roberts about how he was attacked by two individuals who yelled racial and homophobic slurs. The attackers hit the actor with their hands and poured what the Chicago Police Department deemed an “unknown chemical substance” which Smollett says was bleach on him; one of the assailants also placed a rope around his neck.

“I will never be the man that this did not happen to,” Smollett said. “I am forever changed.”

During the interview, Smollett gave a detailed account of the attack, saying that someone calling him “Empire” and using racist and homophobic language jumped him, then another person joined the attacker. The actor also said that the perpetrators referenced President Trump’s rallying cry, “Make America Great Again,” during the attack, but dismissed reports that the assailants were wearing “MAGA” hats at the time.

Smollett pointed out that the men’s language was abusive and offensive, and said “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.” He added that he believes the attack was motivated by his public dislike for President Donald Trump, whom he referred to as “45.”

“I come really, really hard against 45. I come really hard against his administration. I don’t hold my tongue,” he said. (When asked, Trump called what Smollett endured “horrible.” In response, Smollett said: “I don’t know what to say to that, you know? I appreciate him not brushing over it.”)

The actor also clarified the depth of his injuries, stressing that he was not as damaged as initial reports made it seem. “I was just in a lot of pain. My clavicle was messed up, my rib was bruised, but nothing was broken,” he said. “I walked into the hospital, I walked out of the hospital.”

Days after the attack, Smollett went ahead with a scheduled performance at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, Calif.

“The most important thing I can say is thank you so much, and I’m OK,” Smollett reportedly said at the time. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to [be], and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.” He added: “I couldn’t let those motherf–kers win. I will always stand for love.”

Roberts questioned why Smollett, who says he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack, refused to hand the device over to police and took 13 days to provide authorities with a redacted list of his phone activity.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry, but I’m not going to do that,” he said, citing that the device held personal photos, videos and the phone numbers of his loved ones and castmates. Per the Chicago Police, Smollett’s team eventually turned over heavily redacted phone records.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,” he told “Good Morning America” in an interview with host Robin Roberts that aired on Thursday. “And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett said the attack took place on Jan. 29 at 2 a.m., after the actor says that two men jumped him, yelling racial epithets while placing a rope around his neck. A police statement said unspecified chemicals were poured on the star’s face, and a rope placed around his neck.

Chicago police have not made any arrests in the case and have issued statements seeking access to Smollett’s cellphone since he said he was on a call with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, during the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records, but a Chicago police spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said in a statement, “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

Smollett addressed why he was initially reluctant to hand over the records, saying he did not want his private information in the hands of the police.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that,” he said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”"

The 36-year-old actor got emotional as Roberts asked, “At any point during the attack, did you fear for your life?”

TMZ first broke the news that the popular actor and singer was hospitalized after being attacked by two masked white men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him as they put a noose around his neck and repeatedly punched him.

Smollett shared the graphic details of the racist and homophobic attack with Roberts.

EXCLUSIVE: @RobinRoberts sits down one-on-one with @JussieSmollett as he tells his story of being attacked in a vicious hate crime. “How do you not believe that? It’s the truth.” https://t.co/3HbyU3agVO pic.twitter.com/SLlfNBdar3 — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 14, 2019

According to Variety, the officers were informed that the actor “did not want to report the offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.”

Shortly after the attack, the Smollett family released their first statement on the assault, exclusively to theGrio.

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

During his first performance after the attack, Smollett took to the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, telling about 400 fans, “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the motherf—ers win.”

Smollett told Roberts that part of what’s been so painful is dealing with the critics who don’t want to believe the details of his assault.

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.” @JussieSmollett tells @RobinRoberts he’s “pissed off” about the attacks on him after details came out after his attack. https://t.co/3HbyU2SFxe pic.twitter.com/a2o949itIJ — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 14, 2019

When Smollett returned to the set of the Chicago-based Fox series he had a security detail. Trauma counselors from the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAF-AFTRA) were also reportedly available on the set for cast and crew members who might need support.

Inside the Investigation

Chicago police have said that they have video of Smollett walking away from the two alleged assailants and also video of him with a rope around his neck.

Smollett told Roberts he believes the two people seen in the video are his attackers.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.” @JussieSmollett tells @RobinRoberts he knows the two people captured in an image by police are the same people who attacked him that night. https://t.co/b5efiP0JCG pic.twitter.com/tcR4OSjfAA — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 14, 2019

Two weeks after police launched an investigation into the racially-charged attack on Jussie Smollett, the actor has provided his phone records to the Chicago Police Department.

“Phone records from Jussie’s manager were sent to police on Feb. 5 and Jussie’s records were sent over this morning. Both were sent to Chief of Staff to the Superintendent of Police Robert Boik, who confirmed receipt,” a spokesperson for the Empire star said in an email reports Page Six.

Cops requested Smollett’s phone records to confirm statements that he was on a call with his manager Brandon Z. Moore during the attack. Both allege the Empirestar was called a “f—-t” and a “n—-r” and Moore insists he heard the assailants yell “MAGA country.”

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told The Post on Sunday.

Smollett’s spokesperson told The Post that he “is the victim here” and “Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” the statement read.

“Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”"

Holding back tears, he said:""Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It's the truth.

""Then it became a thing of, like, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth. You don't even want to see the truth.""

The performer went back to work two weeks ago for the first time since two masked men attacked him and put a rope around his neck in Chicago, USA, in January.

The Chicago Sun Times reported that he told the crowd at the Troubador in West Hollywood: ""The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK.""

""I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.""

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Jussie walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck.

However, his phone records were rejected by police for being heavily redacted’ in the investigation into his brutal racist attack.

TMZ reported that the PDF file the 35-year-old star submitted could have been ""manipulated"" - claiming that numbers may have been added or deleted - although police told the publication that there is no evidence that the file had been altered.

Reports of the attack drew both a flood of outrage and support for Jussie on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Jussie's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" a reference to Donald Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again"".

In the interview, Smollett says he is sure two men spotted in surveillance footage from the area were his attackers. ""When that was released, I was like, 'Okay. We're getting somewhere,' you know what I'm saying?"" he says. ""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. Never did."" The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Chicago Police Supt.

LONDON - Jussie Smollett is p###ed off that people don't believe the truth about him being attacked in a racist and homophobic assault last month.

The _Empire _actor was subjected to an alleged hate crime last month when two assailants allegedly hurled homophobic abuse before punching him, pouring an unknown chemical substance over him and putting a rope around his neck, and not only is he still angry about what happened to him, he's also annoyed that there have been so many false rumours surrounding the incident.

Speaking out for the first time in a preview of his upcoming interview on Good Morning America, he said: ""I'm p###ed off.""

Asked why by host Robin Roberts, he replied: ""It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks. It's not that you don't believe this is the truth; you don't want to see this is the truth. It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of like 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth.' Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you - how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' ""

Earlier this week, a spokesperson for the 36-year-old star - who was on the phone to his manager at the time of the attack - defended Smollett after it was claimed he had turned over his phone records to police but they were limited and heavily redacted and so did not ""meet the burden for a criminal investigation"".

However, the actor's representative insisted he had been as co-operative as possible.

They said in a statement: ""Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim.

""We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie's attackers and bring them to justice. Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.""

Smollett returned to public life on 2 February, where he told fans at a concert at Hollywood's Troubadour club that he had not fully healed yet and was still suffering from bruised ribs.

The Alien: Covenant actor previously thanked fans for their love and support following the attack.

He said: ""Let me start by saying that I'm OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.

""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.""

""We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me. With Love, respect & honor...Jussie (sic)."""

The Jussie Smollett story seems to be quietly dying, but it shouldn't. New updates by Chicago police are giving way to the claims that Smollett's story has been a hoax all along. Police had asked to see Smollett's phone or his phone records immediately to verify his and his manager's account that they were on the phone with each other at the time of the attack. Smollett refused, saying he could not be without his phone for the length of time it would take for investigators to download his call log. Two weeks afterwards, on Tuesday, Smollett finally offered police a PDF file of his call log, which was heavily redacted. Police refused to use it as evidence, saying the computer file could easily have been edited and they need the information to come directly from the carrier instead. Jussie Smollett has still not complied with their request.

The most compelling development is the video surveillance of Smollett's steps that evening. Police have gathered and raked through hundreds of hours of footage and narrowed down that the attack supposedly happened in a 60-second time frame that happened to be off all cameras. No other persons are seen entering or leaving the same frames in that period of time. The ""persons of interest"" police have asked the public to help identify are seen sitting on a bench across the street at the time the assault is claimed to have happened. TMZ reported an interesting clue into the police thinking on Tuesday. The Chicago P.D. has confirmed that it has video of Jussie Smollett with the rope, tied in a Windsor knot, around his neck in the lobby of the building that he eventually called police from. Yet when a reporter asked if police also had video of Smollett with the rope around his neck outside that building, police said they could not confirm that, as it would ""interfere with the investigation."" If the rope was really around his neck before he entered the building, it wouldn't interfere. That was already assumed when Smollett declared that the rope was placed around his neck during the attack and he wore it until he reached his friend's apartment. Failure to confirm the actor's own statement indicates that he could have placed the mass-produced clothesline around his own neck upon entering the building. That could be the key to whether the entire crime was manufactured. The police aren't the only ones casting doubt on Jussie Smollett's story. Neighbors from the area in which he claims he was attacked have come forward, saying they have doubts about Smollett's description of the events as well. Agin Muhammed told reporters, ""I've been in this neighborhood five years. I don't believe it, not around here[.] ... Half the people are gay and the other half are black[.]"" Law enforcement confirm that if this is a hoax, they will charge Smollett with filing a false police report. It is much harder to prove that a crime has been fabricated than it is to say they can't find evidence of the crime. The absence of video evidence of the assault and Smollett withholding his phone records are not enough to convince a states attorney that he has committed a crime. Basically, he would have to confess, as hundreds of others who have claimed false hate crimes have done in the past. Mr. Smollett is unlikely to do so, but he is feeling the pressure. Smollett has just hired Harvey Weinstein's public relations team, Sunshine Sachs. The firm is clearly effective at its job, since we barely hear about Harvey Weinstein anymore. Perhaps Jussie should hire a lawyer next; I don't recommend Michael Avenatti. Perhaps life imitates art and could give insight into Smollett's ulterior motives. His own music video that he performed in and directed in March of 2017 called ""F.U.W."" has the imagery of a black man standing under a noose. Right after appears a man in a Donald Trump mask standing behind the TV actor. The song and accompanying music video are essentially just liberal porn and a manifestation of Smollett's personal deep fears of President Trump. Even if this all turns out be a hoax, so much time has passed that it doesn't matter. Thanks to just the accusation, the narrative that MAGA-supporters are evil, violent racists has already been written in stone — and in too many opinion pieces. Liberals would rather believe that Trump-supporters are lurking on Chicago streets at 2 A.M. in subzero temperatures, waiting to commit hate crimes, than that one person is breaking the law to perpetuate his own misguided ideas. A single tale, since that's all this is, can be used to justify actual violence against Trump-supporters. Police have subpoenaed Jussie Smollett's phone records and are still investigating. One thing is certain: a hate crime hoax will not get the same coverage by the mainstream media as an alleged hate crime. Connect with Taylor Day on Facebook and Twitter."

MUNCY, Pa. (AP) — A woman who survived a bear attack outside her Pennsylvania home has been released from the hospital and says she feels lucky to have survived. Fifty-year-old Melinda LeBarron told PennLive.com by phone from her Muncy-area home Tuesday that she “shouldn’t even be here.” LeBarron was released last week from Geisinger Medical Center, where she was taken with head, hip and shoulder injuries after the Dec. 12 attack.

LeBarron said the bear attacked after her dog began to bark. It took her down quickly, bit her and rolled her nearly 90 yards (meters). Wildlife officials think the bear might have been a sow with cubs.

LeBarron managed to drag herself home and spent two weeks in the trauma unit in critical condition. The dog was also attacked but has recovered.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Bill Cosby says he “will never have remorse” for the sexual encounter that sent him to prison because he considers his conviction the work of “a low-life district attorney and a corrupt judge.”

Cosby’s stance could leave him to serve the high end of a three- to 10-year prison term since sex offenders often must show remorse to win parole.

Spokesman Andrew Wyatt says Cosby is prepared to stay in prison rather than apologize for a 2004 encounter he considers consensual. Cosby in a statement calls himself a political prisoner in keeping with Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. Spokesman Andrew Wyatt says the legally blind, 81-year-old actor dictated the statement for NBC-TV to his wife Camille during a phone call Tuesday night from a suburban Philadelphia prison.

BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) — A Connecticut judge has ruled that Infowars host Alex Jones must undergo a sworn deposition in the defamation case brought against him by family members of Sandy Hook school shooting victims. Discussions on Jones’ web show have called the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre a hoax, and lawsuits by families of eight victims and a first responder say they’ve been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones’ followers.

The superior court judge also ruled yesterday that the families can depose several other defendants in the case, including those critical to Infowars’ business operations. Jones has defended the discussions on his show and says he too has cited First Amendment rights.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The mall outside Copenhagen, Denmark, that took down a wax statue of Michael Jackson has reversed the decision. The manager of the Roedovre (ROH’-dohv) Centrum Mall says it was an “overreaction” to remove the statue because Jackson has never been found guilty of any accusations against him. The mall had gotten about 15 complaints about the statue, which was part of an exhibit of famous people. The mall initially removed it to keep from offending anyone or setting it up to be vandalized. It was back in place yesterday.

NEW YORK (AP) — Joel Embiid has been fined $25,000 by the NBA for public criticism of referees that included profanity. The penalty was announced Wednesday by Kiki VanDeWeghe, the NBA’s executive vice president of basketball operations. Embiid’s comments came at the end of his postgame interview following Philadelphia’s 112-109 home loss to Boston on Tuesday.

CHICAGO (AP) — Actor Jussie Smollett says he’s mad that some have doubted his claims about being attacked outside his Chicago apartment last month. The actor who stars in the Fox drama “Empire” made the comments during an interview with ABC News that’s set to air Thursday on “Good Morning America.” A preview clip from the interview was posted online Wednesday.

Smollett says he was attacked Jan. 29 by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. Chicago police have made no arrests and said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack.

The 36-year-old Smollett, who is black and openly gay, tells ABC News that he wonders how people could doubt him, adding that what he reported was the truth.

Hardaway', 'May.', 'Michael Donahue', 'Chris Mccoy', 'Frank Murtaugh', 'Alex Greene']",https://www.memphisflyer.com/binary/f070/fly_02_14_19_01_p.jpg,"['views', 'school', 'religious', 'yearbook', 'pences', 'state', 'gay', 'pence', 'washington', 'men']","I have a question for those Republicans who, along with Democrats, demand the resignation of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam for the abhorrent photo that appeared on his page in his medical school yearbook: If bigotry is repugnant, why not demand the resignation of Vice President Pence for his ugly views on homosexuality? And while they're at it, why not insist that Pence's wife Karen resign her position at a school that discriminates against gays and lesbians?

I can guess their answer: The Pences are deeply religious, and their views on homosexuality are based on their religious convictions. To this, I say, so what? The Bible was used to justify slavery, and in my own time, racists cited this or that biblical passage to assert that racial segregation was precisely what God intended — the ""curse of Ham"" or the ""mark of Cain,"" both used to add biblical authority to the rantings of bigots. The mark or the curse is now on the Pences, who share views that in our nation's history have caused much suffering, including violence.

The other thing Republicans would be sure to say is that racism is different than ""mere"" anti-gay bias. Yes, indeed. Richmond was the capital of the Confederacy. Virginia is the state that once led the nation in number of slaves. The inhumanity of slavery is difficult to fathom. It's more difficult still to comprehend that great men — Washington, Jefferson, Madison ... you know the names — not only condoned it, but benefited from it.

Later came slavery's progeny — the Jim Crow era. I am talking of everything from the absurdity of segregated state parks to the barbarity of lynchings. In Atlanta in 1899, a black man was mutilated and then burned, with portions of his body distributed among the crowd. The man's name was Sam Hose. He was probably innocent of murder but not, of course, of being black.

The destructive power of blackface and Ku Klux Klan robes in that yearbook picture cannot be underestimated. But let's ponder, too, the harm of hateful homophobia. It has taken countless lives over the years, caused huge suffering and, like racism, persists to this day.

Homophobia is a staple of the racist right — Nazis, white nationalists, and other adherents of mindless goonery — and, at times, results in the murder of gay and transgender people. In 2017, 20 gay, bisexual, or queer men were murdered in hate crimes, an increase of 400 percent from the previous year. The problem is hardly going away. And, infamously, in 1998, Matthew Shepard, was beaten, tortured, and left to die because he was gay. Last year, his ashes were interred at Washington National Cathedral in a ceremony presided over by a gay Episcopal bishop, with music provided by the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington.

And when racial hatred and homophobia are combined, the results can be particularly disturbing. Last week, singer and actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two men who allegedly yelled anti-gay and anti-black epithets.

Pence has long been criticized as being hostile toward LGBTQ issues. He has linked same-sex couples to a ""societal collapse"" and even once seemed to support conversion therapy, which is a form of torture. A vice president who has expressed such intolerance is a dangerous model.

In certain corners of the right-wing media, criticism of Karen Pence for recently taking a job at the Immanuel Christian School in Springfield was denounced as nothing less than religious bigotry. After all, the argument went, the school is a Christian school, ultraconservative and ultratraditional, and is entitled to teach according to its deeply held beliefs. No doubt. But while the United States has traditionally given religion wide berth — and still does — lines have been drawn. Utah was not admitted as a state until the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints renounced polygamy.

No one is advocating a law requiring Immanuel Christian to practice tolerance, either in its pedagogy or its hiring practices. But the First Amendment that guarantees the school's rights also gives us the right to criticize. It is simply wrong to foster a belief that homosexuality and same-sex marriage are immoral.

I have been torn about Northam — about whether a single yearbook photo negates a lifetime of tolerance. But I am not torn about Mike and Karen Pence. They are figures of consequence, and their bigotry — regardless of their religious justification — has to be confronted.

Jussie Smollett is ""p***ed off"" that people don't believe the ""truth"" about him being attacked in a racist and homophobic assault last month.

The 'Empire' actor was subjected to a ""possible hate crime"" last month when two assailants allegedly hurled homophobic abuse before punching him, pouring an unknown chemical substance over him and putting a rope around his neck, and not only is he still angry about what happened to him, he's also annoyed that there have been so many false rumours surrounding the incident.

Speaking out for the first time in a preview of his upcoming interview on 'Good Morning America', he said: ""I'm p***ed off.""





Asked why by host Robin Roberts, he replied: ""It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks. It's not that you don't believe this is the truth; you don't want to see this is the truth.





""It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, because it's the truth.' Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you -- how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' ""









Earlier this week, a spokesperson for the 36-year-old star - who was on the phone to his manager at the time of the attack - defended Jussie after it was claimed he had turned over his phone records to police but they were limited and heavily redacted and so did not ""meet the burden for a criminal investigation"".





However, the actor's representative insisted he had been as co-operative as possible.





They said in a statement: ""Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.





""Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim.





""We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie's attackers and bring them to justice.""





""Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.""





Jussie returned to public life on February 2, where he told fans at a concert at Hollywood's Troubadour club that he had ""not fully healed yet"" and was still suffering with bruised ribs.





The 'Alien: Covenant' actor previously thanked fans for their ""love and support"" following the attack.





He said: ""Let me start by saying that I'm OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you.





""The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.





""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.





""As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.





I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.





""We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.





""Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - Actor Jussie Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his statement that he was attacked outside his Chicago apartment in January.

Being black and queer in a predominantly white community is the moment when those who identify as that are aware the most about their identity.

Three Pride members and an adviser of the organization talked about being black and queer in society today at the Black Queer Lives Matter panel discussion that was on the 7th Street Underground Wednesday night.

Dontae Milner, a Pride member, said he does not really think about being out in public as much because he can also pass as a straight black male.

He said when he is more aware of his surroundings it is in Mattoon, but he is only there for a short period of time.

Tiana Webb, who identifies as queer, said when she is on campus she feels students are very accepting.

Although during a summer term, Webb said it was a different experience to the point where she felt unsafe and it made her become aware of her surroundings.

“A lot of stares from people. A lot of confederate flags,” Webb said. “It was (at the point of) just being very uncomfortable with it and unsure.”

Yolanda Williams, the academic adviser of Pride, said it was very important for her to be open about being a lesbian to get other people to have someone to identify with them and normalize what their life is.

“I know there is people who struggle coming out, and I don’t push them, but when I meet other black gay professionals and they ask why did I chose to be out is because I work with students,” Yolanda Williams said.

Yolanda Williams said she does not want students to suffer and face these challenges of coming out alone.

She said when she was coming out in her late 20s, there was no public figure to look up to, as there is know in the media.

Jovan Williams, the vice president of Pride, said his experience of coming out was in two stories, one to his adopted parents and one to his birth father.

He said both were very accepting of him and were just waiting on him to tell them.

Yolanda Williams said she came out to her white gay friends first, because she said it was harder to tell her black friends and sorority.

Jussie Smollett, the “Empire” gay actor who was attacked in Chicago by two offenders who yelled homophobic and racial slurs, was also asked what the panelist thought of him being accused of faking the assault.

Yolanda Williams said she found it really sad that in 2019 people are thinking something that horrific could be faked.

“We see that on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, we see these incidents of black people, queer people being killed and bashed literally killed and bashed,” Yolanda Williams said.

A new rumor suggests two live-action Alien series are coming to Hulu from Ridley Scott.

Disney is set to acquire the Alien rights when the Fox merger closes later this year. The film franchise currently up in the air with Covenant‘s disappointing box office and reviews. Director Ridley Scott has talked about plans for a sequel titled, Awakening, but the film has no release date at this time. However, James Cameron did tease movement on the project from District 9 director Neil Blomkamp. The film is said to only be a sequel to the first two films in the vein of Halloween and Terminator: Dark Fate.

In December, the official social media page started shared cryptic possibly teasing franchise plans. HN Entertainment reports two live-action Alien series are in the works for Hulu. Ridley Scott is also set to executive produce the potential series.

Would you be excited about a Hulu series? Sound off in the comments below!

Here is the synopsis for Alien Covenant:

Ridley Scott returns to the universe he created, with ALIEN: COVENANT, a new chapter in his groundbreaking ALIEN franchise. The crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, discovers what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world. When they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape.

Directed by Ridley Scott from a script written by John Logan and Dante Harper, the film stars Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Demián Bichir, Carmen Ejogo, Amy Seimetz, Jussie Smollett, Callie Hernandez, Nathaniel Dean, Alexander England, and Benjamin Rigby.

Effectively proving that the liberal media reports about them were smears and lies, all three broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) and principal Spanish-language networks (Telemundo and Univision) omitted the findings from their evening reports.

Just before the 3:00 p.m. hour of CNN Newsroom began, host Brooke Baldwin came back from a commercial break with the news that was “just in.” “The students involved in that high profile encounter while attending last month’s March for Life rally in Washington have been exonerated,” she declared as if they were accused and on trial for an actual crime.

She added: “The Diocese of Covington says an independent investigation found that the students at Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky did not instigate that incident.”

A poorly timed cough made it seem as though Baldwin could barely bring herself to speak the truth about the Covington Kids: “Investigators also concluded that the students did not chant ‘build the wall’ and never – [cough] excuse me – never responded to the Black Hebrew Israelites with racist or offensive statements.” Ironic.

As if to suggest it was a grain of salt against the investigation, Baldwin noted that “[i]nvestigators say they didn't speak with the young man at the center of the whole thing,” as if Nick Sandmann was some kind of ringleader. But she did admit that investigators could not get a hold of serial liar Nathan Philips for questioning.

At about the same time the evening network programs were on the air, PBS NewsHour and anchor Judy Woodruff shared some of the investigation’s findings with viewers:

An investigation has found that no evidence that Catholic school students used racist or offensive language in an incident at the Lincoln Memorial. The encounter last month involved teenagers from a school in Covington, Kentucky, and Native American activists. Videos of it quickly went viral. The investigation was done for the Catholic Diocese of Covington.

Instead of reporting on the Covington Kids being vindicated, ABC’s World News Tonight gave more airtime to Empire star Jussie Smollett despite the continued absence of evidence he was assaulted. Unironically, NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt boasted about being in Washington, D.C. to promote fact-checking at Woodrow Wilson High School. NBC also touted the results of the Westminster Dog Show.

The transcripts are below:

Investigators also concluded that the students did not chant “build the wall” and never – [cough] excuse me -- never responded to the Black Hebrew Israelites with racist or offensive statements. Investigators say they didn't speak with the young man at the center of the whole thing and that they made several attempts to contact the Native American elder who said he felt threatened but never got a response."

""It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks,"" said Smollett, who's black and openly gay. ""It's not that you don't believe this is the truth; you don't even want to see this is the truth.""

He also said he believes that he would have been taken more seriously if his attackers were Muslim or minorities.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would’ve supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now,” he said.

The latest:Jussie Smollett: Chicago police have 'no evidence' attack was hoax, Fox supports actor

As for the motivation behind his attack, Smollett guessed it could be attributed to his opposition of President Donald Trump, saying, “I can only go off of their words.""

Smollett told Roberts he gets “threatened all the time” through social media, acknowledging he is ""sometimes maybe too outspoken, but it’s who I am.”

Smollett also provided more details on the threatening letter he received at Fox's Chicago studio, which is being investigated by the FBI.

He said he believes the letter is linked to his assault ""because on the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing towards it with the words that said 'Smollett, Jussie you will die,' "" he said, adding that the return address was simply listed as ""MAGA.""

The 36-year-old also recounted details of the attack, which the Chicago Police Department is investigating as a ""possible"" hate crime, explaining he was on a food run when he heard someone trying to get his attention.

“I heard ‘Empire,' and I don’t answer to 'Empire.' My name ain’t 'Empire,' and I didn’t answer,"" he said. ""I kept walking, and then I heard ""(Homophobic slur) 'Empire' (N-word).' So, I turned around and I said, '(What) the (expletive) did you just say to me?'

""And I see the attacker, masked and he said, 'This MAGA country, (N-word).' Punches me right in the face,"" Smollett continued. ""So I punched his (expletive) back. And then we started tussling and it was very icy.

""We ended up tussling by the stairs, fighting, fighting, fighting,"" Smollett added. ""There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back, and then it just stopped. And they ran off.”

Though Smollett estimates the attack could’ve lasted maybe 30 seconds, he said he was unsure of how long it actually went on.

“I noticed the rope around my neck, and I started screaming,"" he told Roberts. ""I said, 'There’s a (expletive) rope about my neck.' ""

Due to the nature of the attack, Smollett says he does not have much in the way of descriptions of his assailants.

""I can’t tell you what color their eyes were, and I did not see anything except the second person I saw running away,"" he said. ""And the first person, I saw his stature. I gave the description as best as I could.

""You have to understand also that it’s Chicago, in winter,"" he said. ""People can wear ski masks and nobody’s going to question that.""

The prospect of his attackers not being brought to justice brought Smollett to tears.

“I was talking to a friend and I said, ‘I just want them to find them.’ And she said, ‘Sweetie, they’re not going to find them,’ "" he said. ""That just made me so angry because (that means) I’m just gonna be left here with this?“

“They get to go free and go about their life and possibly attack someone else, and I’m here, left with the aftermath of this bull?"" Smollett said. ""That not cool to me, that’s not OK.

""So, I understand how difficult it will be to find them,"" he added, ""but we gotta. I still want to believe, with everything that has happened, that there’s something called justice.”

Thursday afternoon, Chicago Police's Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted investigators had identified people of interest. They are the two males seen in surveillance images released by authorities last month, Guglielmi informed The Associated Press.

""The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported,"" his second tweet read. ""They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.""

The story Smollett told Roberts matches the account in his police report, filed in the early hours of Jan. 29. Later that day, Guglielmi told USA TODAY that Smollett was approached in the early hours of the morning by two people who ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" adding that they punched him in the face, poured a chemical on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett made his initial public statement about the attack on Feb. 1, he expressed concern with how his case was being reported in the media.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

On Tuesday, Chicago Police Sgt. Rocco Alioto told USA TODAY that Smollett's submitted phone records from the night of the incident ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted.""

During his ""GMA"" interview, Smollett addressed his initial refusal to give his phone to authorities, which he said was due to concern for his privacy.

“Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers,"" he explained, noting his phone contains ""my partner’s number, my (family members numbers), my castmates' numbers, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

Smollett also said the experience has permanently altered him, for better or worse.

He told Roberts, ""I will never be the man this did not happen to. I am forever changed, and I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us – good and bad.""

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” Smollett said in an excerpt from the interview made available Wednesday. “Never did.”

As TheWrap first reported, Roberts landed the first interview with the “Empire” star since reported being attacked in Chicago while walking to his apartment. According to Smollett, two men attacked him while yelling racial and homophobic slurs and referencing “MAGA.” A police statement said unspecified chemicals were poured on the “Empire” star’s face, and a rope placed around his neck.

A day after the incident, police released images of two “potential persons of interest” taken from a surveillance video.

The photos showed two silhouettes walking in the area of where Smollett was sometime between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m., but did not show any attack. Chicago police said they would like question the two people.

Asked why he was convinced those were his attackers, Smollett told Roberts, “I was there,” adding, “For me, when that was released, I was like, O.K., we’re getting somewhere.”

In the clip, Smollett also said he was “pissed off” at what he called “attacks” from those who may have doubted his account.

“What is it that has you so angry? Is it the…attackers?” Roberts asked.

“Attackers, but it’s also the attacks,” Smollett responded. “It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ’cause it’s the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you- how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.'”

Police had asked for Smollett’s phone records because he said he was on a call with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, during the attack. After Smollett turned the records over, Chicago police said they were too heavily redacted to be useful to their investigation. A Chicago police spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said in a statement, “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

On Tuesday, Smollett’s publicists pushed back, saying that the actor was only trying to protect “the privacy of personal contacts.”

For the first time, revealing what he saw in that grainy surveillance image of two people police say were spotted nearby around the time of the attack. The police have gone through a lot of video and they were able to capture an image of two people of interest. Have you seen that image? And do you believe they could possibly be the attackers? I do. Reporter: What is it about their -- their size or what -- why do you feel that they could possibly be? Because I -- I was there.

Smollett also gave a tearful statement to Good Morning America, which will air Thursday morning.

Chicago Police told media on Monday that Smollett provided a series of phone records to authorities in order to prove that he was on the phone with his manager during the attack. But TMZ reports that the phone “records” were actually just “a redacted, PDF print-out of a bill” and that police believe the print-outs were insufficient to substantiate Smollett’s claims of the attack.

Chris Bastardi, the “Vice President/Head of Strategy and Crisis for Sunshine Sachs” issued an official statement on behalf of Smollett Wednesday morning, answering concerns that Smollett may not have provided adequate information to Chicago authorities.

“The following is a statement from Chris Bastardi, he is the Vice President/Head of Strategy and Crisis for Sunshine Sachs, the firm representing Jussie Smollett,” ABC7 reporter Rob Elgas tweeted.

“Sunshine Sachs firm on Smollett phone records: ‘Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police. Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police,'” Elgas continued.

“MORE: Sunshine Sachs firm: ‘Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim,'” Elgas added.

“We are continuing to work closely with Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice. Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” the PR firm said, according to Elgas.

Finally, Elgas notes, “Firm Sunshine Sachs representing Jussie Smollett: ‘Police have not told us that they are rejecting any records, nor have they expressed concerns about the records to us. Therefore, we don’t feel compelled to be bated into responding to uncorroborated press reports.'”

The statement, of course, carefully avoids the TMZ report’s specific language, which claims Chicago Police merely found the reports unhelpful in their investigation, not incorrect, rejected, or concerning.

Researcher Chadwick Moore connected the firm, Sunshine Sachs, to Harvey Weinstein, who hired the firm to help defend him amid claims that he sexually assaulted multiple women.

As part of his sudden PR blitz, Smollett will appear on Good Morning America on Thursday in a pre-recorded interview with Robin Roberts. In promos for the interview, Smollett is seen crying, and pleads with the public to believe his story of being assaulted by two men who screamed racial slurs, referenced “MAGA country” and wounded Smollett.

“I’m p****d off. It’s the attackers but it’s also the attacks. At first it was a thing of like, listen if I tell the truth then that’s it cause it’s the truth,” Smollett says in a promotional clip that aired on Wednesday. “Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that. It’s the truth.'”

“And then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh. It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth,'” he added, apparently hitting out at critics who say his story doesn’t add up — critics who now include some of his neighbors, according to TMZ."

“I’m pissed off…It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks,” Jussie Smollett told ABC Good Morning America host Robin Roberts.

He continued, “It’s like, you know, at first it was a thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then, that’s it, because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, oh, how can you doubt that?”

“Like, how can you not believe that? It’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.”

The actor also cries at one point in the interview.

Smollett, who stars in the FOX television show Empire, made national headlines last month for claiming to be attacked by two individuals in downtown Chicago at around 2 a.m. He claimed that his attackers, who were wearing masks and gloves, threw a chemical on him, put a rope around his neck, beat him, and hurled racial and homophobic slurs, and yelling, “This is MAGA country!”

Chicago police reviewed hundreds of hours of video and still have not found any possible suspects in the alleged attack.

In a statement this week, Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that phone records from Smollett, “do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted.”

The full interview with Smollett will air on ABC Thursday morning."

CHICAGO (AP) — Actor Jussie Smollett says he’s “pissed off” that some have doubted his claims about being attacked outside his Chicago apartment last month.

The actor who stars in the Fox drama “Empire” made the comments during an interview with ABC News that’s set to air Thursday on “Good Morning America.” A preview clip from the interview was posted online Wednesday.

Smollett says he was attacked Jan. 29 by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. Chicago police have made no arrests and said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack.

The 36-year-old Smollett, who is black and openly gay, tells ABC News that he wonders how people could doubt him, adding that what he reported was the truth."

""It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it,' 'cause it's the truth. Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you -- how do you not believe that? It's the truth,'"" he said.

""And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

Smollett, 36, plays a gay man on the Fox series Empire, and came out as gay himself in 2015.

Since the attack, Smollett has mostly stayed out of the public eye, stepping out only once to perform at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on February 2.

""I'm not fully healed yet...but I'm going to be, and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all,"" he told the crowd at the Troubadour.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those [expletive] win,"" he added.

""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope that you all stand with me."""
