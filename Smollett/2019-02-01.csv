School administrators reported that the teacher, who was subbing for a technology class at at Hickory Hills Elementary and Middle School, made comments towards two Black eighth grad students that were “disturbing, unacceptable, and are completely at odds with who we are a school district,” said Stephen Hall, chief communications officer for Springfield Public Schools.

A mother of one of the students, Jean Hawkins, told the Springfield News-Leader that when her son entered the class on that Wednesday morning, he was met with threatening remarks by the substitute educator.

“The teacher tells them, ‘I was told to shoot you black boys. You black boys are nothing but trouble,’” Hawkins told the outlet. “[My son] just looked at [the teacher] and he couldn’t believe what he was saying. He was like, ‘Wow.’ He didn’t know if he should run.”

Although the two students were too stunned to leave and report the incident, another student did, Hawkins said.

“He doesn’t know who told,” Hawkins explained. The substitute teacher was immediately escorted off the school’s campus.

“There is zero tolerance for any comment like those described. SPS remains committed to ensuring that all of our students thrive in a learning environment where they feel safe, welcomed and respected,” Hall told Yahoo Lifestyle.

“Because of that commitment and our refusal to accept any behavior that fails to meet those standards, we can confirm that this individual was removed from the list of eligible SPS substitutes, on the same day the allegations were made, and will not return to SPS in any capacity.”

The staffing agency that hired the sub, Penmac Education Staffing, said they are taking the allegations “very seriously” and released a statement.

“We have no tolerance for such behavior,” a spokesperson tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “The substitute in question is suspended from all assignments, pending the completion of a full investigation. We are cooperating fully with Springfield Public Schools in the completion of that investigation.”

Hawkins wants the name of the sub, which has not been released and she has filed a complaint with the staffing agency, Penmac.

“We remain in contact with the parents of the students involved. That communication began on the day the incident occurred,” Hall explained to the outlet. “Our ongoing commitment is to both listen to their concerns and to explain the steps we have taken to address the situation thoroughly and promptly.”

Smollett's attackers allegedly hit the actor, placed a rope around his neck, poured an unidentified substance on him and yelled homophobic and racial slurs at him, Chicago police said.

Police have not seen video of the confrontation but say they viewed security footage showing Smollett with a rope draped around his neck.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100 per cent factual and consistent on every level,"" Smollett said in his statement.

""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Officials released an image on Wednesday showing two persons of interest in the case.

Police have not identified any suspects, and no arrests have been made.

The new remarks from Smollett, who came out as gay in 2015, follow his family's statement one day earlier calling the attack a ""racial and homophobic hate crime"".

Smollett said in his statement, ""As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.

""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.""

He said he will further address the situation after taking a moment to process it."

After touching on climate change, Page moved on to an impassioned speech about LGBT discrimination. In the three-minute run, she uses this week's attack against Empire star Jussie Smollett as a point of reference. (The bulk of Page's speech begins at 6:54.)

This content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

According to Smollett's statement, the attack occurred early Tuesday morning in Chicago when two men allegedly poured bleach on him, wrapped a rope around his neck, and said, ""This is MAGA country."" After touching on what happened to Smollett this week, Page blasted Vice President Mike Pence's track record with the LGBT community—specifically his anti-LGBT measures he made during his tenure as Governor of Indiana. She then pointed out the flaws in the media's LGBT reporting and how it encouraged a debate over the veracity of Smollett's claims, saying, ""This shit isn't a debate."" It's a lot to digest in three minutes, but once it's said and done, there's only one thing to say: she's right.

Page, who came out in 2014, explained that attacks like that on Smollett aren't random. It's a symptom of a hateful nation. The hatred that queer people face is exhausting—you can see the fatigue on Page's face as she speaks in the Late Show clip. Meanwhile, the president stayed quiet regarding Smollett's attack until Thursday, when he broke his silence to say, ""I've seen it—last night. I think that's horrible. It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned."" (He then used Smollett's attack to transition into his typical anti-immigration talking points.) There was no mention of the attackers' alleged use of his campaign slogan or homophobic and racist language. Just that it—the ambiguously convenient ""it""—is horrible.

The point is clear, though. Ellen Page knows it. I know it. And you know it.

The runaround from the White House is more proof that these attacks aren't worthy of reprimanding. Skepticism surrounding Smollett's statement reinforces the lack of respect we give victims and people of color. But more than the responses, the attack on Smollett did double-duty. It serves as a reminder to both people of color and the LGBT community that our current America isn't for them. Pence's history and Trump's irreverence for marginalized communities sends a message that his base wants to hear: the American Dream is for white, heterosexual men. And make no mistake, as Page points out earlier in her speech; the fact that Smollett is a black gay man matters. If being a queer person in Trump's America is damning, then being a queer person of color in Trump's America is more icing on the hate-filled cake.

If being a queer person in Trump's America is damning, then being a queer person of color in Trump's America is more icing on the hate-filled cake.

What makes Page's speech and this week's news cycle so incredibly exhausting is that this week's act of violence doesn't come from a marginalized person attempting to oppress someone else. It's the result of a black gay man's attempt to exist in America. And say, for the sake of the conversation, Smollett's claim isn't true and Trump had denounced the attack as the hate crime it is; the only ramification would be that the leader of one of the world's most powerful countries used his platform to denounce violence against black and LGBT people.

But that message isn't on the agenda. Any statement from Trump or Pence or the White House denouncing hate crimes would go against a well-established precedent: Those in power are entitled to abuse people who don't look or live the same way they do at their discretion.

If you're white and straight and cisgender and male, and you feel uncomfortable with this analysis, welcome. That nauseous feeling you may have is one that a lot of Americans carry with them every day. The further a person gets from the above description, the more the truth rings clear to them: This is absolutely MAGA country. The power to change that fact has never belonged to people of color or queer people. It belongs to the people who best fit the description above, no matter your political party. And if you're not recognizing that power, your silence speaks just as loudly that which comes from the executive office.

Hart, who famously tried to get onstage after his home team the Eagles won last year, is still rooting for them!

He told ""Extra's"" AJ Calloway, “The Eagles didn’t make it this year, but we’re here… I’m rooting for the Eagles.”

Kevin was joined by The Plastic Cup Boys for his Sirius XM “Straight from the Heart” show. Kevin pointed out, “It ain’t about me, it’s about embracing who you got behind you. My radio show doesn’t work without my brothers.”

On a more serious note, Kevin said, ""It's authentic conversations. We engage, but we do it differently.”

Speaking out on what happened to “Empire” star Jussie Smollett, who reported being the victim of a hate crime this week, Kevin said, “In a time like this, you just have to be open in making people aware that hate crimes shouldn’t be accepted. Not only should not be accepted, accepting people for who they are is what we are and what we should do.”

Hart communicated with Smollett and ""Empire"" creator Lee Daniels, saying, “I openly had a conversation with him and with Lee, and I’m here, I’m fully supportive of him and whatever he needs at this time. More importantly, making people understand this is not what we are and what our country should be doing, not at this time.”

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven't found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven't found video of the attack, Smollett has been ""very co-operative and we have no reason at this point to think he's not being genuine with us.""

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn't be unusual that such an attack wouldn't be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn't provide full coverage, police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don't continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

""Somewhere out there there's a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,"" he said, pointing out that the two aren't considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBT issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBT survivors of violence."

Actor Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on Empire, has broken his silence after two men reportedly beat him up and shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him in Chicago.

On Friday, Feb. 1, 2019, Smollett released a statement, commenting on being the recent victim of a brutal attack.

Feb 1, 2019 • Post A Comment

Actor Jussie Smollett, who has been the focus of a torrent of media attention since he was the apparent victim of an attack in Chicago earlier this week, commented for the first time about the incident.

The New York Times reports that Smollett’s publicist released a statement in which Smollett said: “Let me start by saying that I’m O.K. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

He also addressed theories that have circulated on social media suggesting his account of the incident may not have been accurate.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” he said. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

“Smollett, who is black and gay, had reported being attacked in Chicago by two men around 2 a.m. on Tuesday as he was heading back from a late meal to the apartment where he was staying,” The Times reports. “He said they were wearing masks and yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured some kind of substance on him and put a noose around his neck before fleeing. He was briefly treated at a hospital for cuts on his face and neck.”

The report adds: “A spokesman for the Chicago Police, who are treating the case as a possible hate crime, said that investigators had found video of Smollett entering the apartment building with some sort of rope around his neck resembling a noose. On Wednesday, the police said they were searching for two ‘potential persons of interest’ spotted on a surveillance camera in the area where Smollett said the attack occurred. So far, the two people have not been identified.”

Smollett is one of the stars of the Fox drama series “Empire,” which has been filming in Chicago."

Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images(CHICAGO) — Three days after he told police that he was attacked in a possible hate crime in Chicago, Jussie Smollett thanked his fans Friday and assured them that he was on his way to recovery, both mentally and physically.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” the 36-year-old “Empire” actor said in the statement to ABC News. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

ESSENCE Magazine first reported Smollett’s statement.

And though Chicago Police have told ABC News that Smollett is only being viewed as the victim in this investigation, the actor is still bothered by some chatter online that his story may have changed in any way. Police also revealed video grabs earlier this week of two men that they hope to question about the incident.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in the statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the department was taking the case as seriously as it does any crime, but called Smollett a “victim” and said he’s been “cooperative.”

“The allegations are horrendous, horrible and cowardly,” Johnson said, adding, without specifics, that detectives have made progress. “We have no reason to believe he has not been genuine.”

In his statement, Smollett said attacks like the one he described are “happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.”

“I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,” he added.

Smollett said that he will address the details of the attack soon, but needs a “moment to process.”

“Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love,” he said in the statement. “It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

The “Empire” star told police he was attacked early Tuesday. He was subsequently hospitalized and released, local authorities said.

Smollett told police that the men also allegedly poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, police said. The rope was still around Smollett’s neck when police spoke to him, officials said.

Smollett’s family also released a statement Thursday, saying he was the victim of a “violent and unprovoked attack.”

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,” the family wrote in the statement to ABC News. “Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

Chicago Police has told ABC News that a dozen detectives are pursuing new leads and have tracked the actor’s movements that morning through video and photos.

They said early Thursday that video shows Smollett walking across the street from two men, whose photos were released late Wednesday to the public. In the video, Smollett walks out of frame for about a minute and reappears on another camera “wearing a rope like a neck tie,” police said.

Gladnick', 'Contributing Writer']",https://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/smollett.jpg,"['reporter', 'smollett', 'share', 'hate', 'alleged', 'jussie', 'face', 'racism', 'proof', 'washpost', 'americans', 'accepts', 'crime', 'gay', 'scott', 'black']","Despite the fact that many parts of Jussie Smollett's alleged hate crime had already started to fall apart by the time the Washington Post ""identity politics"" reporter Eugene Scott wrote about it on Wednesday, he failed to mention any of this. Instead Scott just went ahead and accepted that the attack was exactly as described.

He used the Smottett story to allege racism and homophobia despite the lack of any real evidence so far in a piece headlined, ""The Jussie Smollett attack highlights the hate black gay Americans face.""

After “Empire” star Jussie Smollett was hospitalized early Tuesday after reportedly being attacked by two people who hurled slurs, black gay men took to social media and other outlets to share the challenges they face on a regular basis in this current political climate. ...And the story became political not long after news about Smollett, an activist who has spoken out against President Trump’s policies, broke. Multiple lawmakers took to social media to decry what happened. ...Smollett’s [ahem, alleged] experience is far too common for black gay men, particularly those who speak out against racism and sexism. As activist Preston Mitchum wrote: “Everyday our multiple marginalized identities increase our chances of facing racist, homophobic vitriol — and this fact has only intensified under the Trump administration with their dog whistle politics. So as we wait to see if justice is served for Smollett, we as Black queer people wait to see if America will finally see our lives as worth protecting. Because history has rarely been on the side of Black queer folk.”

Scott added ""These violent encounters are part of why so many black gay Americans were so critical of comedian Kevin Hart’s past homophobic jokes and his often defiant response to criticism of them shortly after he was named as this year’s Academy Awards host.""

He concluded by putting this right at the door of Donald Trump:

Trump is often criticized, even by supporters, for failing to denounce racism. And he has spoken out against homophobia even less....To many, the Smollett incident — and the political nature of the assault — is yet another reminder for many black gay Americans that this president’s vision of a “great America” does not appear to include them.

Yup, not a bit of doubt crept into Scott's story. Obviously, a hate crime. However, many sources are increasingly revealing a story that not only seems to be falling apart but also involves a coverup such as this Thursday report from NBC News, ""Chicago police say 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett refuses to hand over cellphone to them.""

CHICAGO — ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has refused to turn over his cellphone to detectives, who are investigating the alleged attack that sent him to the hospital earlier this week, Chicago police said Thursday. The actor declined to share telephone records that could show he was speaking with his manager just as the alleged assault happened early Tuesday morning in Chicago, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told NBC News.... The manager has told police he heard the attackers say, ""This is MAGA country,"" during the assault, officials said. When police asked Smollett for his cellphone and records to confirm the call, he refused to share them, according to Guglielmi.

So if you are the victim of a hate crime why would you not turn over evidence to help the police find the perps unless...

Exit question: If this alleged hate crime case completely collapses, will identity politics reporter Eugene Scott provide an update as to why his initial analyis was completely wrong?"

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed assertions levelled on social media that he has been less than co-operative and changed his story.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven’t found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support” he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it “horrible.” But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn’t co-operated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett’s refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven’t found video of the attack, Smollett has been “very co-operative and we have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.”

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn’t be unusual that such an attack wouldn’t be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn’t provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don’t continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

“Somewhere out there there’s a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,” he said, pointing out that the two aren’t considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence."

In an emotional interview on “The Late Show Stephen Colbert” Thursday night, the “Juno” actress told Colbert that it was hard to not be “fired up,” given the president and vice president’s outlook on LGBTQ issues.

“The Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana,” Page said.

Page, who identifies as gay, spoke of her wife of one year.

She suggested Pence’s beliefs and rhetoric contribute to the prejudice and violence many LGBTQ individuals face.

“Connect the dots,” Page said. “Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street.”

Page cited the reported attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who told police he was attacked by two men this week while they called him racist and homophobic slurs.

“This needs to f***ing stop,” Page concluded as she choked up. She was met with a large applause from the audience.

CNN has reached out to the vice president’s office for comment on Page’s statements, but has not heard back.

Pence is a conservative Christian, and while Governor of Indiana he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Critics of the law contend it could be used by individuals and businesses to discriminate — particularly against the community of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals — on the basis of religion.

His wife, Second Lady Karen Pence, recently came under fire for accepting a job as an art teacher at a private Christian school that bars LGBTQ students and employees.

At the time, Kara Brooks, Pence’s communications director, said the attention paid to the school’s agreement is “absurd.”

“Mrs. Pence has returned to the school where she previously taught for 12 years. It’s absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a Christian school, and the school’s religious beliefs, are under attack,” Brooks said in a statement to CNN. She did not answer when asked by CNN if Pence agreed with the policy."

Ellen Page was meant to promote her Netflix superhero show The Umbrella Academy in an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Thursday night. Instead, she called out US Vice President Mike Pence’s homophobia in an impassioned speech.

The segment started out with Colbert asking Page if Hollywood’s attitudes toward the LGBTQ community have gotten better.

Page, who hosted Gaycation on VICELAND, responded that while things have improved, “we need to hurry up. It’s not cutting it.”

She later segued an exchange about climate change into the media’s treatment of the recent beating of Empire star Jussie Smollett, who is gay and black. Smollett was attacked in downtown Chicago on Tuesday. Smollett said he was assaulted by two masked men who also tied a rope around his neck, while making racist and homophobic remarks. He said his attackers threw an unknown chemical on him.

“We have a media that’s saying it’s a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd. This shit isn’t a debate,” Page told Colbert, who said he agreed.

“I’m like really fired up tonight but it feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the president and the Vice President Mike Pence, who like wishes I couldn’t be married,” Page continued.

“Let’s just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.”

Page then said the public needs to “connect the dots” between homophobic people in power and attacks on individuals.

“If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, and you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street,” she said.

Page added she hopes Gaycation connected the dots for people.

“I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people. I am lucky to have this time and privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.”

Pence, who describes himself as a conservative Christian, has previously said gay marriage signifies the “societal collapse” and opposed the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, a military policy that forced US troops to remain in the closet.

According to the Sacramento Bee, Wednesday, the ACLU filed a suit in federal district court in Sacramento, arguing that Sheriff Jones violated the First Amendment rights of Black Lives Matter members leaders Tanya Faison and Sonia Lewis when he deleted comments they made on October 31st and November 5th.

In May 2018, deputies working in Jones’ department fatally shot Mikel McIntyre, a 32-year-old Black man suffering from mental and emotional disabilities.

During the incident which took place on the shoulder of Highway 50 in Sacramento, McIntyre reportedly threw a rock at one deputy, striking him in the head. As he began to run away from the scene he threw two more rocks; one hitting a police dog and another nicking a deputy on the leg.

After that, the unarmed and disabled man continued to flee until he was shot in the back and killed. Despite the fact that three deputies fired 28 shots at a man armed with nothing but a few pebbles, D.A. Anne Marie Schubert declined to press charges against the deputies.

The public was outraged by the excessive force they believe was used in the case against McIntyre. Sheriff Jones clearly saw nothing wrong with what his officers did, so much so that he even took to Facebook to gain support for them while bashing the local chapter of Black Lives Matter.

When Faison and Lewis went to the sheriff’s Facebook page to fact check his statements and provide a critical response, he deleted their comments and blocked them entirely.

“This attempt to silence us shows how little the sheriff values Black lives and the movement to combat injustice and inequality,” Faison said in a statement released by the ACLU. “It is our role to call public attention to state violence and racist policing whether the sheriff likes it or not.”

Sean Riordan, a senior staff attorney for the ACLU, says Jones “censored” Faison and Lewis on his official Facebook page because of the “content of their speech.”

“Sheriff Jones has attempted to stifle the voices of the leaders of Black Lives Matter Sacramento,” explains Riordan. “This is impermissible censorship that violates both the state and federal constitutions.”

The suit, which is seeking an unspecified amount of damages, also calls for an injunction requiring Jones to unblock Faison and Lewis from his official social media accounts."

In an exclusive statement to ESSENCE, the Empire star insists he’s been truthful about what occurred during the incident and expressed gratitude for all of the support.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett wrote. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you.

Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Initial reports claimed two men attacked him in the early hours of Tuesday (January 29) and threw bleach on him, put a noose around his throat and yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett has been accused of lying about the incident on social media. But according to TMZ, Chicago police have confirmed Smollett was seen with a rope around his neck in surveillance footage of his apartment building

Smollett’s family also issued a statement of their own on Instagram, vowing to stay committed to spreading love no matter how dire things get.

Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

And if you’re worried you might be one your self: worrying about work on a day off, feeling too busy to take a vacation, and checking emails in bed after waking up all number among the top signs of a “workaholic.”

In fact, it turns out, more than half of American office workers (58 percent) say they do indeed actually check their work email while still in bed after waking up.

A new study of 2,000 employed Americans aimed to unveil just how hard Americans work and found that 28 percent of “workaholic” Americans say they work so hard out of financial necessity.

The average employed American also works four hours a week for free, and if that’s not enough, the average employed American also spends an additional four hours a week just thinking about work.

Even while taking this survey, more than half (53 percent) of Americans said they were currently stressed out about work.

The survey, conducted by OnePoll on behalf of The Vision Council, also found that being chained to our desk all day may be having a serious effect on our eyes.

The amount of time we rack up staring at screens is pretty astonishing, with the average employed American saying they will spend seven and a half hours looking at a screen on an average day.

Amazingly, one in three (35 percent) employed Americans say they actually rack up over nine hours of screen time a day.

“The human eyes were not designed to look at digital devices — not to mention nearly as long as modern individuals do,” says Dr. Justin Bazan, practicing optometrist and medical adviser to The Vision Council.

“With Americans’ screen time hours nearing the double digits, and them spending their entire workdays — and more — on digital devices, it’s imperative that individuals take a serious look at the implications on the eyes, especially, as they’re the organs taking the brunt of all this screen time.”

So how does all this work and screen time affect our eyes?

According to the research, the average employed American will experience four eye-related pains/discomforts a day, with over three in four (78 percent) saying they would experience less if they didn’t have to stare at screens all day.

This echoes data uncovered from the VisionWatch survey, a study The Vision Council previously did, which found that many individuals suffer from physical discomfort after screen use for longer than two hours at a time.

They can experience anything from eye strain, to dry eyes, to headaches, to blurred vision, to neck and shoulder pain. The Vision Council refers to the collection of these symptoms as digital eye strain.

According to the VisionWatch study, 80 percent of American adults report using digital devices for more than two hours per day with nearly 67 percent using two or more devices simultaneously, and 59 percent report experiencing symptoms of digital eye strain.

And digital eye strain does appear to be a growing trend among Americans, as according to the VisionWatch study, 32 percent report experiencing eye strain, 27 percent report experiencing dry eyes, 28 percent say they have headaches, 28 percent say they experience blurred vision, and 35 percent even report neck and shoulder pain.

“The good news is there are eyewear solutions — glasses outfitted with traditional lenses with blue light and anti-reflective capabilities to combat blue light and glare, plus magnifications to help the eyes relax, as well as specialized contact lenses — available to help alleviate the symptoms of digital eye strain,” Bazan said.

Jimmy Hill, Atchison’s father and Tanya Miller, the attorney for the family, spoke out Friday on “The Clay Cane Show” on SiriusXM Urban View channel 126. Miller had a direct message for Mayor Bottoms:

“We are calling on a Keisha Lance Bottoms. We are calling on chief Erika Shields of the Atlanta Police Department,” Miller said. “We are calling on all law enforcement agencies in this community that are responsible to this community and are responsible for making sure that law enforcement uphold the law when they go into our communities.”

She continued, “We want to have a fair and transparent and thorough investigation. We want this family to be treated with dignity in the process. We do not expect to sit by idly and watch this thing to be silenced or deaded or to have his character assassinated. It’s really simple, this is Atlanta this is the birthplace of Martin Luther King. This is the city where African-Americans come here from other places in the country. This is the black mecca of the south. We expect that this very important issue of police brutality and the way that policing happens in African-American communities will be given the kind of treatment that we would expect from Atlanta by African-American community leaders who are responsible for this. We are calling on everybody, from the mayor to the police chief and everyone in between to come to the table to meet with this family and to talk about this very important issue community in our community.”

Coming up on the @claycane show, we will be talking to the father of Jimmy Atchison — a 21-year-old who was shot by police in Atl. You need to be aware of this story! #JimmyAtchison #claycaneshow Tune in ch. 126 @SXMUrbanView | 12-1P ET | 866-801-8255https://t.co/mxptzMp8Bz — SiriusXM Urban View (@SXMUrbanView) February 1, 2019

Jimmy Hill said his “was a wonderful young man. He was a caring man. He was a loving man. He loved his family. I tell people, if you would’ve just came to the service, you would’ve seen how many friends were devastated. He loved everybody… I just want people to know, I don’t care if you’re living on the street or if you are a top official — if Jimmy was your son would you want answers? Would you want justice?”

On Jan. 22, according to Miller, an officer entered an apartment complex in southwest Atlanta around 7 a.m. The police “came in with military assault-style rifles to execute a run-of-the-mill warrant for robbery.”

Atchinson had been accused of a robbery but Miller explained, “We still don’t know all the details behind that and it certainly is not in his character.”

Atchinson was in his girlfriend’s apartment before fleeing out of apparent fear. He then entered the apartment of a friend who also lived in the complex. Police found him hiding in the closet and, according to Miller, he was surrendering with his hands up and he had no weapon. Then he was shot in the face by the police.

Miller stressed, “There is no real good explanation for why he could not have been taken into custody alive.” The police have not confirmed if he was unarmed or not but all witness reportedly said he wasn’t. “They don’t want to come out and say that he was unarmed but the reason why you know he was armed is that if he was armed the first thing that they would have said in their press release is that he was armed.” She added, “Instead they’re being coy and they’re not answering the question on if he was armed. We have no answers from them in that regard.”

Miller says the officer’s name is Sung Kim. He has been suspended pending investigation “but we are hearing he is still coming to work on desk duty and accumulating the coveted Super Bowl overtime.”

Just a few days before Atchison’s death, an off-duty Atlanta police officer shot and killed D’Ettrick Griffin, 18.

A candlelight vigil has been planned for 7 p.m. Friday at city hall in Atlanta. Atchinson’s family, pastor and the NAACP representatives will all be in attendance. Listen to the full interview below with Jimmy Hill, Atchinson’s father, and the attorney.

Rest in power, Jimmy Atchinson.

Deadline

The calendar has turned to February, and that means the final stretch of this six-month awards season has begun — as if you couldn’t guess by the flurry of activity heating things up just as the outside temperature in many places is all about the big winter freeze. This weekend things really are jumping in terms of those sometimes-predictive guild awards shows. Tonight, the ACE Eddies hand out hardware for the best edited film and TV shows. Saturday is a free-for-all with the Art Directors Guild, the Annie Awards for animated contenders, Sundance giving a preview perhaps of next year handing out the best-of-fest honors and the really big event of the weekend, the DGA Awards, which have failed only seven times since their inception in 1948 to correctly predict the eventual directing Oscar winner.

Roma’s Alfonso Cuarón is heavily favored to win with the first foreign language film to take the Directors Guild’s top prize,(UPDATED: Clarifying Ang Lee won DGA for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in 2001 so Cuaron would be second DGA foreign language winner, however Lee lost Oscar to Steven Soderbergh and no director has won the Academy Award Directing category for a foreign language film and Cuaron would be the first). and it will be presented by another of the “three amigos”, Guillermo del Toro — who conveniently won this award last year for The Shape of Water. Should it happen, and it would be a major upset if it didn’t at this point — the DGA winner will have been one of those “three amigos” (the other being back-to-back winner Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárittu) five times in the past six years. when Cuarón kicked off this remarkable streak winning for 2013’s Gravity. (Damien Chazelle for La La Land was the only interloper to break up this Mexican stranglehold on the prize.) And of course, all of them went on to continue the same streak at the Oscars, and there is no reason to think this particular feat won’t repeat there too.

Thanks to online balloting, voting for the DGA honors is still continuing through today. This also is almost certain to be a ceremony where Bradley Cooper finally gets to make an acceptance speech, as he is heavily favored to win the First Time Feature Director award for A Star Is Born. He likely will get two speeches since nominees for the main prize also get to accept their Medallion commemorating that achievement (he’s up for that as well).

Meanwhile. heading up north, as usual this time of year, is a boatload of Oscar nominees who will be appearing on panels and at tributes at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The five Oscar-nominated directors did their thing last night, but there will be panels with writers, producers and women — nine female nominees, with Roma supporting actress nominee just added, will be front and center at the Lobero on Sunday morning for that sure-to-be compelling panel — taking center stage along with various career tributes and SBIFF awards to the likes of Glenn Close, Rami Malek, Melissa McCarthy and Viggo Mortensen. I will be hosting the latter on Saturday afternoon at the historic Arlington Theatre and can tell you the footage we will be showing is spectacular.

AMPAS

After all this flurry of activity, every one of these nominees will be back bright and early Monday at the Beverly Hilton for the annual Oscar Nominees Luncheon, where they all climb risers to get their class picture taken. If tradition holds, we will get our first taste of what the Oscar show is going to look like, and maybe finally confirmation by the Academy that the no-host bar at the Dolby also will extend to the stage this year. The Academy has been mum, and producer Donna Gigliotti and co-producer Glenn Weiss have spoken nary a word so far. The org finally confirmed Thursday that Jennifer Hudson will be performing “I’ll Fight” from RBG, and all five Best Song nominees will be sung live, obviously a move to tamp down rumors last week that only two of the five nominated songs (from Black Panther and A Star Is Born) would be on the show.

Usually the producer takes the stage at this annual lunch to, at the very least, tell the gathered nominees to keep their acceptance speeches short and sincere. Maybe we will get word on which categories the Academy will be presenting during commercial breaks and then rolled in later into the show in edited fashion, a move the AMPAS Board of Governors is instituting for the first time this year. I am hearing through whatever grapevine that there will be only four selected for this inaugural year, with others (mostly crafts and shorts) rotating in subsequent years. AMPAS President John Bailey, the first prez ever to ascend from the Cinematographers branch, told me awhile back that he had an editor do a mockup of what it would look like and said it actually was better. We will see if Cinematography turns out to be one of those getting this treatment. Bailey told me at the time he wasn’t opposed to doing that to set an example.

Later on Monday will be the AARP Movies For Grownups Awards where, since Oscar also seems to favor “movies for grownups,” there will be a lot of these same faces we will be seeing all over Southern California this weekend. Oscar winner Shirley MacLaine is getting the Life Achievement Award, which should be fun.

CASTING DIRECTORS GET THEIR CLOSEUP BUT NOT AT THE OSCARS

CSA

Actually one awards-giving group got a head start on all of this on Thursday night at the Hilton, where honors were handed out for the Casting Society of America’s 34th annual Artios Awards. I never had been to this one in all the years I have been chronicling this scene, so I decided to go — if for no other reason than I hadn’t been to an awards banquet at the Beverly Hilton (my home away from home this time of year) in about a week and I missed the waiters.

This is one show that wasn’t necessarily predictive of where Oscar might be heading, since — despite lots of calls for one — the casting directors have yet to get their own category at the Academy Awards, even though they have been trying for three decades and now have an equal place now on the Board of Governors. Many of them actually do have an Oscar vote, but the best they have been able to get for their profession was finally an Honorary Oscar a couple of years ago for veteran Lynn Stalmaster. Nevertheless, the six winners in the film categories generally followed suit with other guilds as Best Picture nominees Green Book, BlackKklansman Vice (beating A Star Is Born among others in the big-budget drama category even though it has competed in comedy at other shows) and Black Panther all won in their respective categories. The waaaaay underrated indie gem The Kindergarten Teacher with Maggie Gyllenhaal proved a winner here for Netflix at the rare ceremony this season where their Roma didn’t rate even a nomination or mention from the stage. Crazy Rich Asians, perhaps the casting success of the year was also a winner in a comedy category.

Much of the talk, onstage and in the room, was about the fact that they can’t convince the Academy to create a Casting Director category. It came up during the presentation of the Honorary Artios Award to CSA founders Mike Fenton, Joe Reich, and Al Onorato. “We started trying 30 years ago to get a category at the Oscars, and now here 30 years later we still don’t have one. All I can say is wait until next year,” said the ever-hopeful Fenton. Another recipient was a bit more succinct: “We deserve the credit, and directors should really stop taking all the credit,” in what sounded like a declaration of war since it is believed, at least by many in the room last night, that the DGA and directors branch of the Academy don’t want to share the word, “director.”

This is not to say there weren’t a lot of heartfelt thank-yous from the stage to filmmakers they admire and work closely with day in and day out. Still, one upset casting director at my table pointed to past DGA president Taylor Hackford, who consistently has argued against an Oscar category, as he did in the 2013 documentary Casting By, opining that they don’t merit Oscar recognition because “they don’t direct anything.” It is not a matter of semantics, said the CAS member (and one of the night’s nominees) at my table, because historically they worked hard to earn the name “casting directors.”

CSA

In terms of participation onstage, Ryan Murphy, presenting the Hoyt Bowers Award to Ulrich/Dawson/Kritzer Casting (preceded by a great musical performance from Glee alums Darren Criss and Amber Riley, who they discovered for the show), and Jean-Marc Vallee presenting Lynn Stalmaster Career Achievement Award to Laura Dern were really the only name director presenters among a sea of grateful actor presenters who each told a story about their experience with those who practice this too-often-neglected craft. That touch added to the three-hour running time of the L.A. edition of the CAS show (which also happened in NYC) and includes a whopping 30 categories in film, TV, NY and LA theatrical etc. It still was a breezy affair, even if by the late hour when it got to the film awards and more than half the tables had emptied out causing winner Francine Maisler to crack, “it’s so nice to be up here when everyone has already left”.

CSA

Too bad for those people because they missed a great acceptance speech from Dern, who thanked the casting directors profusely for supporting a career that started at age 11 and for providing a vast diversity of roles to play. “I get to pay tribute to the people who not only championed me, in addition to a few filmmakers that I became so blessed to have find me, and to pay tribute to people I know who defined the career I longed to have,” she said. “And it’s a miracle that you all shaped this kind of opportunity to play such diverse, complicated, old, messy, hilarious, broken, angry, disturbed, lovely, kind, awful, delicious women.” She added that early in her career she was a “protected child” in this industry by casting directors, even at the risk of their own career. They looked after her when she was sometimes in “inappropriate rooms” where she should not have been. Big applause from the room on that.

The evening was fun and nicely hosted by Paul Scheer and Diane Raphael, who did the expected in-jokes that would be appreciated by this crowd such as casting director lingo to auditioning actors: “Let us know if you have any tattoos or if you’re cool doing nude” and “Do you know how many SAG cards are being used to cut up lines of coke tonight?”

WRITERS HIT THE FINAL DRAFT

Meanwhile, the 14th annual Final Draft screenwriting awards were handed out Tuesday night at the Paramount Studios Theatre (another ceremony I attended for the first time), and it was a breezy affair, handing out honors to “New Voices” in TV to Starz’s Vida creator Tanya Saracho and in film to Sorry to Bother You writer-director Boots Riley. Oscar-winning Thelma and Louise screenwriter and Nashville TV Series creator Callie Khouri was the recipient of the Hall of Fame Award.

It is the first of the seasonal writing awards shows, with USC Scripter honors coming next weekend and WGA the following on February 10. You can tell it was a writers ceremony, by the way, because the speeches were sooooo well written. Accepting her New Voice in TV for the powerful Vida, Saracho pulled no punches about what it means to be a Latina in this industry. “I accidentally landed on this town — Hollywood with a capital ‘H,’ where you have to fight not just for your artistry but to be counted in the fullness of your identity where that becomes a Fight with a capital ‘F’ every single day, like being in battle. But how can you not feel like being in battle?” she asked. “I am a Sagittarius and see everything on the macro. On the macro, as people, Latinas are being erased. We never were counted in the first place. Look at the landscape. We make up 20% of this country and you can count on the fingers of this hand the number of Latina-themed shows on television right now. Our narrative is discounted from the larger narrative of this country. We don’t count. I don’t know why. Right now we are fighting the big battle as they try to dismiss us, ignore us, cage us. On the micro, as an artist in this town, you start dragging that shit with you, into business dealings, in the constant explanation of your identity, and in the cultural defense of your work and your story. Not because you want to, that just is how it was set up, that’s just how it is.”

Final Draft

Accepting his award from Sorry to Bother You co-stars Terry Crews and Armie Hammer, Riley — a veteran rapper and music industry figure — talked about how his acclaimed first screenplay came about. “I was sitting in a hotel room on Hollywood Boulevard after doing a show and thinking this has got to be the time to get my story out, so I downloaded Final Draft. I just had the first scene, that’s all I had. I think I probably had other starts throughout the years where I sat and wrote it in a notebook, but I started typing it, and a few lines down, I was like, ‘Oh shit, this looks like a script!’ I mean, it really looked like a script. I was like, ‘I’m writing a script,;” he said in what could have been a commercial for the writing software Final Draft provides.

Final Draft

Khouri, on the other hand, accepted her Hall of Fame honor (from veteran Warner Bros executive Courtenay Valenti) by explaining how the apparent hate-crime attack on Jussie Smollett that day changed the scope of her speech. “I was going to talk about fraud and how prevalent it is these days and how I am recognized for writing when every time that happens I think it is probably part of an elaborate sting to weed out me from the real writers. I would be most qualified to write about how to avoid writing or I think I have become proficient while avoiding writing. I can do so many things so much better than I can write because everything is easier. I was going to talk about that, and about just how hard it is.”

She then turned serious. “And then I read today about Jussie Smollett, and I just decided I would talk about what this real job is and our responsibility as storytellers. What is our job in times like this? What is our responsibility? We have important work to do right now that cannot be stressed enough. We have to help each other understand how connected we are. We have to help each other through these absurd times. We are seeing in 2019 things that wouldn’t have looked out of place in 1939, and that’s a failure of our society. And so we have to keep telling these stories, “she said to big applause from the room packed with writers who know exactly what these honorees were saying. Before the show Khouri told me her next job is the long-awaited Aretha Franklin biopic starring Jennifer Hudson, who she describes as the perfect casting choice.

Randy and Jason Sklar did a nice job hosting, landing some good lines, and the evening also included awards to Feature and TV Grand Prize winners Jeff Cassidy and Myles Reid, winners of Final Draft’s Big Break Screenwriting Contest.

NETFLIX SALUTES ITS NOMINEES

Netflix

Netflix

Ted Sarandos and wife Nicole threw a party at their home Saturday night saluting all the Netflix nominees at various awards shows this season — including, of course, the Oscars, where the streamer landed a hearty 15 nominations including 10 for its first Best Picture contender, Roma. In his brief speech listing all the various achievements in both TV and movies, Sarandos turned stand-up comic for a moment (perhaps trying out to be host for this year’s Oscar show)? “It is a pretty unusual year. When else in history do you have Mary Poppins vigorously campaigning against Lady Gaga?” he asked. Actually Netflix has one of those Best Song nominees against those two films with “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings” from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.There were grumblings about the rumors that song, along with two other nominees wouldn’t be performed on the Oscarcast. One Netflix executive said they had indeed talked to Gigliotti and another Academy official about it and said it was clear this was a road they were thinking about possibly traveling. It is apparent that the backlash thankfully did the idea in, and now all five songs will be performed.

As Sarandos read off the long list of various nominations and wins Netflix has received this season, I couldn’t help but think a glaring omission was one of Ed Harris’ career best performances in Kodachrome, which the streamer picked up out of Toronto 2017 and ran in April. One of that film’s producers, Shawn Levy, who has Stranger Things and other content with Netflix lamented with me that they didn’t campaign the movie, and thus Harris’s extraordinary work was lost in the shuffle, which is really a shame. It could have been, and should have been, a 16th nomination under the Netflix banner this year. At the party, I got to catch up again with Quincy Jones, whose documentary Quincy is on Netflix (it won a Critics’ Choice Award). He was saying that come next week he will be up for his 80th (!) Grammy Award (with 27 wins) for Best Music Film for that documentary. Wow.

‘BLACK PANTHER’ FOR FREE

Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP/Shutterstock

Celebrating Black History Month, which starts today, Disney has decided to give away its Best Picture nominee, Black Panther for a week. Well, not exactly, but the studio has teamed up with AMC Theatres, which is offering 250 locations with two shows a day at each for free showings of the film in the theatrical format in which it was meant to be seen. “Black Panther is groundbreaking for many reasons, including the rich diversity of voices behind its success,” said a statement from Robert A. Iger, Chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company. “The story also showcases the power of knowledge to change the world for the better and the importance of ensuring everyone has access to it. We’re proud to provide thousands of free screenings of Black Panther in hopes it will continue to inspire audiences, and to support [the United Negro College Fund] with a $1.5 million grant to make the dream of higher education a reality for more students.” Not to be outdone in the philanthropy phase of Best Picture campaigns, Netflix is promising a portion from every ticket purchased for Roma in the month of February to be donated to the National Domestic Workers Alliance. Yes, it is still in some theaters despite having been streaming for well over a month on Netflix. How about also donating per Netflix viewer there too? At any rate, it is good to see some cash going to worthy causes this Oscar season.

Paramount

By the way, getting back to Black Panther:I was at the premiere of hilarious but definitely not Oscar worthy comedy What Men Want on Monday night. I ran into writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, whose most recent Mission: Impossible – Fallout was in my opinion easily the best action film this year — and certainly the best stunt-driven movie — so I asked him how can it be that Black Panther beat it for Outstanding Stunt Ensemble at the SAG Awards the night before. I missed that one since I predicted M:I-Fallout for the win. “I know, but I think the key word was ‘ensemble,'” McQuarrie said.” They probably looked at it and decided it was just Tom [Cruise] doing all the stunts in our movie.” That’s good point since Cruise had done so much publicity about performing so many of the stunts himself.

I congratulated McQuarrie for signing on to do two more M:I movies with Cruise. “They actually came to me and asked if I would do one more, but I upped the ante for them and said I would do two,” signaling good news for fans. He told me he is off on a location tour for the next one very shortly, even though the script hasn’t been written yet. “That is how we do these films,” he said. “We start by finding the locations we want to shoot in, and then I write to fit those.”"

""I'm really fired up tonight,"" Page told host Stephen Colbert toward the end of their impassioned interview. ""It feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and the Vice President, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the government of Indiana. And I think the thing we need to know -- and I hope my show Gaycation did this in terms of connecting the dots what happened the other day to Jussie. I don't know him personally, I send him all of my love.""

Page continued with rising emotion, ""Connect the dots, this is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you wanna cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f--king stop.""

On Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two unidentified assailants who reportedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs at the actor, poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around Smollett's neck. Smollett later told police that the two men allegedly shouted ""This is MAGA Country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Numerous celebrities and activists have spoken out in support of Smollett. The actor himself also released a statement on Friday, the first public comments he made since being hospitalized. ""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,"" Smollett said, in part, to Essence. ""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

As governor of Indiana, Pence supported anti-gay legislation -- including, as reported by TIME, voting against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which ""would have banned discrimination against people based on sexual orientation."" Pence has also spoken out against gay marriage.

Page stars in The Umbrella Academy which debuts Friday, Feb. 8 on Netflix.

Empire Co-Creator Lee Daniels, Fox Respond to Jussie Smollett Racist Attack

Smollett was attacked early Tuesday morning in a Chicago Subway restaurant by two men who beat him, allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs and said ""This is MAGA country,"" doused him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. The Chicago Police Department is investigating it as a possible hate crime and has released surveillance images of persons of interest.

Smollett's statement echoes many of the points made in his family's statement released on Thursday. ""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,"" the Smollett family said in part. ""Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.""

The president’s oldest son and namesake began Thursday morning by making himself an internet punchline after posting a tweet with the abbreviation for “Saturday Night Live” misspelled as “S&L.”

It’s almost like a funny version of an S&L skit. https://t.co/JSYVOyJZNk — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) January 31, 2019

Later in the day, he actually trumpeted a CNN report — instead of labeling it “#fakenews” — because it countered a Democratic talking point on the Russia investigation. CNN reported that Trump Jr. didn’t call his father around the time of the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.

But Trump Jr. also took some time Thursday and Friday to promote a widely spread theory about the reported hate crime attack against “Empire” actor and LGBTQ activist Jussie Smollett.

Trump Jr. liked and retweeted posts by people who have suggested that the reported attack early Tuesday in Chicago could be a left-wing hoax, perpetrated by a Hollywood celebrity who has been outspoken in his opposition to Trump’s presidency, according to Splinter News and a review of Trump Jr.’s Twitter feed. The investigation has since taken a turn, with police allegedly questioning whether Smollett staged the incident.

Among those promoting this view are conservative commentator Candace Owens, whose post Friday was liked by Trump Jr.

Meanwhile, Smollett on Friday broke his silence about the attack, issuing a statement to Essence: “I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger.” He also seemed to refute the hoax allegations by saying he is working with investigators and has been “factual and consistent” in his statements to them.

TMZ reported that Smollett’s representatives had clarified several points attributed to Smollett’s account that prompted Trump Jr., Owens and others to assert that he has exaggerated or fabricated the incident.

According to police, Smollett was attacked after he left a Subway restaurant near his apartment in downtown Chicago. The attackers first yelled racial and homophobic slurs before they beat him and poured an unknown chemical substance over him, officials said; they also reportedly yelled “This is MAGA country,” and one wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck.

Smollett’s representatives told TMZ that he declined to turn over his phone to police when “informally asked.” Police reportedly wanted to verify that he was talking to his manager when the attack occurred.

The sources said Smollett was “uncomfortable” giving up his phone. Contrary to some reports, Smollett is willing to provide his phone records and is in the process of gathering them.

Smollett also denied ever telling police his attackers were wearing red MAGA hats, the sources said. Instead, the actor said, they screamed “MAGA country.”

Finally, Smollett said he kept the rope around his neck after the attack to “preserve the evidence,” according to his representatives. He only kept it on until police arrived at his building 42 minutes after the incident. Contrary to some reports, Smollett didn’t have the rope around his neck when he later went to the hospital.

Splinter News described Smollett’s attack as the “latest scandal du jour for the internet’s assortment of cranks, conspiracy mongers and racists.”

Trump Jr. began his Smollett commentary midday Thursday by liking a tweet by conservative comedian Terrence K. Williams, who called Smollett’s story “fishy.”

Williams’ tweet came about the same time Thursday that President Donald Trump was in the Oval Office offering brief remarks about the attack.

In response to a reporter’s question about the attack, Trump replied, “That I can tell you is horrible. I’ve seen it … last night. It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

But Trump didn’t elaborate on the case or address the report that the attackers shouted “MAGA country,” apparently to show their allegiance to the president’s particular right-wing views.

As for Trump Jr.’s comments on the case, the president’s son also liked a tweet from a radio pundit who brought up the report about Smollett’s phone to cast doubt on his story.

On Friday, Trump Jr. was busy again on the Smollett case, in between touting a report that the U.S. economy added 304,000 jobs in January and retweeting a post from a Fox News contributor calling House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff “the sleaziest swamp rat.”

In addition to liking the tweet from Owens, Trump Jr. also gave a thumbs up to this one:

The Jussie Smollett assault story just got even more strange

Jussie Smollett speaks out in first public appearance since reported attack Trump Jr. is no stranger to promoting questionable stories, especially when they challenge his father’s political or media enemies.

In late October, he liked tweets related to the spate of of suspicious packages sent to prominent Democrats and CNN offices in New York City, according to Yahoo News. Trump Jr. liked tweets that suggested the acts were actually carried out by Democrats or Democratic allies in an attempt to “pick up blue sympathy” votes in the weeks before the midterm elections.

In September, CNN host Anderson Cooper chastised Trump Jr. for “tweeting lies” about his coverage of Hurricane Florence.

Trump Jr. shared a photo circulating online of him covering 2008’s Hurricane Ike and falsely claimed that the photo showed Cooper covering Hurricane Florence, which struck the Carolinas in late August and early September.

Trump Jr. shared the photo of Cooper in waist-high water in order to accuse the anchor of overly dramatizing the seriousness of the hurricane to make his father look bad.

Cooper devoted several minutes of his show to debunking Trump Jr.’s tweet, wrapping up his segment by saying, “Look, I don’t expect the president’s son to ever admit that he was wrong or one of the president’s advisers or frankly anyone else who’s retweeted any of these pictures. But I at least thought that they and you should know the truth.”"

CHICAGO -- ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett said Friday that he has been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation into what he says was a racist and homophobic attack on him in downtown Chicago earlier this week.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

“It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace,” he said about what he termed a crisis at the Mexican border.

“And now you have problems even with, I understand yesterday, even people from Venezuela want to come through, everybody wants to come through,” he said, apparently referring to people fleeing the chaos in the South American nation.

He then said that the US was already building the wall, with “cash on hand.”

“I will say we will have 115 miles of wall, maybe a little more than that, very shortly. It’s being built. Some of it has already been completed. In San Diego, if you look, it’s completed. Really nice. I mean, we’re building it with funds that are on hand, we’re negotiating very tough prices,” he said.

“We’re already appropriated. We have a lot of appropriation. It’s already been done, and certain other things we’ll be doing that we haven’t done yet, and one of the things we’re considering, obviously, is a national emergency. And it is, it’s an invasion of our country of not only gangs and criminals and human traffickers, it’s an invasion of drugs into our country,” he said.

The new wall, he said, has also been redesigned to improve its appearance.

“We’ve designed a much better-looking wall that is also actually a better wall which is an interesting combination. It’s far more beautiful, and it’s better. It’s much more protective. But it looks better because the walls they used to build were not very attractive,” he continued.

“The chant now should be ‘finish the wall’ as opposed to ‘build the wall,’ because we’re building a lot of wall.”

He lambasted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic lawmakers for opposing the wall for what he said were purely political reasons heading into the 2020 election.

“It’s going to be part of their campaign but I don’t think it’s good politically. Nancy Pelosi is hurting a lot of people. In all fairness to the Democrats, many of them want the wall. They’re just dying to say what they want to say, but they can’t say it as well as they would be able to if they were allowed to do it,” he said.

The president said he had “very strong legal standing” to declare a national emergency at the border.

“Having a national emergency does help the process. It would certainly help the process. What would help a lot would be if the Democrats could actually be honest. If they’re not being honest, everybody knows they’re not being honest, they know they’re not being honest,” he said.

And he accused Central American countries of creating caravans to get rid of people they don’t want.

“They’re allowing [caravans] to start, and they want it to start, because they want to not have certain people in that country. What do they do, they put them in the caravan,” he claimed.

But the US, he said, was doing a laudable job thwarting the caravans’ advance.

“We’ve done a great job with the caravans, an incredible job. Most of them have gone back where they’re staying on the other side of the wall. They haven’t been coming in, for the most part. we’ve done a great job,” he said.

Pelosi is part of a 17-member, bipartisan Homeland Security Committee that is working on a compromise bill on border security.

Pelosi said Thursday the bill would not include money for Trump’s wall, but that cash for barrier fencing was on the table.

The committee has a deadline of Feb. 15, when temporary spending bills to fund about one-quarter of the federal government expire."

A new study has found that people who regularly ate breakfast actually ended up consuming more calories throughout the day and gained more weight than people who skipped their morning meals.

Researchers at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, combed through 13 clinical trials from developed countries, including the United States in the past 28 years.

“The people who eat breakfast tend to have on average 260 calories a day extra and they tend to be heavier,” Flavia Cicuttini, professor of epidemiology at Monash University and co-author of the study, told CNN.

“This study clearly shows [breakfast] isn’t a good idea.”

Meanwhile, the researchers also found that people who didn’t have morning meals were about 1 pound lighter than breakfast lovers and they didn’t have an increase in appetite during the day.

According to Cicuttini, this difference in scale could mean that eating breakfast causes weight gain “simply by more calorie intake.”

However, she did point out her study’s limitations. Some of the 13 trials that were featured didn’t last long, affecting the data.

But while Cicuttini doesn’t want to discourage people from eating breakfast, she has advised overweight people to monitor their calorie intake if they do.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture’s healthy eating guideline, the average American should consume about 36 percent of their daily calories from breakfast.

And nutritionist Sarah Coe says that the weight effects of breakfast vary from person to person.

“Findings of this review may not fit with existing recommendations, but they reflect the current uncertainty about the relationship between eating breakfast and weight within the scientific literature,” Coe, who works at the British Nutrition Foundation, told CNN.

“For people trying to lose weight, the key to success is finding something that works for them and that they can stick to.”"

The alleged incident happened when Smollett was heading to a Subway restaurant and two white men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him. They also punched him, fractured one of his ribs, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and tied a noose around his neck.

It was said also the two men asked Smollett if he was that “N—- from ‘Empire'” and told him “This is MAGA country.” He was later treated and released at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and seen with cuts on his face.

On Friday, Feb. 1, Smollett released a statement in which the actor said he’s pulling through and appreciative of all the support.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” he let people know. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

The 35-year-old also addressed some misinformation he came across online and denied that he’s changed his story about the details of the incident.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he stated. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett’s family mirrored the same words about the actor fully cooperating with police in a statement they released the previous day. On that same day, NBC News reported that Smollett didn’t want to hand his cellphone to Chicago police who asked for it to help with their investigation. But Friday Chicago police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said the “Empire” star wouldn’t be forced to do so.

“The allegations as reported to us are horrendous,” said Johnson in a statement. “He’s a victim. We don’t treat him like a criminal. [Smollett] has been very cooperative with us.”"

There are copious amounts of cocaine, '80s fashion, and cigarettes, not unlike 2013's Wolf Of Wall Street. However, there is one thing that you shouldn't expect in this fictional version of events created by Jordan Cahan and David Caspe: female nudity.

Vulture offered up a tidbit from Black Monday's press day at the Television Critics Association where Cahan made the declaration. He elaborated on this position by saying, ""Despite the fact that that was a huge piece of that world... we are a comedy and we don't necessarily want to contribute to that."" Even though Black Monday has been met with mixed reviews, I can appreciate the show's creators for not using female bodies to accessorize the already sleazy setting.

On the flipside, it seems male body parts are okay. In the premiere, one of the more seasoned traders mockingly puts his dick (a prosthetic penis, Vulture notes) on the shoulder of rookie tech guy Blair (Andrew Rannells). It was indeed hilarious."

Appearing on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, the out actress implored people to ""connect the dots"" between hateful rhetoric and violence against marginalized people.

Actress and producer Ellen Page railed against the Trump administration, and particularly against Mike Pence, for fomenting an environment that leads to marginalized people becoming the targets of harassment, like the incident this week in which Empire star Jussie Smollett was beaten while assailants hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

“Connect the dots,” Page demanded after listing the ways in which she views Pence as a threat to LGBTQ people.

The Juno star, who came out as gay at an LGBTQ youth conference in 2014, was appearing Thursday on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert to promote her new Netflix series, The Umbrella Academy, when she spoke out passionately against the administration.

“It feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the president and the vice president, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married,” a visibly upset Page told Colbert.

“Let’s just be clear. The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana,” Page said, pointing to a picture of her with her wife, dancer and choreographer Emma Portner. “He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.”

By the end of her appearance, she was imploring people to make a connection between hateful rhetoric emanating from those in power and the bullying and violence marginalized people face.

“In terms of what happened the other day to Jussie … connect the dots. This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them. You go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?” Page said.

“Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street,” she continued. This needs to fucking stop.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson is also addressing some of the skepticism about Smollett's account of the attack that's lighting up social media.

Johnson was asked by reporters, “based on the information that detectives have, can you confirm that an attack happened?”

“We don’t have anything that we have been able to view but I will say this, he's a victim right now. And we'll treat him like a victim. He's been very co-operative and we have no reason to think that he is not being genuine with us,” Johnson said.

He said he's hopeful that shadowy images of two men in the area where Smollett was beaten will lead to arrests.

“The crime that he reported is horrendous. It is horrible it was cowardly. We will do everything we can,” Johnson said. “We have identified two potential persons of interest that we would like to talk to so hopefully we will bring this to a resolution soon.”

The cast returned to work Friday after production was suspended due to the bitter Chicago cold. There was a heavy police presence as they shot scenes in Northwest Chicago.

Images of two “people of interest” have been released by police investigating a suspected hate attack on a US actor.

Jussie Smollett, known for the show Empire, was attacked by two people in Chicago earlier this week.

He was hit, had an “unknown chemical substance” poured on him and a rope was wrapped around his neck.

The suspects are reported to have shouted “racial and homophobic slurs” and Jussie says they referenced MAGA – the slogan Make America Great Again.

Releasing the two images, Chicago police said surveillance video of the attack has not yet been found, but that more cameras are being reviewed.

A police spokesperson tweeted that they were “taking this development seriously”.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Viola Davis, Naomi Campbell and Janelle Monae sent messages of support to Jussie after the attack.

Jussie hasn’t spoken since the attack, but his publicist has released a family statement to the news agency Reuters.

“Our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack,” it says.

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.”

The creator of Empire, Lee Daniels, posted an emotional video on Instagram in the days after the attack.

He said: “You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck.

“America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united.”

US comedian and presenter Steve Harvey also supported the actor with an Instagram video, saying: “This ain’t about sexual preference or nothing. This is about coming to the aid of another brother that has tasted the brutality of hatred and racism and bigotry.” BBC"

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed rumors leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven’t found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support” he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it “horrible.” But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn’t cooperated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett’s refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

Police have not suggested that Smollett or his manager have been untruthful in any way. Today, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven’t found video of the attack, Smollett has been “very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.”

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn’t be unusual that such an attack wouldn’t be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn’t provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don’t continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

“Somewhere out there there’s a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,” he said, pointing out that the two aren’t considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence."

CHICAGO — ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett said Friday that he has been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation into what he says was a racist and homophobic attack on him in downtown Chicago earlier this week.

PledgeMusic executives have yet to convince the British Musicians’ Union it can turn things around and get artists paid.

Frankly speaking, PledgeMusic isn’t in a very good place right now.

Industry analyst Bob Lefsetz recently published a significant number of e-mails from artists and rights owners with delayed checks from the crowdfunding platform.

PledgeMusic, for example, owes one band, Fastball, $21,000. The company also owes another band, ohGR, $100,000. Former Skinny Puppy members Nivek Ogre and Mark Walk created the latter group.

This isn’t the first time the company has faced serious accusations of delayed payments.

Last summer, faced with a barrage of complaints, PledgeMusic blamed ‘a transition in payment platforms.’

In a statement, the crowdfunding platform vowed,

“It is our expectation that payments will be brought current within the next 90 days.”

This year, amidst criticism, PledgeMusic released a similar statement, which is basically the same excuse the company has made for months.

To help the platform turn things around, and finally pay artists, Benji Rogers, PledgeMusic’s Co-Founder, returned to the company.

In a statement, he wrote,

“I have agreed, on a short-term basis, to return to PledgeMusic as a volunteer strategic advisor and observer to the board. I have seen first-hand how tirelessly the team, management, and board have been working to right the ship and that is why I have agreed to help where I can.”

Yet, Rogers and the company haven’t convinced everybody.

Losing confidence in this crowdfunding platform.

After meeting with company executives on Wednesday, the British Musicians’ Union warned artists to use other platforms “until such time [after] this situation has been resolved.”

If something goes wrong, blame President Donald Trump and his administration.

We’ve seen this more recently with the alleged hate crime against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett. The actor, who is gay and black, says two assailants did more than attack him late last month in Chicago. They doused him with bleach, put a noose-like rope around his neck, and bombarded him with racial and sexual taunts.

And, in some versions of the story, the attackers name-checked “MAGA country,” meaning they were Trump supporters.

Why use the word “alleged” with his story? Some elements seem unusual.

Smollett refused to hand over his phone to police so they could corroborate the call he says he made to his manager

Smollett asked officers to turn off their body cams when they interviewed him

It seems more than odd that an attack would take place late at night during the polar vortex, when temperatures plummetted well below even your average freezing Chicago winter

Why was Smollett on the phone with his manager at 2 a.m.?

And, an element of the story the media won’t bring up, Smollett is an avowed Trump hater with a reason to bring a Trump angle into the story

Celebrities instantly connected the attack to President Trump’s supporters. Ellen Page, star of “Juno” and “Hard Candy,” doubled down on that attack via “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”

It feels impossible to not feel this way now with the president and Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married. Let’s just be clear: The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana, and I think the thing that we need to know — and I hope my show “Gaycation” did this in terms of connecting the dots in terms of what happened the other day to Jussie. I don’t know him personally. I send all of my love. Connect the dots. This is what happens if you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them — you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?

For what it’s worth, Page and her celebrity peers neglected to connect James Hodgkinson, who nearly killed Rep. Steve Scalise, to his hard-left views and admiration for Sen. Bernie Sanders.

More importantly, celebrities and pundits alike should hold their rhetorical fire until we know the full story. Smollett may indeed be the victim of a hate crime. If true, a single event does not necessarily connect to an entire community, let alone a sitting president and vice president."

Smollett told E News that he is “OK” making it his first public statement since the assault in Chiacago.

He said:

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.” “I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level.

Page spoke about the fact that the news media often frames issues that have one logical side as a ""debate,"" pointing to the way that global warming is discussed. She then called out the fact that the media is similarly saying that it's up for debate whether the attack on Smollett was a hate crime, even though the attackers used racist and homophobic slurs during it.

She then honed in on the impact that hateful rhetoric that the Trump administration uses when referring to minorities, specifically the LGBTQ community, has. In talking about the homophobic policies that now-Vice President Mike Pence tried to enact when he was the governor of Indiana, she got visibly upset. ""The vice president of America wishes I didn't have that love with my wife [Emma Portner],"" she said. ""He wanted to ban that in Indiana.""

She also brought up the fact that Gaycation, in which she explores the LGBTQ communities around the globe, has caused her to meet ""the most marginalized people you could meet,"" and noted that she is ""lucky to have the time and the privilege to say this.""

For the rest of you, I see you, I feel you, and I hope you feel me too. What a month, what a month, what mighty hard month. We can commiserate all we like, we can commiserate right into February which, as is the way of things, picks up where January dropped off and snaps the reins. Opposing forces, like two horses, drag the chariot of time forward. Whatever transformations the eclipses of the past month spurred in you, reader, February pushes them onward with visions and possibilities. What might have felt like a tear in the fabric has created an opening through which opportunities flow like so many shooting stars and comets. The catch? If you spend your days worrying the tear and kicking rocks, you'll miss the light show in the sky. So, look up and make a wish. Forget those old New Year's resolutions. Celebrate the new moon on February 4 and Chinese New Year on February 5 and make all new resolutions!

Mars, the planet of action, is active all month long, moving into steadfast sensual Taurus, who knows what she wants and how she means to get it. Venus, optimistic and forgiving in Sagittarius, does her best to offer our collective conscious a different angle toward love and varied ways of seeing what intimacy looks like when we liberate ourselves from old mental traps. Mercury in Pisces is murky and indirect, but it is not without the gift of imagination. While it might feel tempting to throw your hands up in the face of whatever chaos you've come from, while it might feel reasonable to take on the suffering of our global world and let it make a living corpse you—it will help no one. Figure out a way to align your difficult transitions with the values you guard and nurture at your core. It might seem impossible and unlikely, but the chance of a better future is real. Realer, still, if you choose to move toward it.

Aquarius

What would the perfect world look like if it was made in your honor? Who would you gather under your swirling disco light, your star-studded web, and who would you talk to first? While Mercury spins in Aquarius, soak up your heightened sense of abundance: ideas and the connections between all things. Once you said to me, ""I don't want to ache, I just want to lose my bearings."" Few bearing can survive a windstorm, Aquarius, and I hear one is coming around some of these parts. If you're looking for a wild wind, you can't go wrong giving yourself to the wind of beauty, all the words for it, all the names you've yet to taste in your own mouth. Don't worry about meaning right now, or boxes, or any kind of baggage.

If you're looking to lose something that weighs you down, lose convention. It was never natural the way you carried it, anyway, trying your damnedest to fit your ever-expanding life into a plain suitcase someone else made. This is when you begin to put it down without guilt or grief.

What's that Marie Kondo said about releasing what served you once but no longer brings you joy? Hold it in your hands, thank it for its service, and let it go. I think you know how to do that with a version of yourself, or an idea you had once about how your life should go. You might be a fixed sign, but your stars are changing. This month, expect a heightened sense of intuition, a change of perspective, a feeling that not only is the world more generous but you are more generous in this world. Happy birthday, sweet star, expect anything—plan accordingly.

PISCES

You know that antiquated language of going steady? I'm thinking about what it meant to ask someone to ""go steady,"" to be unwavering in your affection, to be consistent and constant, to be safe. What about if, this month, you turn that language toward something more singular? I'd like to ask you, Pisces, to consider making a deeper commitment to yourself. What would that look like anyway, personal steadiness? Financial accountability—examining where it comes from, where it goes, defining what financial stability means to you—a balancing of the books in every sense. Examining your emotional resources: how much nurturance and care do you offer and at what cost? Does your emotional labor (interpersonally or more widely) sustain you or does it deplete you? If your answer is that emotional labor gives you a sense of purpose—I promise you that the care you offer is not your purpose, it is only one of your powers.

This month go steady with yourself, Pisces, and give your other powers a chance to grow. Mercury, the planet of communication, lands under your stars in early February but candid Mercury doesn't do so well in evasive Pisces. Plus, by mid-month, we'll all be feeling the shadow of Mercury Retrograde, which will make communication and connection even more difficult.

You might be the royal highness of multiple realities, Pisces, but I think this month has more than a little to teach you about multiple truths. And, the fact that sometimes you don't get to choose which truth floats up and which one sinks beneath the surface. This time, the lives you traverse and the effects of your decisions will have a greater impact on you than you might be ready for. You can endure a great deal, you can give a lot of slack, and you can hold the weight but—Pisces—you don't have to. By the end of the month, tensions will give way to a greater sense of personal resolve. With Mercury in Pisces making a trine to true node in Cancer, followed by your Sun sextiling Mars in Taurus, your steady commitment to strengthening your foundation will prove to be your best and most enduring valentine.

Aries

Because we are both subject to the planet Mars, dear Aries, I'll let you in on a secret. This month, I pulled a tarot card for every sign, and each time the cards matched my astro-work so clearly, it was as if they were sent down to me from the stars themselves. Well, maybe they were. Who knows? It can be tough to believe in something unless it aligns perfectly with what we already know to be true. But, knowing is a tricky business. This time, I felt validated, but sometimes I need a negation to understand that what drives my actions/beliefs isn't ego—it's witness. What about you? What do you believe in? If there's no god for you, or gods, is there a highest good? Even an atheist will come to their knees before a mountain. Or a great love.

Are you interested in awe, Aries? Interest and want alone are not enough. Interest and yearning must give way to the work. I know work, you might say, irreverently. But I don't think you know this kind. I don't think you know this kind because the soul's work is like a river. It is always water, and it is always flowing, and, as they say, you never step into the same one twice.

These past few years have been transformational for you, yes, but have you stabilized the ground you've built your world on? Have you tended to the foundation and the bones? This month, whatever you stored in the basement—untended, aching—will cry to be let upstairs, nurtured and seen. This year, you will find yourself charged with the grief you carry as one is charged with a small child. You will find that no amount of success will give her the nurturance she needs, no promotion, no lover, no pill. This month will offer you chance after chance to witness that child as one does a mountain or a great love: with awe and sacred regard.

Taurus

Just because it feels impossible doesn't mean it's not worth believing in. Just because the rewards for all your hard work haven't been coming in the way you were hoping they would, doesn't mean they haven't been coming. My sweet, steadfast believer. If you were raised in a world where success requires proof and wealth is measured by what one feels entitled to—if you were raised to believe that an invisible rope unwinds and contracts your right to freedom based on how much money you earn and how much you produce—you are not alone. Of course, the vastness of a belief doesn't give it potency or power. Only we do that.

And you've begun to change your mind, haven't you Taurus? You've begun to take stock of your capacity to amass wealth in a way no ever taught you to define it: your wealth of knowledge, your wealth of relations, your deep reserve of spiritual strength.

The answer is not a crumbling tower, Taurus, you need not destroy everything you've built on the material plane just to access what you ache for: purpose. You already have purpose. The visions that come to you might feel without means now, but the means are all around you—slow to make themselves known but very real none the less. Do not make less of your work, sweet bull, do not diminish how far you've come by wishing away the years that got you here. And, don't burn any bridges you'll be needing to cross. Just have faith in what you've built and bet on yourself. Your meticulous will to change, to wear a new path through the tall grass, to walk with intention to water and offer that water to the herd that follows you—it is no small offering.

Gemini

Life isn't all fun and games, but life can be fun and games for a little while. Why not? Winter is long and dreary, and you're a summer baby with summer in your heart. So, go ahead, play. Play the field, play the fool, play creatively and play it as it lays (as Joan would write). There will be time soon enough for figuring out what lies ahead, but, for now, you're better off basking in the visions that come to you, the ideas, and the future possibilities. In fact, making sense of it now, or putting a label onto something unwieldy, might prove limiting and ultimately disappointing.

I'm not a huge fan of secrets, so let's not call this world you're exploring a secret, let's call it protected. Protected from convention and convention's insatiable appetite for proof.

""Life moves so mysterious with its cute little spins"":

All day I've been listening to (Gemini) Ferron (yes I'm that lesbian) sing ""Snowing in Brooklyn."" It's about coming back from heartache. And it's about coming back to a world that thinks it knows all about you, but even you don't know all about you. The refrain is so sweet and affirming and solid: ""If it's snowin' in Brooklyn. I'd say snow's what we've got.""

If it's snowing in Brooklyn, then snow is all around you. If you're going with the flow, keep going, but stay present. Note the way this freedom makes you feel, note the information it gives you about yourself: your boundaries and your wide-open doors. There is hope here for something new and although the catalyst lies outside, what you want wants to grow within you. There are forces around you that are beyond your control, but that doesn't mean you have no control over the ways in which you participate with those forces.

Cancer

Everyone on the internet has been saying that January has been one long year of a month and that might be true. What's also true is that the eclipse cycles that began in 2017, and spun back toward you in January, taught you about the elasticity of time like none other. Sure, January was long but so was December. And, hasn't half a year passed since November? And wasn't June just yesterday? Measuring your life, it's waves and storms, seems less than ideal in a world that burns all around us and burns inside us—with hopelessness, with rage, and with courage too. Better to sit outside time and count your blessings, regard the web of relations you've spun around you as indication that love is real and abundant. That pain is not the only teacher.

To burn with courage in the face of loss, to guard your vulnerability without effacing it, these are deeply Cancerian gifts, and you have spent unknowable time developing them.

You have labored well in the corporeal world under difficult circumstance, you have carried your emotional tumult from task to task, doing what needed to be done for the sake of survival.

This month, February envelops you, guarding you as you work to come back to yourself; as winter guards the seeds of spring beneath its hardened earth. Winter is difficult, yes, and harsh—there is death here, and grief too—but now, more than ever, you are being asked to acknowledge the turning of the wheel. Your own hand readying the spin. There are many kinds of death, Cancer, spiritual, physical, emotional, and all of them are necessary for something new to come.

Leo

Close your eyes, little lion, and check in. I think your body has been missing you. I think your body wants your sweet attention, a big stretch, a series of deep and deeper breaths. I know you know how to work up a sweat and you can start there, if it feels right. Run up and down a flight of stairs, take a movement-based yoga class, swim, anything that gets your blood pumping back to your heart because your heart has been keeping you alive this whole time. And, have you been listening to it? Your engine of survival, where every ache is a signal, every yearning an indication, but the language is not simple—is not surface—you've got to pay attention.

Your body knows more than you think it does about what you feel. Your body can teach you when you are feeling anxious or afraid. While our minds rationalize, compartmentalize, and lift us far from the scene like little escape hatches, our bodies can teach us that pain lasts a long time when it is not attended to and suffering can be a kind of prayer against forgetting.

If you've already been lifted far above scene and you can barely feel at all, okay. Distance, even when dissociative, is the mind's protection. It can be a gift too, for a little while. It can give you the chance to look back at the big picture and really notice the shape of your life, it's little roads and houses, children playing by rivers, mayors and the maintenance crews. What I'm saying is, you are kinder and more generous than any city planner in the capitalist machine. You have the capacity for gratitude, for seeing work that is invisible and honoring it as vital to your life. What I mean is, even when you give up on yourself, your people won't, and when you come back to yourself, you find your people waiting. Now get your heart pumping and honor that.

VIRGO

I don't think a lot of astrology write-ups mention how intuitive you can be, how gifted many Virgos are with second sight. Maybe it's a gift that comes down from on high, zapping your human brain with electric knowing. Or, maybe it's the mutable earth in you, maybe you move through the forest of your life like a deer, alert to every branch's snap, attuned to new scents in the dirt and water, warned by a single hair left caught in the mossy ground covering. What they call skittish but what you pride yourself on: attention.

What you sense is what you know, Virgo, you need not doubt it. Trust your intuition and practice self-protection. Separate if you need to, guard your psychic space if it wants guarding. Life, and the people in it, will eventually offer a whole host of explanations. There will be time for you to listen and consider what to do with what you hear.

For now, strengthen your boundaries and focus on your projects. Yes, you have friends you can turn to, yes, there is companionship that is worthy of your energy, but this month, with the salt circle cast and the bubble up, you are your own most trusted companion. Inside your dome, your dreams are free to take material form and jump on the assembly line. There, you can take creative risks, resist perfectionism, and prepare to put yourself out there in a way that feels wholly authentic and useful to you. Just don't trap yourself inside your own guard or you'll grow thirsty. Your shield, like the deer's camouflage, is your protection. When you need to drink from the river, when you need to shine in the sun, use your powers to your advantage.

Libra

Who can fault you for getting down in the wintertime? It's the season that asks for much maintenance, energy, and attention with hardly any of the sun's warmth. One comes home tense from bracing themselves. Just like anyone, you get tired, worn down, and prone to sickness. Counter to the season's indications, the universe is very invested in strengthening your powers at this time. While the immediate environment proves itself often sharp and unrelenting, rays of generous energy flow toward you offering the gift of pragmatism and abundance.

Pragmatism? You might wonder. What for and how? Pragmatism, my beautiful friend, is using your gifts practically and beneficially. To you and to those around you. Pragmatism is the practice of ascertaining what the world offers and reaching for it with a sound approach and ready sense of application.

The weather won't be all that gets you down this month, and there's indication that communication issues will arise in the family matters or matters of the home. Do your best to work past your instinct for sideways speech. Practice right speech whenever possible. If anticipating tension has got you down or if accessing your pragmatic powers seems impossible when your body is your obstacle—pragmatize your relationship with your body. Add things that bring you pleasure to your schedule. Add self-nurturance to your schedule. In the factory of being, there's a clipboard with maintenance checks. Even a beautiful machine needs fuel to run.

Scorpio

Someone taught you once that there is no such thing as a safe space, and they were wrong. They were wrong to teach you that because they did not register the possibilities of your magnificent body. How safety threatened can be safety re-imagined. How the cells and sinews that make you who you are, light up like an alarm system and get to work spinning an elaborate net that protects you from what threatens to destroy you. Someone taught you that there is no such thing as a safe space because they had forgotten what it was like to trust themselves. And they were so busy projecting their fear onto you, they missed recognizing your singular power.

A Scorpio guards their own truth and the truths of everyone they love. A Scorpio's work is guarding the sanctuary that is ancient inside them, the sanctuary where any heart entrusted comes to rest. If an entrusted heart seeks to leave your sanctuary and fend for itself, let it. The shelter you offer is not a prison. If you are afraid your own heart is not safe in the shelter of yourself, you are mistaken. Rest.

Psychic danger is spiritual danger, what wounds the mind infects the body and chains it to the earth. But, a Scorpio in danger is a Scorpio transforming, and transformation needs solitude, sleep, and succor. You are the only one who can give yourself those things. Do you think a snake slipping off its old skin spends its time wondering whether all the effort will be worth it? I don't think so. I think you have an instinct for shedding, a bittersweet love for it. I think a snake is familiar with death when it wraps around her, an intimacy, a closeness to something like god.

Sagittarius

You can be spontaneous without being reckless. You can take a risk, an emotional one, a creative one, a financial one, without losing your head or—god forbid—your heart. You have the power, Sagittarius, to harness the fire that lives in you with consideration and intention. So, go ahead, set a flame to that arrow and aim it farther than you ever let yourself aim it before. You deserve to take a chance on yourself and to dream. Just make sure the target you're aiming for is a target that can shelter your fire rather than extinguish it or spread it where it may cause more harm than good.

Patience is not your virtue, Pony, no matter how many books you read that teach you about patience. But, kindness and diligence? You've got that in spades. Humility, too, grows in you as you spend more and more time sitting with the varied truths of the world—recognizing that even the false is tender, even the jagged is beautiful. Virtues aren't just powers of perception, they are also tools, Sagittarius.

What I'm trying to say is, it'll be worth your time to celebrate the virtues that you've got and apply them to the possibility that you were meant for more in this world. Use your tools and use them wisely. Don't make yourself small to accommodate a small town or a lineage of smallness. Or, conversely, don't make yourself small for fear that somehow life will prove you've been small all along. Why smother your fire for fear that a big wind might come and put it out when you are the one that sparks new fires? Big changes in your self-perception are par for the course this month, and you will do well to embrace the biggest version of yourself.

Capricorn

Put yourself out there. Put yourself out there again and this time let it be more than your anger, more than your beauty, more than your capacity to help others. Take a creative risk but don't call it a risk because risks make you nervous, call it a creative leap in good faith. Haven't you climbed the side of the mountain long enough to take in the view? Don't you think it might reward your soul to do something less strenuous for a while, less invested in self-limitations under the guise of self-development?

Why limit yourself so fervently when all the forces in power, with their guns and their wars and their white hetero male masc. supremacy, have built an empire in the name of limiting your personal power?

And, what is your personal power? Compersion, the feeling of elation at witnessing the success of others whom you love and admire. Compassion, a tendency to offer concern and care even to those who've caused your harm. Capricorn, you don't need to compromise your core sense of self to prove your personal powers to others. In fact, in compromising yourself, you weaken your ability to access those powers in yourself. The ones who see you also know you, and they will weep with you as they walk the long road alongside. The others can find their own way to the top of the mountain so don't worry who or what you must leave behind in the arduous effort to choose yourself. Choose yourself anyway. As the adage goes: The ones who mind don't matter and the ones who matter don't mind."

A day after the historically Black sorority celebrated it’s 99th anniversary on Jan. 16, the mural was painted over on Jan. 17, with the words “It’s OK to be white.”

The slogan, “It’s OK to be white,” is reportedly the popular phrase commonly used by white supremacists in online discussion groups like the controversial 4chan. White supremacist websites like The Daily Stormer and hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan, have since adopted the saying.

“On its face, the statement is both innocuous and obvious. It is OK to be white. But the intent of the flyer’s author is not to state the obvious. It is to find sympathizers to the white nationalists’ cause,” Richard A. Baker, the president of the American Association for Access, Equity and Diversity, told Inside Higher Ed via email.

The saying was painted on the Beta Bridge on campus, located on Rugby Road. Since 1926, it has been a tradition by University of Virginia students to paint messages and information to share with the campus and surrounding community.

“Graffiti and comments that are hateful or aimed to intimidate others are inconsistent with our shared values and have no place anywhere in our community,” University spokesperson Anthony de Bruyn said in an email statement to The Cavalier Daily, the student newspaper who broke the story.

“Over many years, Beta Bridge has become a public forum for the community, similar to the free speech wall in downtown Charlottesville,” de Bruyn told The Cavalier Daily. “Although the bridge is city property, it is seen by many as a place where the University community can share messages about important events in the life of the University.”

The University released a statement on Friday condemning the insensitive act, saying it’s, “racially motivated targeting of the sorority’s positive message on Beta Bridge.”

“We are very glad Zeta Phi Beta is part of the UVA Greek community and this institution is better for their presence here.”

White supremacist activity is on the rise. Back in November, “OK to be white” leaflets went left on the campus of the University of Vermont and Champlain College. They have also popped up at the American River College, Duke University, North Carolina State University, Tufts University, the University of Delaware, the University of Denver and the University of St. Thomas, in Minnesota, Inside Higher Ed reports.

Meanwhile, the Charlottesville Police Department doesn’t deem that this incident warrants further investigation."

The Empire actor, who plays gay singer Jamal Lyon, was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago earlier this week, leaving him with a series of injuries.

The 35-year-old said to Essence in a statement: ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" he added.

The actor ended his statement by saying: ""Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

Before Smollett released his statement, his family labelled the attack as ""racist, homophobic and domestic terrorism"".

The Sun reported his family pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

It reads: ""This was a racial, homophobic hate crime … We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings.""

They continued: ""These are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.""

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2am on Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Ellen Page is the most recent celebrity to speak out on the reported attack. During an appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, per YouTube, Page got emotional when she was talking about attacks against the LGBTQ community, including the most recent news of an attack on Jussie Smollett. Page spoke through tears as she told Colbert that she was fired up about the whole thing.

“I’m like, really fired up right now. It feels impossible not to feel this way right now with the president and the Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married, let’s just be clear.”

She went on to say that the vice president is a man who wishes that she didn’t have the love that she has with her wife.

“He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana,” she told Colbert.

The actress also spoke out against Trump after it was reported that Smollett’s alleged attackers were Trump supporters whom purportedly yelled “This is MAGA country” during the attack. Page told the audience to “connect the dots,” claiming that the alleged attack which happened to Smollett occurs when people in a position of power hate certain people, and want to see them suffer.

As she ended her rant, she fought through tears to make her last point.

“I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f****** stop,” she said as the audience stood up and applauded her.

As the Inquisitr recently detailed, Smollett was reportedly subjected to racist and homophobic insults during an attack this past Tuesday in Chicago, as he claims that two masked men threw an unknown chemical substance at him. Additionally, the men purportedly put a rope around his neck before they fled the scene. There is also a surveillance video of Jussie walking into his apartment building with a rope around his neck.

The Chicago Police Department also released a video of two men walking in the area of the alleged attack about 15-20 minutes beforehand — and police are trying to locate those two individuals for questioning. Smollett’s family has since issued a statement on the claimed attack against their son, calling it a “racial, homophobic hate crime.”

Currently, there are no suspects in custody."

On Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two unidentified assailants who reportedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs at the actor, poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around Smollett's neck. Smollett later told police that the two men allegedly shouted ""This is MAGA Country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Numerous celebrities and activists have spoken out in support of Smollett. The actor himself also released a statement on Friday, the first public comments he made since being hospitalized. ""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,"" Smollett said, in part, to Essence. ""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

As governor of Indiana, Pence supported anti-gay legislation -- including, as reported by TIME, voting against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which ""would have banned discrimination against people based on sexual orientation."" Pence has also spoken out against gay marriage.

Page stars in The Umbrella Academy which debuts Friday, Feb. 8 on Netflix.

Smollett was attacked early Tuesday morning in a Chicago Subway restaurant by two men who beat him, allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs and said ""This is MAGA country,"" doused him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. The Chicago Police Department is investigating it as a possible hate crime and has released surveillance images of persons of interest.

Smollett's statement echoes many of the points made in his family's statement released on Thursday. ""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,"" the Smollett family said in part. ""Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.""

""I'm really fired up tonight,"" Page told host Stephen Colbert toward the end of their impassioned interview. ""It feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and the Vice President, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the government of Indiana. And I think the thing we need to know -- and I hope my show Gaycation did this in terms of connecting the dots what happened the other day to Jussie. I don't know him personally, I send him all of my love.""

Page continued with rising emotion, ""Connect the dots, this is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you wanna cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f--king stop.""

On Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two unidentified assailants who reportedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs at the actor, poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around Smollett's neck. Smollett later told police that the two men allegedly shouted ""This is MAGA Country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Numerous celebrities and activists have spoken out in support of Smollett. The actor himself also released a statement on Friday, the first public comments he made since being hospitalized. ""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,"" Smollett said, in part, to Essence. ""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

As governor of Indiana, Pence supported anti-gay legislation -- including, as reported by TIME, voting against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which ""would have banned discrimination against people based on sexual orientation."" Pence has also spoken out against gay marriage.

Page stars in The Umbrella Academy which debuts Friday, Feb. 8 on Netflix.

It reads: ""This was a racial, homophobic hate crime … We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings.""

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2am on Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

The Juno and Gaycation star fought back tears as she discussed the Donald Trump administration, specifically vice-president Mike Pence, and the Tuesday attack of gay Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

“It feels impossible not to feel this way right now with the president and the vice-president Mike Pence, who wishes I could not be married, let’s just be clear,” Page said to Colbert, referring to her wife Emma Portner. “The vice-president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.”

Referring to Pence’s policies, the 31-year-old said how the heightened political anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and the Smollett attack are interrelated; she claims you can “connect the dots” between any ostracizing political speech and anger against minority communities.

“If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?,” she said to Colbert, at one point even hitting his desk with her hand. “Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street.”

“I have travelled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet,” she said, referring to her nomadic show Gaycation, where she visits people in LGBTQ communities worldwide. “I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f**king stop.”

The “Empire” actor, whose statement was first published by Essence on Friday, said he was attacked in the early morning hours on Tuesday in what Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime.

Smollett addressed his statement to the “beautiful people.”

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” the actor said. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger.”

He went on to share his gratitude.

“More importantly I want to say thank you,” Smollett said. “The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

The star also addressed speculation that he has been less than forthcoming with authorities and that his story has changed since he originally reported the incident.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett added. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett said he was attacked by two people who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,” according to police.

Smollett plays a gay character on “Empire” and also identifies as gay.

He also reported that one of his attackers put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, police said.

Investigators said they have video of Smollett entering the hotel after the alleged attack with what appears to be a noose around his neck.

On Thursday, the Smollett family issued their first official statement since the incident.

They condemned the “violent and unprovoked attack,” calling it “a racial and homophobic hate crime.”

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning,” the family’s statement read. “His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,” Smollett said in his statement.

“I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,” he said. “We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.”

Smollett concluded with a message of resilience.

“Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love,” he said. “It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

CNN’s Don Lemon spoke to Smollett and a mutual friend who was at the hospital with the actor on Tuesday.

Smollett said he was shaken and angry that an attack like this could happen.

He also told CNN he fought back against the attackers.

Chicago police have released photos of potential persons of interest they are asking the public for assistance in identifying.

CNN’s Sandra Gonzalez and Ryan Young contributed to this report.

The statement was the first Smollett has made publicly about the alleged assault since media reports about it first surfaced on Tuesday. The matter is being investigated by Chicago police as a possible hate crime.

News of the bizarre incident spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested it was a hoax after police were unable to find videotape of the attack Smollett said he sustained.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett said in the statement.

Chicago police said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday the actor had refused to turn over his cellphone records to detectives, although law enforcement officials later said he was working with investigators.

Smollett and his manager have both told police they were on the phone together when the actor, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on “Empire,” was accosted on a street early on Tuesday by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett’s account, his assailants doused him with a chemical liquid before wrapping a rope around his neck and fleeing the scene. The actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police said.

Police said they sought phone records to independently verify that Smollett was on the phone at the time with his manager, who reportedly told police he heard the attackers saying “This is MAGA country” in an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

“Cellphone records were not provided to investigators when asked,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. “The victim didn’t provide them.”

However, he also said the police had “no reason to doubt” the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack.

Another police spokesman, Officer Michael Carroll, said in a later email: “The victim is working with police as we investigate the circumstances of the incident.”

Questions raised about the veracity of his account were troubling, Smollett said in his statement, especially since “these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender-conforming siblings daily.”

Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said some of the statements made by Chicago police sought to undermine the credibility of Smollett’s allegations.

“So far, Chicago Police have risked discouraging other survivors of hate crimes from coming forward,” said Clarke, whose organization seeks to secure equal justice for all.

Several dozen people attended a rally for Smollett in New York on Friday evening organized by gay rights groups.

Danielle Perkins, an 18-year-old Brooklyn resident who will soon be heading to college to study journalism, said she came to the rally because Smollett reminded her of what she described as her own sense of vulnerability.

“I think being gay and black in this country, it’s very difficult to get jobs, to live life, just to cross the street,” Perkins said. “It seems like we’re just going backwards to the ‘60s again.”"

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2am on Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

""I'm really fired up tonight,"" Page told host Stephen Colbert toward the end of their impassioned interview. ""It feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and the Vice President, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear.

Page continued with rising emotion, ""Connect the dots, this is what happens.

On Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two unidentified assailants who reportedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs at the actor, poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around Smollett's neck. Smollett later told police that the two men allegedly shouted ""This is MAGA Country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Numerous celebrities and activists have spoken out in support of Smollett. The actor himself also released a statement on Friday, the first public comments he made since being hospitalized. ""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,"" Smollett said, in part, to Essence. ""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

As governor of Indiana, Pence supported anti-gay legislation -- including, as reported by TIME, voting against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which ""would have banned discrimination against people based on sexual orientation."" Pence has also spoken out against gay marriage.

Page stars in The Umbrella Academy which debuts Friday, Feb. 8 on Netflix.

Last night, Ellen Page made an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and gave an incredibly personal, emotional interview, in which she called out the Trump Administration and particularly, Vice President Mike Pence, for their anti-LGBTQ policies and rhetoric. While it’s “impossible to not be fired up” in our country’s political climate, it’s imperative we “connect the dots” between the actions of people in power and the homophobic and racist attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett, an openly gay black man and LGBTQ+ activist.

“It feels impossible not to feel this way right now with the president and the Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I could not be married, let’s just be clear,” Ellen said. “The Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.”

The actress is no stranger to speaking out on behalf of LGBTQ+ rights, and has done so on multiple occasions, but she could barely hold back her tears as she spoke: ""If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street.”

Ellen is the star of Viceland’s Gaycation, a documentary series where she and friend Ian Daniel travel around the world exploring how different cultures treat the LGBTQ+ community in their country. “I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet,” she said. “I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.”"

The statement was the first Smollett has made publicly about the alleged assault since media reports about it first surfaced on Tuesday. The matter is being investigated by Chicago police as a possible hate crime.

News of the bizarre incident spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested it was a hoax after police were unable to find videotape of the attack Smollett said he sustained.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett said in the statement.

Chicago police said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday the actor had refused to turn over his cellphone records to detectives, although law enforcement officials later said he was working with investigators.

Smollett and his manager have both told police they were on the phone together when the actor, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on “Empire,” was accosted on a street early on Tuesday by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett’s account, his assailants doused him with a chemical liquid before wrapping a rope around his neck and fleeing the scene. The actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police said.

Police said they sought phone records to independently verify that Smollett was on the phone at the time with his manager, who reportedly told police he heard the attackers saying “This is MAGA country” in an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

“Cellphone records were not provided to investigators when asked,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. “The victim didn’t provide them.”

However, he also said the police had “no reason to doubt” the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack.

Another police spokesman, Officer Michael Carroll, said in a later email: “The victim is working with police as we investigate the circumstances of the incident.”

Questions raised about the veracity of his account were troubling, Smollett said in his statement, especially since “these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender-conforming siblings daily.”

Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said some of the statements made by Chicago police sought to undermine the credibility of Smollett’s allegations.

“So far, Chicago Police have risked discouraging other survivors of hate crimes from coming forward,” said Clarke, whose organization seeks to secure equal justice for all.

Several dozen people attended a rally for Smollett in New York on Friday evening organized by gay rights groups.

Danielle Perkins, an 18-year-old Brooklyn resident who will soon be heading to college to study journalism, said she came to the rally because Smollett reminded her of what she described as her own sense of vulnerability.

“I think being gay and black in this country, it’s very difficult to get jobs, to live life, just to cross the street,” Perkins said. “It seems like we’re just going backwards to the ‘60s again.”"

The Empire actor, who plays gay singer Jamal Lyon, was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago earlier this week, leaving him with a series of injuries.

Before Smollett released his statement, his family labelled the attack as ""racist, homophobic and domestic terrorism"".

The Sun reported his family pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

It reads: ""This was a racial, homophobic hate crime … We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings.""

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

The statement was the first Smollett has made publicly about the alleged assault since media reports about it first surfaced on Tuesday. The matter is being investigated by Chicago police as a possible hate crime.

News of the bizarre incident spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested it was a hoax after police were unable to find videotape of the attack Smollett said he sustained.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett said in the statement.

Chicago police said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday the actor had refused to turn over his cellphone records to detectives, although law enforcement officials later said he was working with investigators.

Smollett and his manager have both told police they were on the phone together when the actor, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on “Empire,” was accosted on a street early on Tuesday by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett’s account, his assailants doused him with a chemical liquid before wrapping a rope around his neck and fleeing the scene. The actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police said.

Police said they sought phone records to independently verify that Smollett was on the phone at the time with his manager, who reportedly told police he heard the attackers saying “This is MAGA country” in an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

“Cellphone records were not provided to investigators when asked,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. “The victim didn’t provide them.”

However, he also said the police had “no reason to doubt” the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack.

Another police spokesman, Officer Michael Carroll, said in a later email: “The victim is working with police as we investigate the circumstances of the incident.”

Questions raised about the veracity of his account were troubling, Smollett said in his statement, especially since “these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender-conforming siblings daily.”

Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said some of the statements made by Chicago police sought to undermine the credibility of Smollett’s allegations.

“So far, Chicago Police have risked discouraging other survivors of hate crimes from coming forward,” said Clarke, whose organization seeks to secure equal justice for all.

Several dozen people attended a rally for Smollett in New York on Friday evening organized by gay rights groups.

Danielle Perkins, an 18-year-old Brooklyn resident who will soon be heading to college to study journalism, said she came to the rally because Smollett reminded her of what she described as her own sense of vulnerability.

“I think being gay and black in this country, it’s very difficult to get jobs, to live life, just to cross the street,” Perkins said. “It seems like we’re just going backwards to the ‘60s again.”"

Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon in the US drama Empire, was recently attacked as he stepped out of a Subway restaurant in Chicago.

Suffering an alleged hate crime, it is reported that the 35-year-old was battered and covered in bleach, before having a noose wrapped around his neck.

Breaking his silence about the ordeal, the California-born lad spoke out in a statement to Essence.com today.

The director reassured everyone that he was OK and thanked everyone for all their support.

Showing off his strength of character, he addressed the world: “My body is strong but my soul is stronger.

“More importantly I want to thank you.”

Appreciating the support, Jussie shared: “The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more then I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Determined to get justice, the talented photographer expressed that he should not be looked at as an isolated incident as the ""cowardly attacks"" are happening to his sisters, brothers and ""non-gender conforming siblings"" daily.

Explaining that he will get back in touch with more details, Smollett said that he needed time to process it all.

Signing off, he declared: “During times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love.

“It’s all I know and that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Earlier today, his sister Jurnee Smollett-Bell confirmed that the attack was driven by race and homophobic motives in a heartfelt statement on Instagram.

Sharing a picture with her 1.1 million followers of their whole family smiling away, the 32-year-old actress spoke of the hate crimes that happen daily across their country.

Leaving an inspiring and positive message about her brother, she wrote: “Because there’s a light in him that cannot be dimmed because we are a family of joyful warriors we will not let this get this best of us.

“Although this is a picture from happier times this is the spirit to which we chose to move forward… they will not steal our joy.”"

The Canadian-born actress, who married her wife Emma Portner last year, was on the talk show to promote her new Netflix show, ""The Umbrella Academy."" However, the conversation turned to how anti-LGBTQ views by the two American leaders have helped give rise to more hate crimes in the U.S.

""I'm really fired up tonight but it feels impossible not to feel this way right now with the president and the vice-president, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear, the vice-president of America wishes I didn't have the love [I have] with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana,"" said Page, who accused Pence of attacking the LGBTQ community while he was governor of Indiana.

Watch: Ellen Page calls out hateful leadership. Story continues below.

""He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana. I think the thing we need to know, and I hope my show 'Gaycation' did this, in terms of connecting the dots between what happened with Jussie — I don't know him personally, I send him all of my love — [is how to] connect the dots. This is what happens if you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them. You go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering.""

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, 35, was attacked earlier this week in what was allegedly a homophobic and racist incident in Chicago. Police have said that two unknown assailants allegedly approached Smollett, yelling out racial and homophobic slurs before assaulting him and fleeing the scene. Smollett said in a statement to E! News on Friday that he was OK.

""What do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves. People are going to be beaten on the street. I have travelled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I'm lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop,"" said the 31-year-old star of films ""Juno"" and ""Inception.""

And there is truth to Page's assertion: Loyola University Chicago School of Law professor Stephen Rushin and University of Alabama at Birmingham economics professor Griffin Sims Edwards conducted a study last year that found that Trump's rise to power was associated with ""a statistically significant surge in reported hate crimes across the United States.""

Page, who was born and raised in Halifax, also spoke about the looming dangers of climate change and environmental racism.

She said that environmental degradation ""disproportionately affects people of colour,"" and pointed to cases in Nova Scotia to make her point.

Page told Colbert that there's ""a pulp mill in Pictou, N.S. that's been there forever and has destroyed the environment and the land of the First Nations people."""

""Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.""

That's the first thing Jussie Smollett wants supporters to know following reports that two men attacked him in Chicago. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger,"" the African-American gay actor tells Essence. The Empire star says he is fully cooperating with police and ""despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.” Police have made no arrests in the case but are looking for two people of interest spotted on surveillance video. ""He’s a victim,"" police chief Eddie Johnson tells NBC Chicago, adding that Smollett has ""been very cooperative with us.""

The actor says two men assaulted him about 2am Tuesday, dousing him with a liquid believed to be bleach, telling him he's in ""MAGA country,"" and putting a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Smollett went to the hospital and has since been discharged. The actor was reportedly on the phone with his manager when the attack took place, though he has declined to hand over his phone. The police chief says he will not force the issue. ""We don't treat him like a criminal,"" says Johnson. (Days before the attack, someone sent Smollett white powder in the mail.)

""I'm really fired up tonight,"" Page told host Stephen Colbert toward the end of their impassioned interview. ""It feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and the Vice President, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife.

And I think the thing we need to know -- and I hope my show Gaycation did this in terms of connecting the dots what happened the other day to Jussie. I don't know him personally, I send him all of my love.""

Page continued with rising emotion, ""Connect the dots, this is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you wanna cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f--king stop.""

On Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two unidentified assailants who reportedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs at the actor, poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around Smollett's neck. Smollett later told police that the two men allegedly shouted ""This is MAGA Country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Numerous celebrities and activists have spoken out in support of Smollett. The actor himself also released a statement on Friday, the first public comments he made since being hospitalized. ""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,"" Smollett said, in part, to Essence. ""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

As governor of Indiana, Pence supported anti-gay legislation -- including, as reported by TIME, voting against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which ""would have banned discrimination against people based on sexual orientation."" Pence has also spoken out against gay marriage.

Empire Co-Creator Lee Daniels, Fox Respond to Jussie Smollett Racist Attack

Smollett was attacked early Tuesday morning in a Chicago Subway restaurant by two men who beat him, allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs and said ""This is MAGA country,"" doused him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. The Chicago Police Department is investigating it as a possible hate crime and has released surveillance images of persons of interest.

Washington, DC - Remarks by President Trump at Signing of Executive Order, “Strengthening Buy-American Preferences for Infrastructure Projects”

THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. I’m honored to be here with many of the great American workers as we take historic action to accelerate the incredible revival of American manufacturing. It truly is a revival. Nobody thought it was possible, actually. And not only is it possible, but we’re thriving.

We’re also grateful to be joined by Secretary Acosta, Administrator McMahon, and Representative Robert Aderholt, Mario Diaz-Balart. And we’re working on a lot of interesting projects in your neck of the woods, aren’t we, huh? How’s that all going?

REPRESENTATIVE DIAZ-BALART: Mr. President, you are a champion of freedom in this country.

THE PRESIDENT: I didn’t expect that. I never told him to say that. (Laughter.) Well, that was a great move. Every once in a while (inaudible). (Laughter.) And you too, that I can tell you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Robert Aderholt. Robert, thank you very much. David Joyce, Anthony Gonzalez, and David Rouzer. Thank you all for being here. We really worked hard on this. And I appreciate your support.

In the eight years before I took office, we lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs. They were leaving. People were talking about the fact that you needed a magic wand; you’ll never bring them back. You remember the previous administration, he said that they said — he said — they all said you needed a magic wand; manufacturing jobs were over. I guess you people heard that too. It was a little bit discouraging.

And since the election, we’ve gained more than 500,000 jobs — and that number is going to be very soon to 700,000 jobs — all in the manufacturing world, which is a beautiful world, a high-paying world, and very important for our country.

Last year, we saw the biggest increase in manufacturing employment in more than 20 years. Early in my presidency, I issued an executive order directing the federal government to live by two very crucial rules: Buy American and hire American. And I think that sounds appropriate. Remember in the old days? It was not that. It was almost the opposite. You’d say, “Where are they coming from?”

Thanks to my executive order and a really great group of people, we have increased reliance on American-made goods very, very substantially. Federal agencies are now spending an additional $24 billion on American-made products instead of going to other countries or foreign-made products.

Federal spending on foreign goods is now the lowest it’s been in more than 10 years, and it’s going down very substantially. And, by the way, we don’t get treated great by many countries in terms of our trade deals, and that’s changing rapidly. But we are now looking out a little bit for ourselves and it’s about time.

Today, I’m taking action to build on this tremendous success by strengthening the Buy American principle for federal infrastructure and federal spending.

We want American roads, bridges, and railways, and everything else to be built with American iron, American steel, American concrete, and American hands. And if you look at what’s happened with the steel industry, it’s actually amazing. The steel industry is thriving now and it was dead when I came to office. It was dead. It was a dead industry. They were dumping steel all over the place. The jobs were going. And if any of you were in the steel industry, I think you can probably tell them, you know. And aluminum, too.

But when you look at what’s happened to the steel industry, it’s been incredible. One of the great successes. And now prices are starting to come down because they’re competing with each other. Nucor and U.S. Steel and so many of these companies, they’re building many, many plants all over the United States. And as those plants open, they’re finally competing with themselves.

We literally were not going to have steel companies. We weren’t going to make steel in this country. And that in itself is a very important thing. We have to have steel. There are some products you have to have. And, by the way, steel is one of them.

You talked about defense — how do you do it without steel and aluminum and the kinds of things that we’re really very heavily focused on.

By signing this order today, we renew our commitment to an essential truth: It matters where something is made, and it matters very greatly.

When I came to office, and I witnessed for many years — for decades, frankly — they didn’t care where it was made. I care where it’s made. It should be made right here in the USA. And we’ve taken a very strong stand.

I want to introduce, before I sign, Peter Navarro and Kevin Hassett, two of my great economic people. And they’re going to give you a little talk as to what’s happened and how good we’re doing.

Peter, do you want to start?

MR. NAVARRO: Thank you, Mr. President. I remember back during the campaign, the naysayers said that this President could not restore the manufacturing base.

I’m just going to show you a couple pictures here. What we have here is a chart that shows the loss of 192,000 jobs during the eight years of the Obama administration. It did tick up a little bit during Obama’s last two years: 73,000. But it is absolutely dwarfed by the policies of this President: 473,000 since Inauguration Day, and over 500,000 since the election.

And then you can see how the emphasis is on this administration in putting men and women who work with their hands to work. You can see the jobs created in the Obama administration: One percent of the total job gains were manufacturing compared to 10 percent.

And the folks here that you see on the President’s right come from across this great country, and they build essentially the mother’s milk of Americana. It’s lamppost, it’s fire hydrants, it’s water mains. And we salute these workers today coming in this White House.

Kevin is going to show you another chart that shows how these distribution of manufacturing gains are across this country, and then we’ll kick it back to Mr. President.

CHAIRMAN HASSETT: And again, the economics literature, Mr. President, when you were running for office basically said that manufacturing was going the way of agriculture in the previous century; that it was just on an inevitable decline as a percentage of GDP. But it also focused a lot on this idea that there was a rust belt in America. There was a place where there used to be manufacturing, where there was disproportionate harm to workers.

And I think the thing that’s really, really interesting about the manufacturing jobs that have been created by our policies — your policies — are that they’re scattered throughout America. The dark red part is a place where manufacturing jobs are up by 20 percent or more since you last took office.

THE PRESIDENT: Wow. That’s fantastic.

CHAIRMAN HASSETT: And then the lighter reds are 10 percent or more. And the lightest red is 5 percent or more.

But if you look at all the pockets all across the country, including in places that people used to call the Rust Belt, where manufacturing employment is booming, what it means is that there’s basically a boom belt from coast to coast that’s been created by our policies.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know, Kevin, when I took over, the Rust Belt was really in trouble. Many people were saying it’s dying, it’s dead; people were leaving. And I love the Rust Belt, and the Rust Belt is no longer the Rust Belt as far as I’m concerned. It’s vibrant. It’s doing so well. You look at all of those red marks, those red marks are where it’s flourishing. Tremendous numbers. And that’s fantastic. We’re very proud.

I wish, frankly, that the media would report how well we’re doing in manufacturing, how well we’re doing with the economy. They don’t seem to report how well we’re doing. I think if you had another President, it would be the biggest story, because it really is the biggest story, or certainly one of the biggest stories. And you see the market, how it is. It hit 25,000 yesterday. We’re doing great. We’re doing great as a country.

And we have a lot of bite-back because other countries are not doing well. China is having a very hard time. They’re here now. We’re going to be seeing them a little bit later. We’re trying to work out a new trade deal with China. I think it will happen. Something will happen. But it’s a very big deal. It will be — if it does happen, it will be, by far, the largest trade deal ever made.

And we essentially didn’t have a trade deal with China. We lost $500 billion with China, for many years, a year. Anywhere from $300- to $500-, $505 billion a year was lost in our dealing with China. And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, and I think we’ll sit down at the end — at the end of the negotiation by our representatives — and do something with respect to making a deal with China. I think it has a very good chance of happening.

But China is having a very hard time with their economy, and the European Union is having a hard time. A lot of things going on. And we’re getting tremendous numbers. Tremendous unemployment numbers — among the best we’ve ever had in the history of our country. Individual groups the best: African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women. Numbers that we haven’t seen before. The overall is the best numbers. Best employment numbers in 51 years.

So we’re doing really well. I wish the press would report it.

I’m going to sign this. Before I do, I think I want to just ask a few of you folks, would you like to say something? Anybody? Anybody want to become a congressman by (inaudible)?

MR. MULLER: Mr. President, I’d like to thank you for the tax cuts. It’s been rocket fuel for our business for manufacturing.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. That was great. Charlie? That was great.

MR. FORTNEY: Mr. President, I’d like to thank you for the — this Buy American push that you’ve got with federal funding for the infrastructure that’s Buy American. It’s jobs for us. And it puts us in a position where we can compete. Otherwise, we tend to walk to away from jobs where foreign competition is going to take our business.

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We’re changing that fast.

MR. FORTNEY: Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT: Big difference. Big difference.

MS. HARRISON: And I’m with McWane, in Birmingham. We’re based out of Birmingham, Alabama. We have seen a tremendous uptick. We’re representing several divisions with McWane here, but thank you for everything you’ve done.

THE PRESIDENT: That’s great. Great group. Thank you. Thank you all very much. You want to say anything? Anybody else?

Anybody want to become a congressperson?

MS. MARTINEZ: Just that it gives us an opportunity to hire, obviously even more opportunities that we have to fill positions as jobs increase.

MR. FORTNEY: That’s Brenda Martinez with U.S. Foundry. She’s our HR, and she hires people when we get more work.

THE PRESIDENT: Big difference. Right?

MS. MARTINEZ: Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all very much.

So how about our politicians? Now, they want to say, that I know. (Laughter.) These people — they’re not shy.

REPRESENTATIVE ADERHOLT: Well, let me say, first of all, that this is a very commonsense, a bipartisan piece of executive order that the President — we have worked on legislation in the past that’s worked this from the appropriations side from year to year.

But what this executive order does, it goes beyond that and it really tries to make sure that we — as the President said, American hands are doing the job and this is what we’re — when we go back home, we want to see our manufacturers do well. We want to see them grow. We want to see our workers do — have better jobs. So thanks, Mr. President, for doing it. So, thank you.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Appreciate it.

MR. NAVARRO: Mr. President, if I may — this gentleman here has been a long-time leader on the hill carrying the Buy American banner, and his leadership is very much appreciated.

THE PRESIDENT: That’s why he wins by so much.

MR. NAVARRO: Yes. That is correct. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: That’s why he doesn’t worry too much about races. You know? Just wins.

REPRESENTATIVE ADERHOLT: It helps when you’ve got a district that he wins about 80 percent. So — (laughter).

THE PRESIDENT: I think I did very well. (Laughter.) Come to think of it.

REPRESENTATIVE ADERHOLT: The best of 435 districts, so —

THE PRESIDENT: That’s great. That’s very nice. Thank you very much. Say hello.

Linda?

ADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: Well, thank you very much. I hear from small businesses, you know, all over the country, and they are very happy to be buying American and hiring American. And, you know, the job growth, it just speaks for itself. And our businesses are growing and starting and expanding.

THE PRESIDENT: Great job you’re doing too. She runs the Small Business, and they’re big business when you add it all up. She’s done a fantastic job — Linda McMahon.

Mr. Secretary?

SECRETARY ACOSTA: Mr. President, you know, in the past, we’ve encouraged individuals out there to buy American. But what you’re doing is so important because you’re leading by example. You’re saying the federal government will buy American. And we’ve seen the impact last year with, you know, a 10-year record low in foreign purchases. And this is going to take it to the next step, and it will translate into more jobs for individuals, just like those here today.

THE PRESIDENT: It’s having an incredible effect. I mean, people don’t realize it yet, but they’re seeing it more and more. We are mandating even pipelines and things that were made elsewhere. They’re starting to be made here because we have a steel industry again. But it’s having a tremendous effect.

Please.

REPRESENTATIVE JOYCE: Thank you, Mr. President, I have been co-sponsoring a bill for years with Daniel Lipinski. Couldn’t get it to go anywhere. I’m honored that you’re doing it today to force it into action because, as you said, these are American jobs. It’s American concrete, it’s American steel, it’s American asphalt. Thank you for doing so.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

REPRESENTATIVE ROUZER: Well, Mr. President, you can’t believe how much my folks back home in Eastern North Carolina appreciate your commitment to the American worker, and particularly the American farmer. And I personally really appreciate you taking it to China. They have eaten our lunch for a long, long time, and I appreciate you standing up and really fighting hard for our American workers, and the job creation that’s going to result from that. And keep plugging for America’s farmers.

THE PRESIDENT: So China, as you know, has opened up because of us to the financial services industry, which is a big thing. Nobody thought that was possible. And they’ve opened up to financial services and things of the like.

But I just want to let everyone know we won’t have a deal if we don’t open it up to the farmers, and we won’t have a deal if they don’t open it up to our manufacturers, and just all of it. And I think China is very prone to do this. So we’re going to have a talk. But we’ve already got financial services. A big impact. You have tremendous amounts of money. Tremendous amounts of people. It’s a whole different market, and a massive market. I guess you could certainly say the biggest, or one of the biggest markets in the world, but maybe the biggest market in a certain way in the world.

But we’re the number-one country in the world economically. I don’t want people to forget that. We’re the number one. And we were heading — we were heading south fast. We were going down, and we turned it around. And it started with the regulations that we cut. We cut more regulations than any administration in the history of our country in two years. And, actually, less than two years. And it also was helped by the tax cuts. Put a lot of people to work and really gave companies something where they’re now coming back into our country, they’re investing in our country, and they’re expanding in our country.

So, a lot of great things are happening.

Mario?

REPRESENTATIVE DIAZ-BALART: Mr. President, I, again, it’s amazing what leadership does. The economy is booming, you’re rebuilding our military, you’re leading around the world. Enough said.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I’m liking this guy more and more. (Laughter.)

REPRESENTATIVE ADERHOLT: Let me just add one thing that I have — this makes my 22nd year serving in the House of Representatives. This President has stood up more for manufacturing jobs in Alabama and across the country — not just Alabama — than any President. So I thank you for standing up.

MR. NAVARRO: And Robert and Mario have been leaders on the Reciprocal Trade Act, as well, that you’re sponsoring.

THE PRESIDENT: I know. Reciprocal trade is going be very important. We’re going putting in a bill very soon, where when a country charges us tariffs that are massive, and we charge them nothing for the same exact product, we just say, “Hey, got to be equal. You charge us, we charge you.” You could call it a reciprocal tax, but some people call it a mirror tax.

So, if Europe, as an example — the EU charges us 72 percent tariff on corn, and they don’t even want it, and we charge them nothing — it doesn’t work that way anymore. So, you know, I’ve gone to many people that aren’t that familiar with it, including politicians that you’ll be dealing with soon. And I went to a couple that are always tough. I said, “What do you think of that? They charge us, we charge them.” They looked at me and they said, Robert, “Huh. Sounds fair to me.”

And, actually, you probably get rid of tariffs, because rather than charging 75 percent to nothing, now if you’re both at 75, you say, “Let’s call it quits. We’ll go to nothing.”

So it really has that impact too, as you know. Please.

REPRESENTATIVE GONZALEZ: Thank you, Mr. President. So, as you know, northeast Ohio is all about jobs and the economy. And Dave and I are from the same neck of the woods. And to see the cranes, buildings going up, to see steel jobs coming back — to your point, they said it couldn’t be done, and now wages are going up. When was the last time real wages went up? It’s been a while. So keep doing what you’re doing, and we support you in northeast Ohio on everything with the economy.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

REPRESENTATIVE GONZALEZ: So, thank you.

THE PRESIDENT: And they’re getting — it’s a beautiful thing because I opened up, as you know — the best iron ore, they say, virtually in the world is in Minnesota. The big mines. They were closed. President Obama decided to close them. I opened them. And we’re not bringing it in; we’re taking it right from our own home. And we’re having it made in Ohio. We have good ore in Ohio, too. But we’re having it made in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, and all the different places. It’s been really incredible to see what’s happening. We don’t need anything from outside of our own boundaries. So that’s been really great.

Okay, let’s go. (Laughter.) Does anybody want this pen? Thank you very much. Thank you all for being here. I appreciate it.

(The executive order is signed.)

Okay, here you go. (Applause.) Thank you, everybody, very much. I appreciate it.

Q Mr. President, (inaudible) your intelligence officials yesterday. Do you still have confidence in Gina Haspel and Dan Coats to give you good advice?

THE PRESIDENT: No, I disagree with certain things that they said. I think I’m right, but time will prove that. Time will prove me right, probably. I think Iran is a threat. I think it’s a very big threat. And I think I did a great thing when I terminated the ridiculous Iran nuclear deal. It was a horrible, one-sided deal that was $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash, and lots of other bad things.

If you remember, they took our 10 sailors out of waters that people are disputing, and made us look very bad. But, of course, the payment was due the following day, so they eventually let them go, which they had to. I disagree very much on that.

I also think — and you’ll be seeing something next week — because you look at what’s happened in Syria with respect to ISIS and the caliphate. We took over a lot of area in the last two weeks. We’ve done tremendous in the last couple of weeks. At the same time, we’re consolidating, and a tremendous amount of good things are happening.

You even look at what’s going on — and I can’t tell you that this is a guarantee because we’re going into close to 19 years in being in Afghanistan. And, for the first time, they’re talking about settling. They’re talking about making an agreement. And we bring our people back home if that happens. We’ll see what happens, but they’re in very serious negotiations for the first time. There’s a reason for that.

So I think we’re doing so well on a foreign policy basis. If you look at North Korea — and many of you are going to be traveling with us to North Korea and — for the meetings with North Korea. We’re going to a certain location. I think most of you know where the location is. I don’t think it’s any great secret. But we’ll be announcing the location and the date — the exact date. It will be at the end of February. And we’ve made tremendous progress with North Korea.

When I came in — or, let’s say, at the end of the last administration — frankly, it looked like we were going to war with North Korea. Now there’s no missile testing. There’s no rocket testing. There’s no nuclear testing. We got back our prisoners or our hostages. And we’re getting back our remains; they’re coming in. And we’ve had some beautiful ceremonies in Hawaii, other places.

So I just tell you that we are doing really well. Our military is being rebuilt. It’s very close to being rebuilt. We have tremendous amounts of new aircraft, new ships, new weapons of all kinds, which we need — because, hopefully, the stronger we get, the less you have to use it. I guess you know that from growing up in school. The stronger we are, the less we’re going to have you use it, and we don’t want to have to use it. But we’re going to have the strongest military, by far, that we’ve ever had.

So I didn’t see the report from the intelligence. When you read it, it’s a lot different than it was covered on in the news. But I think that Iran is somebody — is a nation that we have to watch very closely. They sent up a rocket the other day, and it failed. But it was sent up. Now, they can say they’re sending it up for civilian purposes, but I don’t think too many people believe that. They’re doing tests. And we don’t want to be in a position where we’re behind. We’re not going to be leading from behind anymore.

So that’s the story. I have great respect for a lot of people, but I don’t always agree with everybody. Okay?

Q What concessions has China made so far in the talks? Anything on IP theft?

THE PRESIDENT: So, it’s great. Well, we’re going to — look, we’re going to go into everything. You probably saw, this morning I put out a statement. We’re going into everything. This isn’t going to be a small deal with China. This is either going to be a very big deal or it’s going to be a deal that we’ll just postpone for a little while.

But we’ve been dealing with China. We’ve had a great relationship. I have a great relationship with President Xi. The relationship of my people to Chinese representatives has been very good. They’re negotiating now. They’ll be coming over here at about 4 o’clock, and we’ll be talking to, actually, one of the top leaders in China, as you know.

I think that probably the final deal will be made. If it’s made, will be made between myself and President Xi. But we’re certainly talking about theft. We’re talking about every aspect of trade with a country. And we’re talking about fentanyl, too.

As you know, most of the fentanyl — which is killing 80,000 Americans a year is — it comes through China. And, in China, it was not criminalized. And they’ve agreed to criminalize fentanyl and give it the maximum penalty. The maximum penalty in China, if you’re selling drugs, is death; it’s the death penalty. And they’ve agreed to do the death penalty for selling fentanyl. And if it’s shipped to the United States, that would be a very severe penalty.

So I think that’s going to have a tremendous impact. We put that one item into the trade deal — the fentanyl. I think that’s a very important item to put in. But they’ve agreed — they’ve agree, and agreed very readily — we really appreciate it — to criminalize the sale of fentanyl.

Steve?

Q Do you think you’ll make the March 1 deadline?

THE PRESIDENT: I don’t know. I mean, it’s —

Q And you are going to add (inaudible)?

THE PRESIDENT: I can tell you, there’s — a lot of people are working. What happens — we’re charging large tariffs to Chinese products that are coming in, which hurts China. As you know — you saw the reports — out of the 25 points, we’re paying for four points out of the 25. They’re paying for 21. That’s a big difference. I’ve always said that.

We’re taking in billions of dollars. And, frankly, we’re creating a lot of industry. But the rate goes from 10 percent to 25 percent on March 1st. So they would like to do it, and I’d like to accommodate them. If we can, I’d like to accommodate China if we can get the deal done.

It’s a lot of work because this is a very comprehensive deal. This isn’t what we’re talking about, you know, they’re going to buy some corn and that’s going to be it. No, they’re going to buy corn. Hopefully, they’re going to buy lots of corn, and lots of wheat, and lots of everything else that we have. But they’re also talking heavy technology, heavy manufacturing, financial services, and everything else.

Q So you may have to extend the talks beyond March the 1st? Is that what you’re saying, sir?

THE PRESIDENT: I think we can do it by March 1st. Can you get it down on paper by March 1st? I don’t know. I can say, on March 1st, the tariff on China goes to 25 percent, and that’s a big tariff.

Q I’m just curious, what’s the tone looking like for the State of the Union, sir? And then, I don’t know if you’ve seen, the Democrats have tapped the rebuttal speech — Stacey Abrams, who ran for Governor of Georgia. Any thoughts on their pick, sir, or any of the messaging?

THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I campaigned against Stacey Abrams. I know that President Obama campaigned for her. Michelle Obama campaigned for her. And Oprah campaigned for her. And all Brian had was me. And he won fairly easily — you know, fairly easy.

So I hope that she does a good job. I mean, I respect her. I don’t know her. I haven’t met her. But I hope she does a good job.

Q And the tone for your speech, sir — can you tell us —

THE PRESIDENT: I think it’s unification. I think it’s industry. I think it’s about the people that you see right here. It’s also working with these people, because they’ve been incredible. We have had some incredible report. And we’ve have incredible Republican support.

The problem is, the Democrats — you know, when they say, “We don’t want to build…” — as an example, “We don’t want to build a wall because it doesn’t work or because it’s immoral.” Well, it’s also immoral the people that come into our country that shouldn’t be here and kill people. That’s immoral, too. That’s a lot more immoral.

So — but I really think it’s doing to be a speech that’s going to cover a lot of territory. But part of it is going to be unity.

Yeah, please.

Q Mr. President, Nancy Pelosi said this morning that there is not going to be a wall in this deal, but she did say she’d be open to other kinds of physical barriers. Would you accept that?

THE PRESIDENT: No, because if there’s no wall, it doesn’t work. She’s just playing games. So if there’s no wall, it doesn’t work.

And we’re building the wall right now. I mean, a lot of people don’t know that, but we have a lot of wall under construction. We’ve given out a lot of contracts over the last three, four weeks — good contracts. A lot of wall is soon going to be under construction.

We will be — we’re finishing up design on certain areas, the most important areas — the Rio Grande area and others. We are building a lot of wall. You know, I’m not waiting for this committee. And I’ve told a lot of people I don’t expect much coming out of the committee because I keep hearing the words that, “We’ll give you what you want, but we’re not going to give you wall.”

The problem is, if they don’t give us a wall, it doesn’t work. Without a wall, it doesn’t work. We have caravans right now coming up from Honduras, who we give a lot of money to — which is stopping, by the way. But we pay hundreds of millions of dollars to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. And then they have caravans leaving their country, coming up here.

And, by the way, if you go to Tijuana and you take down that wall, you will have so many people coming into our country that Nancy Pelosi will be begging for a wall. She’ll be begging for a wall. She will say, “Mr. President, please, please give us a wall.” It’d be very interesting. Some people have suggested: Let me take the wall along California, let’s move it to Arizona, let’s move it to Texas. And, you know, it’s going to — it would be a very interesting statement.

About Nancy: So, in California, they wanted the wall built in San Diego so badly. And we built it. And probably I should have waited, because as soon as it was finished, they started screaming, “We don’t want a wall. We don’t want a wall.” But they wanted the wall so badly. And, by the way, it worked. Nobody is getting through.

But the minute it was built, they started saying, “We don’t want a wall.” Without a wall, it doesn’t work. It’s very simple. I mean, I’m not saying this as a Republican. I’m not saying it as anything other than a fact-stater. Without a wall, it just doesn’t work.

Q Mr. President, after listening to the hardship from many federal government workers, as well as those who were contractors and who relied on the federal government employees’ finances to fund their businesses, are you willing to jeopardize the economy again, and also your presidency, with people who are fearful of another government shutdown over this wall?

And also, I want to ask you about Jussie Smollett. Have you heard about that story? In Chicago, a situation — the actor from “Empire” who was allegedly attacked with racist and homophobic —

THE PRESIDENT: That, I can tell you, is horrible. I’ve seen it last night. I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.

As far as the people are concerned, many of those people wanted me to stay out, but I didn’t want to do it because people were getting hurt.

People — what I think is the worst sin of all is the fact that we’re allowing people to come into this country and sell drugs and human traffic, and do all of these horrible things. That if we had the simplicity of a well-constructed, beautiful barrier or wall, they wouldn’t be able to come into our country. That, to me, is the great sin. And everybody knows it works. I watched this morning, early in the morning, somebody trying to justify walls are immoral.

I mean, if walls are immoral, maybe we should take down all the walls that are built right now. You will see a mess like you’ve never seen before.

So I only say this: I was elected partially on this issue — not as much as people say, but partially on this issue. This is a very important issue. Nothing to do with elections. Nothing to do with votes. Nothing. Only to do with common sense and only to do with security. And if we don’t put up a barrier or wall — a strong one, but one that looks good — in the old days, they used to build them; they looked terrible. Now we build them, they look really good.

If we don’t put up a physical barrier, you can forget it. Our country is going to be a very unsafe place. People are coming in. Drugs are coming in. Human trafficking is coming in, which is so horrible. Things are happening that won’t happen after the wall is constructed.

So we’re building a lot of wall. We’re building new sections that are starting in about two weeks. We’re building some brand new sections — large sections. And the wall is getting built. I would like to build it even faster, but it’s getting built, and it’s getting built very substantially, as some of you see because you’ve been there.

Yeah, please.

Q I have an immigration question. But first, if I could just clarify something you said about North Korea. Do you have an agreement with North Korea on the time and place for that next summit?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes. I do.

Q Can you share it?

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we’re going to very soon. We’re going to announce it pretty soon. We’ll be announcing it early next week.

Q Okay. And you also said that —

THE PRESIDENT: And they very much want the meeting, and I think they really want to do something. We’ll see. But I think they really want.

But again, remember, North Korea was a whole different story. When I came to office, many people thought we were going to war with North Korea. I would sit and listen, and I would read people saying, “Go to war with North Korea.” Well, you’d lose, I mean potentially, hundreds of millions of lives. You know, Seoul has 30-some-odd million people, and it’s literally right off their wall, by the way. But that wall works, I can tell you.

Q About the wall, you just said that people make that out to be a bigger deal on your election than you —

THE PRESIDENT: Well, it was one of my points. I had — yeah.

Q I mean, you would consider that the biggest campaign —

THE PRESIDENT: Now they say it’s the wall, because I’ve accomplished practically everything else. Look, I accomplished the military. I accomplished the tax cuts. I accomplished the regulation cuts. I accomplished so much. The economy is the number-one economy in the world. We’re the number-one economy in the world. We’re the number one, not even close. Companies are pouring into our country.

I’ve accomplished so much. So now they say, “Oh, if he doesn’t get the wall…” — they make that the only issue. But it’s not going to work, because I’m building the wall. The wall is happening right now, okay?

Q The government has been reopened for several days now. Are you closer or farther apart on an immigration deal, now that — since you opened the government?

THE PRESIDENT: With respect to the committee?

Q Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: I would say we’re the same. Because I’m hearing they don’t want to do a wall, for political reasons. I actually think it’s bad politics. I mean, frankly, I think them fighting us on what everybody knows has to be done to have proper security.

And you can add the other things, but the other things only really work if you have the physical barrier. Without the physical barrier, you just won’t — what are you going to have? Drones flying over the 12,000 people? You’re going to have a nice drone flying — doing circles around the 12,000 people that are walking in from Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador? No, you don’t want that.

So I want to do real things, like the deal with China. I want it to be a real deal. I could do a deal with China, where people would say, “Isn’t that wonderful?” It’s not wonderful. I have to do the real deal. We have to open up China. We’re open to them. They have to be open to us.

So, it would be so easy for me to make a deal with China, but it wouldn’t be a real deal. I could get them to buy more corn than they’ve ever bought, and more soybeans than they’ve ever bought. And they’d be so happy if I did that. But they’re going to do that, but in even higher numbers. But we’re going to do a lot of other things.

And just remember, we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from China. We never took in 10 cents from China. China is being charged tremendous amounts of money for the privilege of coming in and doing what they do to our country. They’re being charged a tremendous amount of money. And we’re going to make a deal. I think we’re going to make a deal with China, but it’s going to be a very comprehensive deal. We’re going to cover everything, okay

Q You mentioned all the economic indicators are going up. Why then is the — are U.S. deficits and the financial debt increasing at a time when the economy is —

THE PRESIDENT: Well, the trade deals won’t kick in for a while. You know, number one, the USMCA hasn’t even been approved yet. It has to go before Congress and get approved. Now, it should get approved quickly. NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. During the campaign, I said I will either terminate NAFTA or negotiate a new deal. And we negotiated a good deal.

Now, if you went back to pre-NAFTA, that would be, frankly, okay with me. Pre-NAFTA or the new deal. But I won’t allow NAFTA. NAFTA was a horrible deal for this country. If you look at the scars all over our country, where you go to New England, you go to Ohio, you go to Pennsylvania, you see what — I mean, what happened in North Carolina — you have factories that are still empty from what happened with NAFTA. NAFTA was a horrible deal. The USMCA is a great deal.

But pre-NAFTA was — we had huge surpluses with Mexico. With NAFTA, we have huge deficits. We lose $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico. Does that sound good? And this has been going on for many years. So I stopped it. I stopped it a lot.

Q One more on the wall. You said the wall is being basically held hostage for political reasons by the Democrats. Is there anything you would have done differently in the first two years to get this —

THE PRESIDENT: No, there’s nothing — look, they had this from day one.

Q — (inaudible) wall finished —

THE PRESIDENT: Could I have done it differently? No, not really. I mean, I think what — by having the shutdown, we’ve set the table for where we are now. If I didn’t do the shutdown, people wouldn’t know — they wouldn’t understand the subject. Now they understand the subject. They realize what a humanitarian crisis it is.

It’s sort of — it’s called, like in deal-making, “setting the table,” or, you know, setting the stage. We’ve set the stage for what’s going to happen on the 15th of February. I don’t think they’re going to make a deal. I see what’s happening. They’re all saying, “Oh, let’s do this, but we’re not giving one dime for the wall.” That’s okay. But if they’re not going to give money for the wall, it’s not going to work. And if it’s not going to work, then the politicians are really wasting a lot of time.

Okay.

Q Mr. President, will you declare a national emergency if there’s no money for the wall?

THE PRESIDENT: I would do that. I would do that.

Q So why hasn’t —

THE PRESIDENT: We have money. Just so you understand: We have money. We’re building the wall right now — a lot of it. People don’t know that, and nobody reports it, but that’s okay. Because it’s not very exciting when you say it’s built. You know, people.

But let me just tell you: We’re building the wall right now. It’s going up fairly rapidly. We’re renovating tremendous amounts of wall, which is good stuff that’s in very bad shape with massive holes in it and fencing coming down. It’s being beautifully renovated. In some cases, we have to replace it. We renovate some. We replace some. We build some new. But the wall is going up right now in all different forms.

Thank you very much, everybody.

Q What’s been holding you back from declaring a national emergency?

THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to see what happens on February 15th.

Q Are you concerned about legal challenges?

THE PRESIDENT: Against who?

Q Are you concerned about legal challenges?

THE PRESIDENT: No, I’m not concerned. I’m not concerned.

Q But you still don’t think there’s going to be a deal, but you’re not going to declare it now. Don’t you think that —

THE PRESIDENT: I’m waiting — excuse me. I didn’t say that. I said I’m waiting until February 15th. On February 15th, the committee will come back, and if they don’t have a wall, I don’t even want to waste my time reading what they have because it’s a waste of time. Because the only thing that works for security and safety for our country is a wall.

Now, when you couple the wall with sensors and drones and all of these other things, that works, as a combination. But if you don’t have a wall, they’re all just wasting their time. It’s just politics.

Thank you all very much."

There isn’t video of the alleged incident, where two white individuals allegedly assaulted the gay, black “Empire” actor, putting a rope around his neck and telling him, “This is MAGA country.” Chicago Police are still looking for two persons of interest, neither of whom has been located.

As of Thursday afternoon, Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there were no scheduled briefings in the case, which is odd considering it’s one of the highest-profile hate crimes in recent history. Part of that, one could speculate, has to do with the problems in Smollett’s story — in particular, the actor’s refusal to turn over a key piece of evidence.

Several sources confirmed that Smollett and his manager have refused to turn over their phones or phone records to Chicago Police; both would be considered key pieces of evidence because the actor says he was on the phone with the manager, Brandon Z. Moore, when the attack occurred.

Moore has said he heard the homophobic slurs and MAGA-related epithets hurled at Smollett. However, neither one has provided the department with access to evidence proving that the call even happened.

However, detectives are unable to “independently verify” the call occurred because Smollett refused to turn over his phone. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

In a statement Thursday, Chicago Police confirmed they didn’t have the records and that Smollett and Moore were stonewalling them on that account.

“Both the victim and the manager made independent statements to detectives that they were on the phone with one another during the alleged attack,” the statement said, according to The Wrap.

“CPD has no reason to doubt these claims. Detectives however were not able to independently verify the statements as cell phone records were not provided to investigators when asked. Therefore we are not able to confirm this.”

And again, it’s not like this was an airtight story before. Controversy regarding Smollett’s version of the events began when news came out that he hadn’t mentioned the “MAGA country” part during his initial interview with police.

Guglielmi confirmed that while Smollett hadn’t provided that information at first, he relayed it “to detectives during their initial follow-up investigation. They were not made initially to responding officers but detectives completed a supplemental report with the updated information.”

CNN also reported that a letter containing a white, powdery substance was sent to the “Empire” set in Chicago a week before the alleged Jan. 29 attack; the substance was determined to be aspirin, although the HAZMAT unit was called out to the scene.

According to TMZ, the letter was directed to Smollett, reading “You will die, black f—.” It also included “MAGA” as the return address. In the aftermath of the incident, however, Smollett declined extra security.

What can glean about the case from what we know? Smollett was threatened via a hoax anthrax letter just seven days before he claims to have been assaulted, a letter which brought out the HAZMAT team. In wake of this, not only did he refuse additional security, he decided to go out to get a sandwich at 2 a.m. and talk on the phone with his manager — at which point, he says, he was attacked.

Smollett claims he was assaulted in one of the most heavily surveilled parts of Chicago, yet no camera seems to have caught the incident as it happened. During his first interview with cops, he declined or forgot to give the Chicago Police a key piece of evidence — namely, the part about “MAGA country.” The fact that Smollett neglected to mention that his attackers were self-identified Trump supporters seems odd, given that it would have tied the assault back to the threatening letter he received just seven days prior.

Now, both he and his manager refuse to turn over their phones or records that would prove they were on the phone with each other, another key piece of evidence given Smollett’s statement to police.

Yet, it seems as if half of the Democrat field for 2020, however, have cosigned this putrefying story as if it were fact, as has every liberal for whom the phrase “MAGA country” is irresistible bait to them. The lesson from Covington Catholic, one can extrapolate from this, remains unlearned: If an incident backs up your preconceived notions about an issue almost too conveniently — as if the cultural issues it presented were custom-designed for your personal use — it may help to wait to see just how true it is.

As for Smollett, the fact that he refuses to turn over his phone or the records to Chicago Police isn’t exactly a wonderful portent for the veracity of his claims. There’s nothing in Smollett’s phone records that should justify not turning them over to police, particularly when they would prove his story; the refusal is basically blowing a hole in everything he’s said.

And, as for those who view Smollett’s claims uncritically, if you can still believe this narrative without reservations, I admire your effort but question your motives.

""I'm really fired up tonight,"" Page told host Stephen Colbert toward the end of their impassioned interview. ""It feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and the Vice President, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the government of Indiana. And I think the thing we need to know -- and I hope my show Gaycation did this in terms of connecting the dots what happened the other day to Jussie. I don't know him personally, I send him all of my love.""

Page continued with rising emotion, ""Connect the dots, this is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you wanna cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f--king stop.""

On Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two unidentified assailants who reportedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs at the actor, poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around Smollett's neck. Smollett later told police that the two men allegedly shouted ""This is MAGA Country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Numerous celebrities and activists have spoken out in support of Smollett. The actor himself also released a statement on Friday, the first public comments he made since being hospitalized. ""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,"" Smollett said, in part, to Essence. ""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

As governor of Indiana, Pence supported anti-gay legislation -- including, as reported by TIME, voting against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which ""would have banned discrimination against people based on sexual orientation."" Pence has also spoken out against gay marriage.

Page stars in The Umbrella Academy which debuts Friday, Feb. 8 on Netflix.

Smollett, who is black and came out as gay in 2015, was attacked by two men in Chicago on Tuesday, police said.

In a statement to US magazine Essence, Smollett said he “needed a moment to process” the “trauma, grief and pain”.

However, he warned that his attack should not be seen as an isolated incident and that similar incidents happened often.

Smollett also claimed that “certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations” had been spread since his release from hospital.

He said: “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.

“Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.

“I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.”

The attackers poured an “unknown chemical substance” over Smollett and wrapped a rope around his neck, according to investigators.

They shouted racial and homophobic slurs throughout the attack, police said. No arrests have been made.

Closing his statement, he said: “We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.

“Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Smollett has starred in Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terence Howard.

His Empire co-star Taraji P Henson is among the celebrities to have offered their support on social media.

As well as his acting, Smollett is also a singer and activist who has advocated HIV/Aids prevention.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett says he's doing ""ok"" after being attacked in Chicago.

It's the first time the 36-year-old has spoken about what happened.

Police are searching for two people who punched him, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" over him and put a rope around his neck.

In a statement, he has thanked fans for their support and says that love ""can't be kicked out of me"".

""Let me start by saying that I'm ok,"" he says.

""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

Jussie has told police his attackers also made reference to ""Maga"" (Make America Great Again).

The slogan was used by Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential campaign.

Police are investigating whether the actor was the victim of a hate crime.

While Jussie's had a huge amount of support, others have questioned his version of what happened.

The actress Ellen Page spoke about the case on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert - criticising some of the media for questioning whether it should be treated as a hate crime.

""It's absurd. This isn't a debate,"" she says.

Trending News: Jussie Smollett Says He’s ‘OK’ After Brutal Attack

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett is “OK” and wants to thank all the “beautiful people” for the love and support they gave him following a vicious attack that put him in hospital, he said in an exclusive statement to Essence.

“My body is strong but my soul is stronger,” he shared. “More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. ”

The actor, who plays a gay character on the Fox drama and is gay in real life, was beaten and left on the ground with a noose hanging from his neck in Chicago on January 29, according to a police report. He was also reportedly covered in an “unknown chemical substance” believed to be bleach.

Chicago police also told TMZ the attackers yelled ""MAGA country"" when they walked away.

Speaking for the first time since the incident on February 1, Smollett said some of the claims circulated online were false.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” he insisted. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,” Smollett said in the statement. “I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.”

Smollett didn’t provide any more details about Tuesday’s incident but said he will tell all eventually.

“We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he concluded. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief, and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Smollett’s family said in an Instagram statement posted to his sister Jurnee Smollett-Bell’s account on January 31 that they will pursue justice against the attackers.

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

The statement continued: “Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

The Smollett family statement concluded: “Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

The attack drew attention from a range of celebrities including John Legend, Zendaya, and Vivica A. Fox, and had rights organizations such as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) as well as The Anti-Violence Project (AVP) pointing out this kind of attack isn’t uncommon.

“Sending love to Jussie and the Smollett family after this horrific attack,” Legend tweeted. “We support you and pray that you find peace and justice.”

“Jussie is not alone,” wrote LGBTQ+ advocacy organization AVP in a Twitter thread. “Gay Black men are some of the most vulnerable to experiencing violence in the LGBTQ community and this must continue to be addressed, disrupted and challenged on all fronts.”

Police have released images of two potential suspects, but have not yet made any identifications. Law enforcement have also said the FBI is investigating a threat directed at the 36-year-old actor that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” films.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed assertions levelled on social media that he has been less than co-operative and changed his story.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100 per cent factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement.

""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven't found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the ""outpouring of love and support"" he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it ""horrible."" But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn't co-operated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett's refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he was on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven't found video of the attack, Smollett has been ""very co-operative and we have no reason at this point to think he's not being genuine with us.""

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn't be unusual that such an attack wouldn't be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn't provide full coverage, police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don't continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Johnson said of Smollett Friday

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reportedly declined to provide police with his cellphone after he was allegedly the target of a homophobic, racist attack.

Smollett was reportedly exiting a Chicago Subway restaurant at around 2 a.m. Tuesday when one of two men in ski masks asked him, “Aren’t you that f****t ‘Empire’ n****r?” before they both attacked the openly gay, black actor. Reports indicated that the men also tied a noose around his neck and dumped a liquid, possibly bleach, on him before fleeing the scene.

Since then sources reportedly told TMZ that police “informally asked” Smollett to provide his phone so they could confirm he was talking with his manager at the time of the incident, as reports indicated. Smollett allegedly said he felt “uncomfortable” with the request and declined — though he is believed to be providing police with his phone records.

According to NBC News, Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said Smollett has “been very cooperative” with their ongoing investigation and that they won’t require him to turn over his phone.”He’s a victim. We don’t treat him like a criminal,” Johnson told NBC News.

A police official had told TMZ that Smollett refused to turn over his phone and phone records, but other, unidentified sources told the news outlet that the actor did in fact agree to provide them with phone records, and is in the process of doing so.

Chicago police provided low-resolution images of two persons of interest that they’d like to speak with. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, police said these individuals were walking on New Street near Illinois Street between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m, around the time and about a block away from where Smollett claimed he was attacked.

While authorities haven’t recovered any footage showing Tuesday’s attack, Johnson said this isn’t uncommon despite cameras being located all over the city.

He told WLS, “I will say this: The crime that he reported is horrendous. It’s horrible. It was cowardly. We’ll do everything we can.”

CHICAGO — ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett is disputing rumors circulating on social media that he has been less than cooperative with the investigation into a racially-charged attack in which he says two masked men beat him and wrapped a rope around his neck in downtown Chicago.

In his first public statement since the attack early Tuesday, the black and gay actor said in a news release that he has been completely honest and ""consistent on every level"" with the police. He also said he is grateful for the outpouring of support he's received.

Police are searching for surveillance footage of the attack, but they say video does show Smollett returning home with a rope around his neck just after he says he was beaten.

Several LGBTQ and black activist groups are planning to hold a rally in New York City on Friday evening for Smollett and other LGBTQ survivors of violent crime."

""I'm really fired up tonight,"" Page told host Stephen Colbert toward the end of their impassioned interview. ""It feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and the Vice President, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the government of Indiana. And I think the thing we need to know -- and I hope my show Gaycation did this in terms of connecting the dots what happened the other day to Jussie. I don't know him personally, I send him all of my love.""

Page continued with rising emotion, ""Connect the dots, this is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you wanna cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f--king stop.""

On Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two unidentified assailants who reportedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs at the actor, poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around Smollett's neck. Smollett later told police that the two men allegedly shouted ""This is MAGA Country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Numerous celebrities and activists have spoken out in support of Smollett. The actor himself also released a statement on Friday, the first public comments he made since being hospitalized. ""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,"" Smollett said, in part, to Essence. ""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

As governor of Indiana, Pence supported anti-gay legislation -- including, as reported by TIME, voting against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which ""would have banned discrimination against people based on sexual orientation."" Pence has also spoken out against gay marriage.

Page stars in The Umbrella Academy which debuts Friday, Feb. 8 on Netflix.

The actor gave his first public statement about the attack to Essence, assuring his fans and the public at large that he is recovering from the incident. “Let me start by saying that I’m ok,” Smollett said. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger.”

Smollett shared his gratitude for the many people who shared their support for him and spoke out on his behalf, saying that the support has been extremely helpful for him. “More importantly I want to say thank you,” he said. “The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

According to police, Smollett claims he was approached by two individuals early Tuesday morning after he left a Subway restaurant in Chicago. He said his attackers yelled slurs at him, poured a yet-identified liquid on him, tied a noose around his neck and beat him before running away. The actor admitted himself to Northwestern Hospital and contacted authorities.

Recent statements from the police said that the investigating officers had asked Smollett to turn over his phone after the actor said he was on the phone with his manager at the time. According to the statement, Smollett refused, leading some online to question the actor’s claims about the assault.

Smollett, however, said in his statement that despite what conclusions some are jumping to, he is working with the police to find his attackers. “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

The actor’s statement comes one day after his family released a joint statement of support for Smollett, saying that the attack was a hate crime. “These targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” they wrote. “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

Smollett ended his statement saying that we would have more to say after taking the necessary time to process his emotions. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love,” he said. “It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”"

While promoting her upcoming Netflix series The Umbrella Academy on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, actress Ellen Page took on Vice President Mike Pence.

Page, who came out as gay in 2014, married dancer and choreographer Emma Portner back in January of 2018. So while she was especially fired up about climate change and its more immediate effects on the marginalized peoples of her native Canada, she was also angry about the racist, homophobic attack against Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

Ellen Page delivers a fiery speech on Colbert

“He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana,” she said of Pence. “I think the thing we need to know […] in terms of connecting the dots, in terms of what happened the other day to [Jussie Smollett]. Connect the dots. This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them… You go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen?”

As Colbert and The Late Show studio audience listened on in complete silence, Page continued.

“Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves,” she said. “People are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you can meet. I am lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this. This needs to f*cking stop.”

Page became very emotional by the end, but both her words and her pose were enough to stir a rousing cheer from the audience and many agreeable nods from Colbert. The moment also generated plenty of reactions on social media, where Page was commended for speaking out and Colbert was applauded for giving her the space to do so.

Like many across the country, Jon Barrett, 50, learned Tuesday that Jussie Smollett was beaten as he left a restaurant in Chicago in what police said was an apparently targeted attack being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Smollett, who plays an openly gay character on ‘Empire,’ told police one of the suspects yelled “Aren’t you that f****** ‘Empire’ n*****?” before the attack, during which they poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

“I thought it was awful and horrific and I went home that evening still thinking about it,” Barrett told InsideEdition.com.

He took to social media, and saw a friend suggested taking a proactive approach to rail against the attack.

“They wrote, ‘if you are disturbed or upset about this … send LGBT-related books to one of your old schools,’” Barrett, 50, said.

As luck would have it, the American Library Association’s Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table had just released the Rainbow Book List, its “annual bibliography of quality books with significant and authentic GLBTQ content, which are recommended for people from birth through 18 years of age.”

So Barrett reached out to the librarian at his junior high school in Idaho and offered to donate $100 worth of books from the Rainbow List to the school’s library.

“I'm a former, former, former … student (early 80s) who still has a vivid memory of being called ‘fag’ as I walked down the hall in 7th grade,” Barrett wrote in his email. “I never felt unsafe, but I always knew that the school library was a safe space.”

The incident wasn’t a reflection on the school, Barrett said, but he felt it important to include the recollection as an example of the pain he endured as a gay adolescent.

“What happened in Chicago [to Smollett] was totally different to people calling me a fag,” Barrett stressed. “Seventh, 8th grade, regardless of what you’re going through is awful. Mine just happened to be that I am gay, and everyone was realizing at the same time I was [and] declaring it before I was ready.”

He sent the email and set out to go about his day, not sure what sort of response he’d receive, or if he’d even get one at all. But before long, he received a heartfelt response that left him emotional.

Barrett said the librarian thanked him for his offer and said she would be honored to accept the donation.

“When I became a teacher and later a school librarian, probably my #1 priority was to make every bit of the school that I could influence, safe for all of my students,” she wrote in an email to Barrett that he shared with InsideEdition.com.

Noting the library has several books on the Rainbow List, she shared how happy she was to work in a school that “seems to openly and vocally embrace and support all of its students, no matter where they fall on the LGBTQIAP+ spectrum.

“Thank you so much for reaching out, and for finding something constructive to do with all of the awfulness we encounter in the world,” she continued in the email. “Fighting evil with love and generosity is, I think, what will make the difference in the end. I hope you have a really great day.”

InsideEdition.com has reached out to the librarian for comment.

Barrett shared his experience on Facebook, where friends noted they planned to reach out to their own alma maters.

The correspondence also inspired Barrett’s former schoolmate to inquire about sending the library books dealing with race and racism, which the librarian gratefully accepted.

“To know that there’s somebody in that space, thinking about kids like me … and clearly thinking about how to represent all of the kids … is pretty incredible,” Barrett said.

Barrett was heartened that his small gesture helped inspire others and urged others feeling the need to do something to start on a local level.

“I went to school in Chicago; I probably know the street he was on,” Barrett said. “I’ve lived in D.C., New York, LA, and I’ve never had that kind of fear, but what happened to [Smollett] makes it very real ... Doing something small, doing something with the energy, it helps.”

Earlier this week, Empire star Jussie Smollett found himself at the center of a horrific, violent situation, as the actor was attacked by two men who threw racist and homophobic remarks his way before putting a rope around his neck (an obvious reference to lynching) and pouring a chemical substance on him. He was hospitalized following the attack, but has since been released and is on the mend.

For the first time today, Smollett has released a statement — in part to update everyone regarding his condition, but also to dispel the notion that he has changed his story about the night of the attack. There have been some skewed accounts, either accidental or deliberate, online that have tried to misrepresent his story and his comments to police. This is Smollett trying to set the record straight and make it abundantly clear as to precisely what transpired with him.

Take a look at the full statement, via Essence, at the bottom of this article:

Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.

We remain horrified regarding precisely what happened to Smollett but are also grateful that he is taking the proper time to make sure that his mind and body are right after what happened. We know that there are understandably millions of people interested in hearing from him, but he has an understanding that what matters most at the moment is that he is okay.

Jussie could return to filming Empire next week; the series will return to Fox with new episodes this spring, and the show has already brought on additional security around its Chicago set following the incident. They’ve also brought on counseling to help those in need.

Empire star Jussie Smollett has now issued his first statement following a heinous hate crime attack in Chicago.

Jussie Smollett, the fast-rising actor on the hit series Empire, is now speaking out following an ugly hate crime attack in Chicago.

The alleged attack occurred early Tuesday morning, though Chicago Police have been unable to find any evidence of a crime. Smollett says he was approached by two people at roughly 2 a.m. while walking back to his residence. The pair screamed racial epithets, including the n-word, while slashing Smollett’s face and splashing a chemical (suspected to be bleach) onto the actor.

Smollett also says the pair applied a rope fashioned into a noose around his neck, and tightened it. When police arrived 40 minutes later, the noose was still around the actor’s neck, but loosened.

Smollett is openly-gay and African-American, and a strong supporter of LGBTQ causes.

As of this morning, Chicago Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmo reported that footage and images from more than 20 nearby cameras have been extensively searched, with no substantive evidence or clues produced. Guglielmo noted that a dozen investigators have been assigned to the case, with nothing more than a grainy image of two individuals walking down a nearby street discovered.

While the investigation continues, Smollett has refused to hand over his cellphone, for reasons that are unknown. Similarly, Smollett’s manager, who was on the phone with Smollett when the attack occurred, is also refusing to share his device with investigators.

The attack would have occurred at extremely low temperatures. During the early morning of Tuesday, temperatures easily dipped below 0°, with climes of —5° and even —11° reported. Those temperatures would have easily frozen a substance like bleach, though it’s still unclear what caustic liquid was employed in the attack.

Chicago Police have not disclosed if any evidence was collected at the attack point, including articles of clothing, weapons, or traces of the chemical.

Now, Smollett has formally issued a statement on the attack.

In a statement issued this morning to Essence, Smollett addresses the criticism he’s received after the incident, while also noting that he’s been completely factual and cooperative with investigators.

Here’s his statement."

""Let me start by saying that I'm OK,"" he said in a statement to Essence. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger.""

The Empire actor's statement comes a day after his family condemned the reported attack as a ""racial and homophobic hate crime"".

Smollett added that he is thankful for the support he has received in recent days.

""The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words,"" he told the magazine.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" the actor continued.

Chicago police are investigating the alleged assault against Smollett, who is black and openly gay, as a possible hate crime.

According to police, Smollett was attacked around 2am on Tuesday by ""two unknown offenders"" who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown ""chemical substance"" on Smollett and wrapped a rope around his neck.

Surveillance footage released by police on Wednesday shows two ""people of interest"" that investigators are now asking the public for help in identifying.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday that the video footage ""does not capture an encounter.""

Smollett told police that the attackers were male and dressed in black. One attacker was described as 5-feet-10 to 6-feet-1 and around 170 pounds (177cm to 182cm and 77kg), wearing a black mask to conceal his facial features.

Police have not specified the race of the alleged attackers.

Police say that Smollett is cooperating with their investigation.

""He's a victim right now, and we'll treat him like a victim,"" Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson told Chicago's ABC 7 in an interview Friday. ""He's been very cooperative and we have no reason, at this point, to think that he's not being genuine with us.""

Smollett told detectives his attackers said ""something to the effect of 'This is MAGA country',"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan, during the assault.

Guglielmi said the initial police report did not reference those comments, but the actor recalled the information in a follow-up interview with detectives.

On Thursday, Trump referred to reports of the attack as ""horrible"".

""It doesn't get worse,"" he said, in response to a White House reporter's question.

The reported assault has drawn widespread attention and condemnation. Democratic representative Bobby Rush sent a letter to the FBI director, writing he was ""disturbed"" by the reports and was requesting a hate-crime investigation.

In their statement, the Smollett family drew attention to victims of hate crimes, which have increased in recent years according to FBI data.

""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,"" the family said, a theme Smollett reiterated in his own statement.

""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,"" Smollett added.

""Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

Smollett, 35, comes from a family of advocates and actors. As a child, he and his five siblings co-starred in the short-lived ABC sitcom On Our Own.

According to a 2016 New York Times profile, Smollett and his sister, actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell (Friday Night Lights, Underground), have been involved with causes such as HIV/Aids prevention, the push to end apartheid and the Black Lives Matter movement.

Smollett, whose role on Empire as Jamal Lyon is one of the few black, openly gay characters on network TV, has also done work with LGBTQ advocacy organisations including GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign. Both organisations released statements in support of the actor following reports of his assault.

Smollett's parents, Janet and Joel Sr, met in the San Francisco Bay area as they worked on civil rights causes. They associated with founders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Black Panther party, according to the Times. (Joel Sr. died in 2015.)

In the statement, the family said they ""will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world."""

He shows up at all the community events; he does a lot working with the community, but he comes from that kind of family. And so, I’m pleased that he’s doing okay.”

She continued, “But we have to understand this is happening for a reason. Why all of a sudden do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have a picnic while black, and being attacked? It’s coming from the President of the United States. He’s dog-whistling every day. He’s separating and dividing, and he is basically emboldening those folks who feel this way, maybe never said and never talked about it, never could act it out, but now they’re on it.”

She added, “When I heard about what had happened to Jussie, and I heard they put a rope around him, and they poured bleach on him and stuff, I was absolutely, very upset. So I’m feeling better that he’s OK, and I am looking forward to seeing him.”

In an emotional breakdown on Thursday’s Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Page claimed Pence did not want her to be married to her lesbian spouse and blamed the Trump administration of stoking hate against the LGBTQ community.

“I’m like really fired up right now, but it feels impossible not to feel this way right now with the president and the vice president, Mike Pence, who wishes I could not be married, let’s just be clear,” Page said.

“The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife,” she continued. “He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.”

“Connect the dots, this is what happens,” Page said, discussing Smollett who she admits she did not know on a personal level. “If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering — what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street.”

Page cited her new show Gaycation for giving her a wider perspective on gay issues.

“I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet,” she said. “I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f—ing stop.”

Smollett was allegedly attacked by two people earlier this week in Chicago in what police are investigating as a “hate crime.” The attackers, who reportedly had their faces covered, beat Smollett as they called him racist and gay slurs, threw a chemical substance on him, and put a rope around his neck.

Some reports claim the suspects yelled, “MAGA country!” during the attack, however those reports have not been substantiated.

Police are still combing through surveillance video of the area, but have yet to locate footage showing the attack. Chicago PD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi claimed Smollett refused to turn his phone over to detectives.

President Trump on Thursday addressed the attack, saying, “That I can tell you is horrible.”

“It doesn’t get worse,” he added.

The 35-year-old actor and singer told fans at a concert at West Hollywood’s Troubadour club on Saturday (February 2) that he wasn’t hospitalised following the January 29 assault, as previously reported.

CNN reports that he told the crowd that he was left with bruises but went to see a doctor immediately instead of going to hospital. He also clarified that his ribs were neither cracked nor broken, as had also been previously reported.

Additionally, he revealed that he defended himself during the attack. “I had to be here tonight, y’all, I couldn’t let those [expletives]… win,” he said. “Above all I fought … [expletive] back.”

He said that he isn’t “fully healed yet,” before adding, “But I’m going to (be), and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The incident has been described by the Chicago Police Department as a “possible racially-charged assault and battery.”

Speaking to Essence last week, Smollett said: “Let me start by saying that I am okay…my body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to put into words.”

Yesterday, Smollett’s family also issued a statement about the incident in which they thanked people for their support whilst also speaking out about the incident in more detail.

The statement read: “Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time.

“Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable.”

The statement concluded: “Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

Adding to his own statement, Smollett went on to echo the words of his family, saying that such incidents are not rare. He said: “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.

“We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process…Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

On the day of the attack The Chicago Police Department released further information about the “hate crime” incident. They wrote: “A 36-year-old man was walking…when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him.

“The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.

“The victim self-transported to Northwestern Hospital and is [in] good condition. Area central detectives are investigating.”

Smollett was in Chicago ahead of a concert that he was due to perform. The night before, the actor and singer posted in Instagram, saying that he had arrived in the city “after spending 7 hours on a plane for a 2 hour flight.”

LGBTQ campaigners GLADD released a statement following the incident, offering help. They said: “GLADD reached out to Fox and Jussie’s team today to offer assistance as well as support for him. Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

The Chicago Police Department have asked that anyone with information about the incident should contact 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com."

Actor and singer Jussie Smollett, who alleges he was the victim of a brutal racial and homophobic attack, is a former child star who grew up to become a champion of LGBT rights and one of the few actors to play a black gay character on primetime TV. His breakthrough came aboard the hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" playing Jamal Lyon, a talented R&B singer struggling to earn his father's approval and find his place in his dad's music empire. It became one of the biggest network shows to star a gay black character. Associated Press/May 20, 2016

Jussie Smollett spoke publicly for the first time since he was attacked Tuesday in Chicago. ""Let me start by saying that I'm OK,"" he said in a statement to Essence. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger.""

The ""Empire"" actor's statement comes a day after his family condemned the reported attack as a ""racial and homophobic hate crime."" Smollett added that he's thankful for the support he has received in recent days. ""The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words,"" he told the magazine.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" the actor continued.

Chicago police are investigating the alleged assault against Smollett, who is black and openly gay, as a possible hate crime. According to police, Smollett was attacked around 2 a.m. Tuesday by ""two unknown offenders"" who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown ""chemical substance"" on Smollett and wrapped a rope around his neck.

Surveillance footage released by police Wednesday shows two ""people of interest"" that investigators are now asking the public for help in identifying. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Wednesday that the video footage ""does not capture an encounter.""

Smollett told police that the attackers were male and dressed in black. One attacker was described as 5-feet-10 to 6-feet-1 and around 170 pounds, wearing a black mask to conceal his facial features. Police have not specified the race of the alleged attackers.

Police say that Smollett is cooperating with their investigation. ""He's a victim right now, and we'll treat him like a victim,"" Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson told Chicago's ABC 7 in an interview Friday. ""He's been very cooperative and we have no reason, at this point, to think that he's not being genuine with us.""

Smollett told detectives his attackers said ""something to the effect of 'This is MAGA country,'"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan, during the assault. Guglielmi said the initial police report did not reference those comments, but the actor recalled the information in a follow-up interview with detectives.

On Thursday, Trump referred to reports of the attack as ""horrible."" ""It doesn't get worse,"" he said, in response to a White House reporter's question.

The reported assault has drawn widespread attention and condemnation. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., sent a letter to the FBI director, writing he was ""disturbed"" by the reports and was requesting a hate-crime investigation.

In their statement, the Smollett family drew attention to victims of hate crimes, which have increased in recent years according to FBI data. ""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,"" the family said, a theme Smollett reiterated in his own statement.

""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,"" Smollett added. ""Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

Smollett, 35, comes from a family of advocates and actors. As a child, he and his five siblings co-starred in the short-lived ABC sitcom ""On Our Own."" According to a 2016 New York Times profile, Smollett and his sister, actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell (""Friday Night Lights,"" ""Underground""), have been involved with causes such as HIV/AIDS prevention, the push to end apartheid and the Black Lives Matter movement.

Smollett, whose role on ""Empire"" as Jamal Lyon is one of the few black, openly gay characters on network TV, has also done work with LGBTQ advocacy organizations including GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign. Both organizations released statements in support of the actor following reports of his assault.

Smollett's parents, Janet and Joel Sr., met in the San Francisco Bay area as they worked on civil rights causes. They associated with founders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Black Panther party, according to the Times. (Joel Sr. died in 2015.)

In the statement, the family said they ""will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world."""

Smollett also talked about the ongoing police investigation.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” he said. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

The attack took place Tuesday morning in Chicago, where two unknown suspects yelled racial and homophobic slurs at Smollett, poured a chemical substance on him, wrapped a rope around his neck and, according to Smollett, yelled, “this is MAGA country.” They then fled the scene and the singer was taken to Northwestern Hospital, where he was later discharged.

Chicago PD has confirmed that Smollett did receive a letter sent to the studio where Empire is filmed on January 22, prior to the attack, that contained a white powder that turned out to be aspirin. The letter prompted a HAZMAT unit response. Though Chicago PD did not disclose what the letter said, music blog That Grape Juice, which first broke news of the attack, previously reported that the letter said “Die Black fag.”

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has spoken out after he was the victim of a reported racist and homophobic attack in Chicago.

Out TV star Smollett, who plays a high-profile gay character on Fox show Empire was attacked in the early hours of Tuesday (January 29) in Chicago.

The actor was hospitalised after the violent incident, in which he was reportedly branded a “faggot Empire n****r” and had a noose tied around his neck by two men.

Police have released CCTV stills of two people they are seeking to speak to in connection with the attack, with the FBI also assisting in the investigation.

Jussie Smollett: I will address all details of this horrific incident

Smollett spoke out about the incident for the first time on Friday (February 1) in a statement to Essence.

Smollett also addressed “frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread,” a possible reference to alt-right conspiracy theories and misinformation surrounding the attack.

He added: “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.

“These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers, and non-gender conforming siblings daily.

Jussie Smollett’s family branded attack ‘domestic terrorism’

Smollett’s comments come after a separate statement from his family, which branded the incident “domestic terrorism.”

The statement issued on Thursday (January 31) by the Smollett family said: “Our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack.

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

The family continued: “We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country.

“Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable.”"

The “Empire” star was the victim of a brutal attack in Chicago earlier this week. Two men allegedly assaulted him while yelling racial and homophobic slurs as he was leaving a Subway restaurant. They doused him with an unknown chemical substance and tied a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene. Smollett reportedly fractured a rib and checked himself into the hospital.

In a statement to Essence on Friday (Feb. 1), Smollett says he is “OK” and is working with police.

On Wednesday (Jan. 30), investigators released images from surveillance video that shows two “potential persons of interest” allegedly involved in the attack.

Smollett’s family has also spoken out following the homophobic and racist attack. “Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed,” the family’s statement read. “We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country.”

Numerous celebrities have written Smollett messages of support, including his co-star Taraji P. Henson, who vowed on Instagram, ""Hate will not win.""

MARIANNA MASSEY/GETTY Jussie Smollett says he was the victim of a hate crime.

Smollett also expressed concern with how his case is being reported in the media, noting, ""I am working with authorities and have been 100 per cent factual and consistent on every level."" However, he said, ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

He also reiterated a point made by his family in their statement, issued Thursday: ""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.""

In closing, Smollett promised fans, ""We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

In their remarks, Smollett's family also stressed that attack like his will continue to happen ""until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions"".

While updating the media on the case Thursday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that detectives had recovered surveillance-camera footage of Smollett arriving home at his apartment with a rope around his neck. He said the video was recorded minutes after the actor said he was attacked.

However, he noted that investigators still have still have not managed to locate footage of the assault itself, which took place in Chicago's Streeterville neighbourhood around 2am (local time) Tuesday. Meanwhile, police have released several images of ""potential persons of interest"" whom they seek to question.

In addition to placing a rope around his neck, Smollett said his attackers poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him, and used racial and homophobic slurs. (Smollett, who is black and gay, later told police his assailants yelled, ""This is MAGA country!"" during the incident.)

The Empire actor, 35, says he's working with authorities on a case that Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime.

""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you.

""The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

Smollett's attackers allegedly hit the actor, placed a rope around his neck, poured an unidentified substance on him and yelled homophobic and racial slurs at him, Chicago police said.

Police have not seen video of the confrontation but say they viewed security footage showing Smollett with a rope draped around his neck.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100 per cent factual and consistent on every level,"" Smollett said in his statement.

""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Officials released an image on Wednesday showing two persons of interest in the case.

Police have not identified any suspects, and no arrests have been made.

The new remarks from Smollett, who came out as gay in 2015, follow his family's statement one day earlier calling the attack a ""racial and homophobic hate crime"".

Smollett said in his statement, ""As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.

""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.""

He said he will further address the situation after taking a moment to process it."

According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, Smollett was beaten by two men who approached him by yelling out ""racial and homophobic slurs"" at approximately 2 a.m. on Tuesday morning in the 300 block of E. North Water St. They proceeded to assault Smollett and ""poured an unknown chemical substance"" on him.

The two men are also said to have put a rope around Smollett's neck before fleeing on foot. Smollett then transported himself to an area hospital.

In an interview with Variety, Smollett's music manager, who was on the phone with Smollett at the time the attack occurred, confirmed earlier reports that the two assailants had shouted, ""This is MAGA country"" at Smollett during the assault.

""I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,"" he said.

The Chicago PD has since released photographs of two persons of interest in the case and are asking the public for their help in identifying them."

SHOW TRANSCRIPT

Chicago police are still investigating the alleged assault on ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett, and new details have given us a better picture of the timeline.

Police disclosed to CNN Thursday that an envelope with a letter and white powder was sent to the Chicago set of the hit Fox drama on Jan. 22, prompting a hazmat response. Police declined to reveal the contents of the letter but said the powder turned out to be aspirin.

Exactly a week later, Smollett, a black and openly gay actor, said he was attacked by two men. They allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs and poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him while beating him.

At some point, one of the attackers reportedly tied a thin rope around the actor's neck. According to The New York Times, Smollett later told police the suspects yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" as they attacked him.

MAGA refers to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Smollett, who was on the phone with his manager as the attack happened, then retreated to a nearby hotel where his manager was staying.

Police requested Smollett turn in his cellphone to verify the phone call, but Smollett declined and police aren't going to force him to. The police department superintendent told NBC Chicago: ""He's a victim. We don't treat him like a criminal.""

On Friday, Smollett spoke out about the attack to Essence, saying he is OK and pushing back against rumors that his story has been inconsistent. He also said that these types of attacks happen to his ""brothers, sisters, and gender non-conforming siblings daily"" and should not be seen as an isolated incident.

Police are poring over hours of surveillance footage and have found images of two suspects, as well as footage of Smollett entering the hotel with a rope around his neck. They have not found footage of the attack itself.

In a statement to US magazine Essence, Smollett said he ""needed a moment to process"" the ""trauma, grief and pain"" he suffered as a result of the unprovoked attack.

He warned that his attack should not be seen as isolated and that similar incidents often occurred, and also claimed that ""certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations"" had been spread since his release from hospital.

Earlier this week, but what seems like a lifetime ago, actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted by two white men around 2 a.m in Chicago on his way to get food. According to the police records, the two men beat him, poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. They referred to him as that “faggot” from Empire “nigger” before attacking him.

In an exclusive statement with Essence released today, Smollett said the following concerning his attack and the aftermath:

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.” “With Love, respect & honor…Jussie.”

Jussie Smollett’s statement summarizes all of the light that exists within him and what those evil bastards tried to snuff out. I am glad he is taking the time to heal and take care of himself so that he can use this moment to be a leader. That is not his responsibility, but it is clear that he wants to use this moment to shed a light on not just his assault, but the murders and assaults that many queer people of color, especially Black trans women and non-binary people, face in this country.

While the authorities are still investigating the incident, I just want to say to all those people who would rather believe that Smollett made up what happened than accept that there is endemic racism and homophobia in this country, please go fuck yourselves.

In my previous piece, I put the catalyst for this on Trump’s doorstep, but that was a mistake. It belongs on the doorsteps of Trump and Mike Pence. Mike Pence with his faux-sangfroid nature that makes people think he is “presidential” or even more hilariously an “adult.” Anyone who believes this and supports Pence needs to bear part of the responsibility for being a part of the anti-LGBTQ aspects of this administration and attempting to normalize it through the shroud of religious freedom.

As Ellen Page said in her interview with Stephen Colbert last night:

“The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana. And I think the thing we need to know—and I hope my show Gaycation did this—is in terms of connecting the dots, in terms of what happened the other day to Jussie. I don’t know him personally. I send all of my love. Connect the dots. This is what happens. If you are in a position of power, and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble. You spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused. And they’re going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street.”

They may not have originated the atmosphere of hate we live in, but they have been key to normalizing it and perpetuating this “both sides” mentality that has been adopted by the media to seem fair, instead of calling these actions hateful when they clearly are.

We know what happened to Jussie Smollett because he is a star, he is a public person, and because of that, he may have more accessibility to justice than most. But we would be failing Smollett and other people if we act as though what happened to him is a one-off. To have justice for Jussie Smollett means getting justice for Black and queer people everywhere—and to fight back against the mentality that tells us that calling out the reality of what it is to be Black and openly gay in spaces is being too sensitive.

The Empire star, who has sadly been in the news all week after he was savagely beaten early Tuesday morning in Chicago, has released his first statement since this awful incident.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,"" Smollett told Essence magazine on Friday, adding:

""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

Smollett wasn't simply punched or kicked this week.

The two assailants also tied a rope around his neck and poured bleach all over him.

They screamed homophobic taunts and racial epithets in his direction, while reportedly screaming that Smollett is in ""MAGA country.""

Police have since released two photos of the alleged suspects.

Continued Smollett in his statement:

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level.

""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Smollett is referring to a couple things here.

First, it was unclear initially whether the attackers made the aforementioned ""MAGA comment.""

But reports have since indicated that Smollett did tell authorities as much.

Second, there was talk that Smollett refused to turn over his cell phone records -- but it's since been reported that he simply didn't want to turn over his actual cell phone to the cops on the spot.

""As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,"" concluded Smollett.

""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.

""Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.

""With Love, respect & honor … Jussie.”

On Thursday evening, Smollett's loved ones released a statement of their own.

It reads, in part:

We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice...

Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.

We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country...

Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.

Many people have interpreted this final section as a shot against President Donald Trump.

The President has since commented on this awful situation, however.

Click the video above to see what he said.

And join us in sending the very best wishes to Jussie Smollett.

We're thinking of you, man."

Page said, “We have a media that’s saying it’s a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd. It isn’t a debate.”

Colbert interjected, “I agree.”

Page continued, “Sorry, I’m like, I’m really fired up tonight.”

Colbert encouraged, “You have to be fired up.”

Page then went on her rant:

It feels impossible to not feel this way now with the president and Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married. Let’s be clear. The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana, and I think the thing we need to know and I hope my show Gaycation did this in terms of connecting the dots in terms of what happened the other day to Jussie, I don’t know him personally, I send all of my love. Connect the dots. This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?

Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f***ing stop.

As Mediate reports, “The attack on Smollett, which he reported as being attacked by two men in masks, beaten, had a rope tied around his neck, and doused with bleach at 2:00 A.M. in Chicago, is still under investigation by police. The Chicago police so far only have video footage of two people who were walking nearby at the time of the incident. No video of the attack has been found so far, according to the Chicago Tribune.”

Earlier in the interview, Page criticized Hollywood for not being progressive enough, saying, “There’s clear evidence that it has changed, that there is some progress, that there is some more representation, but honestly, I really think we need to hurry up. It’s not cutting it. Hollywood, and the film industry in particular, in particular is just so binary, and it is so, I find, can be so narrow in its ideas of who can tell stories and who can be in the stories, and I hope it continues to change. And like I say, clearly there are changes, and there’s extraordinary people that are leading the way in doing that, But I hope it continues to go quicker because there’s certain things I’m sick and tired of, yeah.”

The ""Empire"" actor, whose statement was first published by Essence on Friday, said he was attacked in the early morning hours on Tuesday in what Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime.

""Let me start by saying that I'm OK,"" the actor said. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger.""

He went on to share his gratitude.

Smollett said he was attacked by two people who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,"" according to police.

Smollett plays a gay character on ""Empire"" and also identifies as gay.

He also reported that one of his attackers put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, police said.

Investigators said they have video of Smollett entering the hotel after the alleged attack with what appears to be a noose around his neck.

On Thursday, the Smollett family issued their first official statement since the incident.

They condemned the ""violent and unprovoked attack,"" calling it ""a racial and homophobic hate crime.""

""Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love,"" he said. ""It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

CNN's Don Lemon spoke to Smollett and a mutual friend who was at the hospital with the actor on Tuesday.

Smollett said he was shaken and angry that an attack like this could happen.

He also told CNN he fought back against the attackers.

Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Actor Jussie Smollett broke his silence Friday about an attack in Chicago this week, saying he is ""OK,"" as police look for more clues in the case.

Smollett told Essence magazine, ""Let me start by saying that I'm OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Police said the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender activist and star of the television program Empire was beaten by two men Tuesday as he walked from a Chicago restaurant to his apartment. He said the men put a noose around his neck.

Smollett told police the attackers used homophobic and racist slurs before beating him.

Police are investigating the case as a possible hate crime. Smollett and his family believe the attack occurred because of his race and sexual orientation.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said they're reviewing hundreds of hours of video footage from over 20 surveillance cameras in the area of the attack. No images have yet been found, although the cameras recorded Smollett's walk through the neighborhood.

Guglielmi told NBC News Thursday the actor has declined to turn over his cellphone to investigators. Authorities are seeking to confirm Smollett spoke with his manager as the assault began. The manager told police he heard the attackers say, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Police have released some of the video footage and have identified two ""potential persons of interest,"" but did not identify them as suspects.

Smollett's family, in an Instagram post Thursday, said they want the assailants found.

""Our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack,"" it read. ""We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice."""

Yesterday, the family of Jussie Smollett spoke out after two men assaulted the Empire actor in a racist, homophobic attack . Calling him “a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed,” his parents and siblings used the opportunity to decry all hate-motivated attacks on marginalized communities as “inhumane acts of domestic terrorism.” Today, Smollett himself has emerged with a statement of his own.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett, who was reportedly found after the attack with a rope around his neck, said in a statement to Essence. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

He continued:



I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.

The Chicago Police Department is currently investigating Smollett’s attack as a hate crime. CPD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi has said that, by Smollett’s account, the actor was taunted with homophobic slurs and cries of “MAGA country.” Smollett also claims he was doused with an unknown chemical before one of the individuals wrapped the rope around his neck.

In his Friday statement, obtained by USA Today, Smollett, 36, wrote, ""Let me start by saying that I'm ok. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

Numerous celebrities have written Smollett messages of support, including his co-star Taraji P. Henson, who vowed on Instagram, ""Hate will not win.""

Smollett also expressed concern with how his case is being reported in the media, noting, ""I am working with authorities and have been 100 per cent factual and consistent on every level."" However, he said, ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

He also reiterated a point made by his family in their statement, issued Thursday: ""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.""

In closing, Smollett promised fans, ""We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident but I need a moment to process.

In their remarks, Smollett's family also stressed that attack like his will continue to happen ""until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions"".

While updating the media on the case Thursday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that detectives had recovered surveillance-camera footage of Smollett arriving home at his apartment with a rope around his neck. He said the video was recorded minutes after the actor said he was attacked.

However, he noted that investigators still have still have not managed to locate footage of the assault itself, which took place in Chicago's Streeterville neighbourhood around 2am (local time) Tuesday. Meanwhile, police have released several images of ""potential persons of interest"" whom they seek to question.

In addition to placing a rope around his neck, Smollett said his attackers poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him, and used racial and homophobic slurs. (Smollett, who is black and gay, later told police his assailants yelled, ""This is MAGA country!"" during the incident.)

Chicago PD and the FBI are working the case, which reportedly involved two ski-mask wearing men hitting him over the head, placing a noose around his neck, and pouring bleach on him while yelling homophobic and racial slurs. His statement arrives alongside more information about the threatening letter that was said to be received on the Empire set last week. The envelope containing the letter included a white powder that was determined to be aspirin by a HAZMAT unit, although law enforcement hasn’t divulged the message within the letter.

Smollett used his statement (which he released to Essence) to first thank his supporters while also assuring them that he’s recovering:

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

The actor and singer turned to an unavoidable subject, presumably involving the chatter that he and his manager are somehow not cooperating by turning over their cell phones and records (to tangibly prove that they were on the phone with each other during the attack). The Chicago PD has stated that they have “no reason to doubt” the independent statements made by both parties, only that they haven’t been able to independently confirm the time of the call via cell records. Smollett insists to Essence that he’s working with police:

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollet also addressed a statement from his family — who has called the attack “inhumane” and an act of “domestic terrorism” while describing Jussie as “a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed” — and explained that he would soon fully address details of the assault:"

Smollett, who is black and came out as gay in 2015, was attacked by two men in Chicago on Tuesday, police said.

In a statement to US magazine Essence, Smollett said he “needed a moment to process” the “trauma, grief and pain”.

However, he warned that his attack should not be seen as an isolated incident and that similar incidents happened often.

Smollett has starred in Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terence Howard.

His Empire co-star Taraji P Henson is among the celebrities to have offered their support on social media.

As well as his acting, Smollett is also a singer and activist who has advocated HIV/Aids prevention."

“Beautiful people. Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett said in a statement.

“My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Smollett disputed claims that he’s not being truthful with law enforcement officials investigating Tuesday’s incident in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett said in the statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said Friday that Smollett has been cooperative with detectives, and that the department is making progress in its investigation.

“We have no reason to think he’s not being genuine with us,” Johnson said. “The allegations that are described to us are horrendous, horrible and quite frankly cowardly. He is a victim, and we treat him like a victim.”

Johnson said the national attention on the case hasn’t caused a rush to wrap up the investigation.

“I don’t think we’re under anymore pressure to solve this one than we are any case,” Johnson said at a news conference.

Police have said Smollett described his attackers as two men wearing ski masks and all black clothing. In a follow-up interview, he told detectives that the men yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

With some 35,000 video surveillance cameras installed around the city, police are optimistic a “bread crumb” will lead them to the two people of interest.

Police this week released the first surveillance images of two people captured on camera about the time and in the area of the attack.

“It’s not very good quality at all, but it’s definitely a starting point for detectives that at least lets us know there were people in that area,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said of the photos.

The video from which the images were captured shows two people walking together and Smollett strolling alone in the opposite direction, Guglielmi said, adding there has so far been no video found of the reported attack.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, was walking back to his apartment about 2 a.m. after a stop at a Subway restaurant when two men walked up to him, yelled racist and homophobic slurs, poured what is suspected to be bleach on him and put a rope around his neck.

Investigators have also looked at footage of Smollett’s apartment the morning of the reported attack.

“He is seen on apartment security cameras and he does have a rope around his neck. That rope is fashioned in what has been described as a noose,” Guglielmi said.

The rope and Smollett’s clothing have been taken into evidence, Guglielmi said.

Smollett’s relatives in a statement Thursday called the attack an act of “domestic terrorism.”

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,” his relatives said.

In his statement, Smollett said the “cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.”

“I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident but I need a moment to process,” he added. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

The FBI is separately investigating a letter sent on Jan. 22 to Fox and “Empire” offices that used “threatening” language toward Smollett and was laced with some type of white, powdery substance, according to a police spokesman.

The case is being worked by more than a dozen police detectives, some with hate crime specializations . Anyone with information can call (312) 747-8382 or submit an anonymous tip at cpdtip.com.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven’t found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support” he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it “horrible.” But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn’t cooperated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett’s refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven’t found video of the attack, Smollett has been “very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.”

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn’t be unusual that such an attack wouldn’t be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn’t provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don’t continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

“Somewhere out there there’s a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,” he said, pointing out that the two aren’t considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence.

Now, Smollett has issued his first public statement since he was hospitalized following the attack, in an exclusive first published by Essence.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett wrote, per Essence. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. Most importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett went on. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

According to a police statement released by the Chicago Police Department on Tuesday, Smollett was walking in Chicago when two men “approached him and gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs”—per TMZ, one said “This is MAGA country,” referencing the Trump campaign slogan, which Smollett later confirmed according to The Washington Post. The two men beat him, “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him, and tied a noose about his neck before they fled; Smollett then brought himself to Northwestern Hospital.

Yesterday, Smollett’s family issued a statement, which his sister, actor Jurnee Smollett-Bell, posted to her Instagram: “We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers, and our gender-nonconforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions.” The statement appeared a sharp rebuke to dulled-down descriptions of the attack as “racially charged”—as opposed to, quite simply, racist—in coverage of the attack in the hours and days following the initial report.

The Empire actor echoed his family’s sentiments in his own statement, adding, “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers, and non–gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.” Smollett has been an outspoken advocate for queer and gender-nonconforming young people as a spokesperson for the Trevor Project, as well as for the Black Lives Matter movement.

“Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief, and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love,” Smollett said. “It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

The “Empire” actor, whose statement was first published by Essence on Friday, said he was attacked in the early morning hours on Tuesday in what Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime.

Smollett addressed his statement to the “beautiful people.”

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” the actor said. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger.”

He went on to share his gratitude.

“More importantly I want to say thank you,” Smollett said. “The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

The star also addressed speculation that he has been less than forthcoming with authorities and that his story has changed since he originally reported the incident.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett added. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett said he was attacked by two people who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,” according to police.

Smollett plays a gay character on “Empire” and also identifies as gay.

He also reported that one of his attackers put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, police said.

Investigators said they have video of Smollett entering the hotel after the alleged attack with what appears to be a noose around his neck.

On Thursday, the Smollett family issued their first official statement since the incident.

They condemned the “violent and unprovoked attack,” calling it “a racial and homophobic hate crime.”

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning,” the family’s statement read. “His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

“I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,” he said. “We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.”

Smollett concluded with a message of resilience.

“Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love,” he said. “It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

CNN’s Don Lemon spoke to Smollett and a mutual friend who was at the hospital with the actor on Tuesday.

Smollett said he was shaken and angry that an attack like this could happen.

He also told CNN he fought back against the attackers.

ABC/Lorenzo Bevilaqua(CHICAGO) — Jussie Smollett is speaking out for the first time since allegedly being attacked Tuesday in Chicago, in what police are investigating as a hate crime.

In a statement to ABC News, Smollett assured fans that he’s on the mend, and shared his gratitude.

“Let me start by saying that I’m O.K.,” Smollett began. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. ”

Smollett also addressed the rumors about the attack.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett said he shouldn’t be “looked upon as an isolated incident,” since LGBTQ people in general are also targeted.

“We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he said. “During times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love…And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Jussie’s statement comes a day after his family released a statement condemning the attack.

Friday, Chicago police told ABC’s WLS-TV they have “identified two potential persons of interest.” While they haven’t officially confirmed the attack, they say Smollett is being cooperative, and added, “We have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.”

Smollett says he was attacked by two men who hurled racial and homophobic epithets at him, threw an unknown substance on him and put a rope around his neck, while using the phrase “MAGA country.”

CHICAGO - ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett said Friday that he has been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation into what he says was a racist and homophobic attack on him in downtown Chicago earlier this week.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed assertions levelled on social media that he has been less than co-operative and changed his story.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven't found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the ""outpouring of love and support"" he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it ""horrible."" But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn't co-operated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett's refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven't found video of the attack, Smollett has been ""very co-operative and we have no reason at this point to think he's not being genuine with us.""

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn't be unusual that such an attack wouldn't be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn't provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don't continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

""Somewhere out there there's a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,"" he said, pointing out that the two aren't considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence."

Jussie Smollett has broken his silence after he was attacked in an apparent hate crime that left him hospitalized in Chicago.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words,” the Empire star, 36, said in a statement to Essence on Friday, February 1.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” he continued. “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.

Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me. With Love, respect & honor … Jussie.”

The statement comes three days after Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed to Us Weekly that the Mighty Ducks actor transported himself to a local hospital following the incident. Guglielmi explained that Smollett was approached by two people on Tuesday, January 29, who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him.”

Guglielmi continued: “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

Smollett — who came out as gay in a 2015 interview with Ellen DeGeneres — was released from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in “good condition” later that day, according to the spokesman.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Guglielmi added. “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators, and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com.”

Chicago police confirmed to Us Weekly on Wednesday, January 30, that police had found potential persons of interest in a surveillance video.

Following the attack, many celebrities spoke out in support of Smollett, including his Empire costars Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson.

“Jaws dropped to the ground,” Howard, who plays the actor’s father on the show, said during a Good Morning America interview on Tuesday morning. “And then when we learned there had been letters that had been sent to Fox as threats about the potential of something like this … then we became much more frightened.”

As for how Smollett is handling the situation, Howard, 49, explained: “You know, he’s angry, but I know Jussie … Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t — and we cannot — forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

Henson, for her part, took to Instagram the following day to share her thoughts. “I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now,” the 48-year-old What Men Want actress, who portrays Smollett’s mother on Empire, wrote. “@jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.”"

Billy Porter is having a hard time wrapping his head around the violence that was inflicted on Jussie Smollett on Tuesday, January 29, but one emotion is at the forefront — anger.

“I just feel rage,” the Kinky Boots alum, 49, told Us Weekly exclusively at the 34th annual Artios Awards in New York City on Thursday, January 31. “And until I can turn the rage into something that’s active, I’m trying to be respectful and not just vomit all over everybody … because that’s what I feel like doing.”

While Porter — who is openly gay — acknowledged that the Empire star, 36, has many people who “stand with him,” he isn’t sure “what the action is” to prevent similar crimes from happening again in the future.

“It’s very difficult. It’s very close, you know?” the American Horror Story actor continued. “I’m almost 50 years old and I’m a black man. I’ve been living with targets on my back my whole life.”

He added: “The fact that we can wake up and we still have to say, ‘We’re investigating a ‘possible’ hate crime’ when someone has been noosed and called ‘that f—got n—ga from Empire …’ We’re still investigating whether it’s a hate crime? It’s that kind of stuff that I have lost my grace when it comes to talking about. So, I’m trying to figure it out.”

As for Smollett’s future? Porter has no doubt that the Marshall star will come out on top. The Tony winner noted: “I’ve reached out to Jussie; he’s fine. He’s a strong man. We’ll figure out what to do with it. We’ll figure out where to go from this.” He added, however, that “everyone has to wake up” because “we’re in a civil war for our lives.”

Smollett was attacked in Chicago on Tuesday, January 29. Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed to Us that the singer-songwriter was attacked by two people who were yelling “racial and homophobic slurs toward him.”

“The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.” Guglielmi added. “At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.” Smollett was hospitalized and later released “in good condition.”

The following day, “potential persons of interest” were identified by the Chicago Police Department, but no arrests have been made at this time.

The Smollett family released an emotional statement regarding the “racial and homophobic hate crime” on Thursday. They wrote: “We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

""I'm really fired up tonight,"" Page told host Stephen Colbert toward the end of their impassioned interview. ""It feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and the Vice President, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the government of Indiana. And I think the thing we need to know — and I hope my show Gaycation did this in terms of connecting the dots what happened the other day to Jussie. I don't know him personally, I send him all of my love.""

Page continued with rising emotion, ""Connect the dots, this is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you wanna cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f--king stop.""

On Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two unidentified assailants who reportedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs at the actor, poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around Smollett's neck. Smollett later told police that the two men allegedly shouted ""This is MAGA Country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Numerous celebrities and activists have spoken out in support of Smollett. The actor himself also released a statement on Friday, the first public comments he made since being hospitalized. ""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,"" Smollett said, in part, to Essence. ""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

As governor of Indiana, Pence supported anti-gay legislation — including, as reported by TIME, voting against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which ""would have banned discrimination against people based on sexual orientation."" Pence has also spoken out against gay marriage.

Page stars in The Umbrella Academy which debuts Friday, Feb. 8 on Netflix.

Empire Co-Creator Lee Daniels, Fox Respond to Jussie Smollett Racist Attack

Smollett was attacked early Tuesday morning in a Chicago Subway restaurant by two men who beat him, allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs and said ""This is MAGA country,"" doused him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. The Chicago Police Department is investigating it as a possible hate crime and has released surveillance images of persons of interest.

Smollett's statement echoes many of the points made in his family's statement released on Thursday. ""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,"" the Smollett family said in part. ""Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable.

CHICAGO -- ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett issued a statement through a spokesman Friday in response to what he told police was a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago earlier this week. Here it is:

""Beautiful People,

Let me start by saying that I'm ok. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.

With Love, respect & honor...

Jussie."""

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on Friday stood behind allegations that two men savagely beat him in Chicago after hurling racist and homophobic slurs.

The 36-year-old actor — allegedly roughed up by two men early Tuesday when he went out for a bite to eat — told family, friends and fans that he appreciates their support.

""Let me start by saying that I’m ok. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you,"" he said in a statement addressed to ""Beautiful People.""

""The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

Chicago police said they are investigating Smollett's allegations as a possible hate crime.

A department spokesman revealed Thursday that Smollett refused to hand over his cellphone and cellphone records that could help investigators.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson told NBC Chicago that detectives won't demand the phone or records.

""The allegations as described to us are horrendous, horrible, and quite frankly cowardly,"" Johnson said Friday in response to questions at an unrelated news conference.

""He is a victim, and we treat him like a victim. He's been very cooperative,"" Johnson said. ""We are making gains in the investigation and hopefully we'll bring it to a successful resolution soon.""

""We have no reason to think he's not being genuine with us,"" Johnson said.

Smollett didn't address the cellphone issue in his statement, but insisted he is cooperating with police.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Smollett, who came out as gay in a backstage interview with Ellen DeGeneres in 2015, plays a gay character on the Fox hit ""Empire,"" said his attack was not an ""isolated incident.""

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett said Friday that he has been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation into what he says was a racist and homophobic attack on him in downtown Chicago earlier this week.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed rumors leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home -- including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck -- they haven't found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the ""outpouring of love and support"" he has received since the attack -- even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it ""horrible."" But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn't cooperated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett's refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.



Police have not suggested that Smollett or his manager have been untruthful in any way. On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said that even though detectives haven't found video of the attack, Smollett has been ""very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he's not being genuine with us.""

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn't be unusual that such an attack wouldn't be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn't provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don't continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

""Somewhere out there there's a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,"" he said, pointing out that the two aren't considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence."

In a statement to ""Extra"", Jussie said, “Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Earlier this week, Smollett, who is black and gay, was attacked by two white men in ski masks who allegedly pulled a noose around his neck, shouted racial and homophobic slurs, even pouring bleach on him, TMZ reported.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” the 36-year-old continued. “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.

Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me. With Love, respect & honor … Jussie.”

On Thursday, Jussie’s family released a statement about the incident, saying, “In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.”

“Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed,” the statement continued. “We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable.”

The family ended the note by emphasizing, “Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

The police are still in search of the two men thought to be involved in the possible hate crime.

Jussie is scheduled to perform songs from his debut album tomorrow night at the Troubadour in Los Angeles."

The attackers poured an “unknown chemical substance” over Smollett and wrapped a rope around his neck, according to investigators.

They shouted racial and homophobic slurs throughout the attack, police said. No arrests have been made.

Closing his statement, he said: “We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.

“Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Smollett has starred in Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terence Howard.

His Empire co-star Taraji P Henson is among the celebrities to have offered their support on social media.

As well as his acting, Smollett is also a singer and activist who has advocated HIV/Aids prevention.

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett said Friday that he has been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation into what he says was a racist and homophobic attack on him in downtown Chicago earlier this week.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven’t found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support” he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it “horrible.” But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn’t cooperated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett’s refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven’t found video of the attack, Smollett has been “very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.”

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn’t be unusual that such an attack wouldn’t be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn’t provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don’t continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

“Somewhere out there there’s a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,” he said, pointing out that the two aren’t considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence."

According to the Huffington Post, Tuesday, officials from Detroit Police Department confirmed that Officer Gary Steele had been reassigned while they investigate the video. The clip in question was taken after Steel pulled over Ariel Moore for having an expired registration and seized her vehicle.

Detroit station WXYZ reports that once Moore was told to exit the vehicle so it could be towed, she was offered a ride to her home but declined. The 23-year-old instead chose to walk a block home in below-freezing weather. That’s when the officer decided to poke fun at her plight and start filming her.

In Steele’s video the young woman can be seen walking away as one of the officers mocks her and says she is doing the “walk of shame.” Making the ill advised video even worse is the fact that stickers were added to the footage that read, “What black girl magic looks like” and “celebrating Black History Month.”

The racially charged clip ends with an officer saying, “Bye, Felicia,”

When the local news station showed Moore and her mother, Monique Mobley the video they were stunned.

“I’ve never had this happen to me in my life. I’m kind of shocked — I don’t really know how to feel right now. I’m still trying to take it in,” said Moore."

In a statement obtained by ABC News, Smollett says that he has been ""100% truthful"" with law enforcement authorities who this week said that the actor has refused to turn over phone records that could prove he was on the phone with his manager just before the attack. No arrests have been made, but police have released photos of two people of interest.

His statement comes a day after Smollett's family defended calling the attack a ""hate crime,"" which the family warned are happening with increasing frequency to LGBTQ Americans across the country.

""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,"" the family said in a statement Thursday.

""Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable.""

Chicago police said the day before that they had not yet found footage of the attack, but noted that blind spots existed among what they had found so far.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett said he is “strong” and is assisting Chicago authorities investigating an attack on him in the city’s Streeterville neighborhood earlier this week.

Smollett, who is black and gay, broke his public silence on the attack in a statement he sent to Essence, the magazine reported on Friday.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett said in the statement. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger.”

Smollett also addressed comments in social media that have been skeptical of his account of the attack early Tuesday.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” the statement said.

On Thursday, the family of Jussie Smollett released a statement saying the reported attack on the black and gay Empire actor in downtown Chicago this week was a ""hate crime"" and they pushed back against any suggestion that he has been anything but honest with police investigators.

Smollett's family issued a statement Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack. No arrests have been made.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox TV show filmed in Chicago, hasn't spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack in the city’s Streeterville neighborhood. He told police that he was talking on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack, but both of them have declined to give investigators their phone records, the Chicago Tribune reported. Skeptics on social media have raised doubts about the attack.

Smollett told police that he was walking home from a Subway restaurant when the attack occurred. Detectives have recovered surveillance footage of his walk home, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's manager called police about 40 minutes after Smollett got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

Detectives are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, and they have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack, Guglielmi said.

On Thursday, police released grainy photos of two ""people of interest"" who were in the area when Smollett said he was attacked. The photos showing two men from a distance came from surveillance video. Investigators said they want to identify and talk to the men.

Smollett's family and Underground's Jurnee Smollett-Bell released a statement on Wednesday condemning the attack, the perpetrators, and similar hate crimes (see below).

The Chicago Police Department confirmed that in the early hours of January 29, Smollett was beaten by two males who approached him while yelling ""racial and homophobic slurs"" at around 2 a.m. Tuesday morning in the 300 block of E. North Water Street.

Having returned to Chicago on a delayed flight from New York City, Smollett was assaulted by the two men, who proceeded to pour ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a rope around Smollett's neck before fleeing the scene. After reporting the assault to the police and sitting for an interview, Smollett drove to Northwestern Hospital for medical treatment. Under increased security, he returned to his home late Tuesday and is reported to be in good condition.

On Wednesday, police released images from a surveillance camera of potential persons of interest who are wanted in questioning in regards to the attack on Smollett and set up a community alert:

Here is the full statement from Smollett's family:

""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.""

Anthony Guglielmi, Chicago Police spokesperson reported that police asked Smollett to share his telephone records which would verify he was speaking to his manager when the alleged assault on him occurred. The actor refused to let police examine his phone.

Smollett’s manager told police he heard attackers yell “This is MAGA country” as the attack on Smollett was happening. Smollett did not originally tell police about the alleged incident. After this fact in the case broke in the press, Smollett told the police it happened in subsequent interviews.

Smollett’s family released a statement saying he has cooperated and his story has never changed. Everybody is hopeful they will find the individuals and justice will be served.

Police have reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance footage from 20 different cameras in the area, and have not been able to find footage of the attack. Guglielmi said they do have footage of Smollet walking two the Subway Shop and home.

Authorities released pictures from a surveillance camera of two people they would like to talk to, who happened to be in the area at the time the alleged attack took place. They are not considered suspects.

Police will not demand Smollett hand over his cell phone. They consider him a victim, and he has been cooperative.

Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, yet so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. However, he said they still need to collect and view more. Further, he said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

In a statement Thursday, Smollett’s family called the alleged attack a “hate crime” and pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

“His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time.

CHICAGO - ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett said Friday that he has been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation into what he says was a racist and homophobic attack on him in downtown Chicago earlier this week.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed assertions levelled on social media that he has been less than co-operative and changed his story.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven't found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the ""outpouring of love and support"" he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it ""horrible."" But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn't co-operated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett's refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven't found video of the attack, Smollett has been ""very co-operative and we have no reason at this point to think he's not being genuine with us.""

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn't be unusual that such an attack wouldn't be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn't provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don't continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

""Somewhere out there there's a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,"" he said, pointing out that the two aren't considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence."

His family have now released a statement on the incident and pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

It reads: ""This was a racial, homophobic hate crime ... We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings.""

They continued: ""These are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.""

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett 'attacked with chemical and had noose put around his neck by MAGA attackers in hate crime' in Chicago

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Jussie walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Jussie told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Jussie on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Jussie's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

SHOW TRANSCRIPT

Chicago police are still investigating the alleged assault on ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett, and new details have given us a better picture of the timeline.

Police disclosed to CNN Thursday that an envelope with a letter and white powder was sent to the Chicago set of the hit Fox drama on Jan. 22, prompting a hazmat response. Police declined to reveal the contents of the letter but said the powder turned out to be aspirin.

Exactly a week later, Smollett, a black and openly gay actor, said he was attacked by two men. They allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs and poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him while beating him.

At some point, one of the attackers reportedly tied a thin rope around the actor's neck. According to The New York Times, Smollett later told police the suspects yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" as they attacked him.

MAGA refers to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Smollett, who was on the phone with his manager as the attack happened, then retreated to a nearby hotel where his manager was staying.

Police requested Smollett turn in his cellphone to verify the phone call, but Smollett declined and police aren't going to force him to. The police department superintendent told NBC Chicago: ""He's a victim. We don't treat him like a criminal.""

On Friday, Smollett spoke out about the attack to Essence, saying he is OK and pushing back against rumors that his story has been inconsistent. He also said that these types of attacks happen to his ""brothers, sisters, and gender non-conforming siblings daily"" and should not be seen as an isolated incident.

Police are poring over hours of surveillance footage and have found images of two suspects, as well as footage of Smollett entering the hotel with a rope around his neck. They have not found footage of the attack itself.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. The 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Jussie Smollett has given his first public statement since being hospitalized after a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago late Monday night. “Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” the Empire actor said in a statement to Essence. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.” The Chicago police are currently investigating the attack — during which two people beat up Smollett, used racist and homophobic language, put his neck in a rope, and threw a chemical substance on him — as a possible hate crime. According to reporters, Smollett and his manager Brandon Z. Moore, who said he was on the phone with the actor, heard the assailants yell “MAGA country” during the attack. According to the police, they have not given over their phone records. “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett told Essence. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ”

After the attack Smollett’s family put out a statement referring to the attack as a “racial and homophobic hate crime,” which too often targets “many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities.” “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,” Smollett told Essence. “I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven’t found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support” he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it “horrible.” But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn’t cooperated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett’s refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven’t found video of the attack, Smollett has been “very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.”

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn’t be unusual that such an attack wouldn’t be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn’t provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don’t continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

“Somewhere out there there’s a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,” he said, pointing out that the two aren’t considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence.

Smollett told police that two masked men punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.



Smollett's family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.



Smollett's manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Smollett's family thanked the public Thursday ""for their prayers"" and said they are ""so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.""

""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,"" the family said.

They said such incidents will continue to happen until people are held accountable.

The area is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants and has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home, Guglielmi said. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hour-long drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels."

Smollett was attacked at around 2 a.m. Tuesday in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood when he said that two people began yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him. In a statement on Tuesday, the Chicago Police Department said a “cast member from the Fox series ‘Empire’ was injured in what police called a ‘possible racially-charged assault and battery.'”

On Thursday, the Chicago Police Department said that Smollett and his manager had not provided phone records that would help the department investigate Smollett’s case. However, in his statement Friday, Smollett addressed what he called “inaccuracies and misrepresentations” that have circulated in the days following the attack, saying that he is working with authorities.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett continued. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. “

On Friday, an individual close to the situation told TheWrap that Smollett was never specifically asked by police to specifically hand over his phone records. Rather, they “casually asked if he wanted to turn over his phone,” which Smollett was not comfortable doing. Smollett’s team has since offered to hand over his phone records, the individual said.

Smollett and his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, have told police that they were talking with each other on the phone when Smollett was attacked in Chicago early Tuesday. Smollett told police two men attacked him while yelling racial and homophobic slurs and referencing “MAGA,” according to police. A police statement said chemicals were poured on the “Empire” star’s face, and a rope placed around his neck.

On Wednesday evening, detectives released photos from a surveillance video showing “potential persons of interest” in the attack.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,” Smollett’s statement continued. “We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident but I need a moment to process.

Jussie Smollett released his first statement since the alleged hate crime which sent him to the hospital early Tuesday morning.

Smollett in his exclusive statement to Essence, said: “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.

It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Smollett told the police in an interview that his assailants yelled “MAGA country” during the attack. The Chicago Police Department confirmed this information and told E! News in a statement, “In the initial reports there was no mention of MAGA. When detectives followed up with [Smollett] later in the day, he recalled the offenders making those comments and detectives completed a supplemental report.”

Yesterday the Smollett family released the following statement: “In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.



With love & gratitude,



The Smollett Family”"

Jussie Smollett has broken his silence on the January 29 attack that left him hospitalized. In a statement provided to IndieWire, the “Empire” actor said he is doing ok and thanked his fans and the industry at large for an outcry of support in the hours and days after the attack first made news.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett said. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Smollett continued, “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

As confirmed by the Chicago Police Department, Smollett was approached by two men in the early morning of January 29. The offenders “yelled racial and homophobic” slurs at the actor and “battered [him] with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.” Later, one of the assailants “wrapped a rope around [Smollett’s] neck.”

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers, and non-gender conforming siblings daily,” Smollett’s statement concluded. “I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.

—Cory Booker announces presidential bid for 2020 election ‘Together, America, we will rise’

On Wednesday, prosecutors added threats and witness intimidation, in connection with the Sept. 7 incident. The woman claims she was brutally beat and choked by Bird while in his Massachusetts apartment. The woman said he would choke her until she went limp, then he would let her catch her breath before choking her again, ESPN reports.

“If you don’t stop talking I’m going to kill you,” the victim claims Bird said, according to court docs obtained by TMZ.

She also claims Bird told her: “Tell anyone about this, I don’t care where you are, I’ll find you and I’ll kill you.”

Police said the woman reported that Bird choked her unconscious, threw her against the wall and dragged her by the ankles when she tried to leave his apartment. The alleged victim said she escaped when Bird had a seizure-like attack and fell. He was hospitalized for a few days.

Bird has maintained his innocence.

“I’m taking some time away from the team as I deal with my legal and medical issues. I apologize to my family, the Celtics organization, my teammates, the fans and the NBA for the unnecessary distraction that I have caused,” Bird wrote in a September statement.

—Jussie Smollett Noose Video: Police have footage of ‘Empire’ actor with rope around his neck after brutal attack—

“The information that has been released does not tell the full story. I do not condone violence against women. I am hopeful that in due time and process, I will be able to regain everyone’s trust.”

Brian Kelly, Bird’s lawyer, said that the NBA player “understands the seriousness of the allegations.”

The Celtics said in September that the team’s “thoughts are with the victim.”

‘Pursuant to Domestic Violence Policy in the NBA’s labor agreement, matters of this kind are handled by the League Office, not the team, and so the Celtics will be working with both the league and local authorities to assist in their ongoing investigations,’ a Celtics spokesperson explained in a statement."

According to XXL, earlier this week, the Philadelphia rapper and his entourage were traveling in Kingston, Jamaica, and as they were leaving the city, they were stopped by authorities.

In what was possibly an attempt to make sure everything remained on the up and up, Meek instantly began recording his interaction with law enforcement. But he was audibly surprised when he realized that all they wanted was to take a picture – as fans!

The 31-year-old was so amused by the encounter he chose to share the moment on his Instagram Story.

“You’re trying to take a picture, mon?” he can be heard asking the police in a Jamaican accent. “I’m f***ed up! Y’all pulled us over and y’all said y’all want a picture, mon? Y’all scared us! We’re scared of police! We thought we were getting locked up!”

Given Meek’s well documented woes with the criminal justice system, it comes as no surprise that he and his team are weary when interacting with law enforcement. Fans were outraged when the emcee was sentenced to two to four years in prison for violations of a probation he was sentenced to back in 2009.

Seeing a young Black man in his prime put away for years, simply because he was seen on Instagram the day before doing wheelies on his bikes without a helmet, felt like a huge miscarriage of justice to both his fans and colleagues. After a public outcry, which was passionately endorsed by fellow rapper Jay-Z, Meek’s legal team was eventually able to obtain his freedom.

In the wake of that ordeal he’s made it his mission to help others who have less resources receive the same justice he was able to and recently the Pennsylvania Senate passed a bill inspired by his highly-publicized battles with probation.

Feb 1, 2019 • Post A Comment

In an impassioned late-night talk show appearance Thursday night calling out the media, Hollywood and political leaders, actress Ellen Page urged viewers to “connect the dots” in the wake of the “hate crime” against actor Jussie Smollett.

Appearing on CBS’s “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” Page aimed much of her anger at Vice President Mike Pence, saying: “If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering — what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street.”

She added: “I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f—ing stop.”

Here’s the clip, posted today by CBS …"

That gets people hurt and killed.

Actress Ellen Page delivered a fiery condemnation of the anti-LGBTQ bigotry that Mike Pence has supported throughout his political career and its dangerous consequences of it.

Page spoke during an interview on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" about how people are often hurt and even killed as a direct result of the rhetoric and policies championed by Republicans like Trump and Pence.

""The president and the vice president, Mike Pence,"" Page said, ""wishes I could not be married, let's just be clear.""

""The vice president of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy.""

For years Pence was at the forefront of anti-LGBT and radical social conservative policy while he served as governor of Indiana.

He opposed same-sex marriage. He was an advocate for gay conversion therapy. He even signed the so-called ""Religious Freedom Restoration Act,"" which allowed businesses in the state to discriminate against LGBTQ Americans.

Page connected Pence's hateful approach to the recent attack on actor Jussie Smollett. Smollett had racist and homophobic slurs yelled at him by attackers who poured what police called an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him. A noose was tied around his neck.

""Connect the dots,"" Page implored, ""This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them.""

""You go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they're going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street.""

""This needs to fucking stop,"" she concluded to loud applause.

Pence was added to Trump's presidential ticket to entice those who support his brand of bigotry to come to the polls and support the Republican Party.

In the presidency, Trump has actively courted bigots to keep them in line. He pushed for a Muslim ban on travel to the United States, wants to spend billions on a racist southern border wall, and is trying to ban transgender service in the military.

Trump, along with Congressional Republicans, also went all-in to install Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh is an opponent of reproductive rights and that was enough to ensure conservative support of his nomination despite credible accusations of sexual assault.

Trump even called Nazis ""very fine people.""

Trump is an unpopular president who is reeling from the negative press associated with his decision to shut down the federal government.

He reportedly plans to use his State of the Union speech to rally the Pence-aligned segment of conservatives to shore up his presidency.

Politico reports that Trump is telling allies ""he wants to incorporate firm anti-abortion language"" into his address and ""potentially include an anti-abortion figure among his list of invitees.""

The political calculation is clear. He's doing this because, as the outlet notes, he is hoping to ""energize his evangelical supporters"" and ""has maintained strong support from religious conservatives who might otherwise be turned off by his persona thanks to his administration’s attentiveness to their social-conservative agenda.""

Trump and Pence do not care if their support for such bigotry and intolerance hurts and kills people.

Page's speech exposed the dark cynicism hiding under the Trump-Pence ticket and the fact that the lives they hurt aren't theoretical. There are real people victimized for political gain.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CNN that the letter, received on January 22 at Cinespace Studios, where the show is filmed, prompted a response from the HAZMAT unit.

Guglielmi said authorities determined the powder to be asprin, but declined to give details on the content of the letter.

The FBI is leading the investigation into the letter, he added.

A spokesperson for 20th Century Fox Entertainment, which produces the series, declined to comment when reached by CNN.

More details

In Chicago, police continue their investigation into the alleged attack, which occurred near a lower entrance to the Loews Chicago Hotel.

Smollett said his attackers physically assaulted him and called him homophobic and racist slurs, according to police.

Smollett, who was returning from an early morning trip to a Subway sandwich shop, also reported that one of his attackers put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown substance on him, police said.

Investigators have video of Smollett entering the hotel after the alleged attack with what appears to be a noose around his neck, Guglielmi said.

Police are in possession of the rope and the sweater Smollett was wearing on the night of the attack and are testing the substance, according to Guglielmi.

Smollett and his manager, Brandon Moore, told authorities they were speaking on the phone with each other at the time of the attack, police said.

Guglielmi said because of the financial relationship between the two men, they are trying to verify the call took place and have requested phone records or the physical phones used for the call.

Police were called 30-40 minutes after the attack took place, Guglielmi said.

Detectives have collected and are reviewing more surveillance video from neighboring hotels and apartments, but have not found video of the incident at this point, Guglielmi said.

On Wednesday, police released photos of two individuals who are now wanted for questioning in connection with the case.

Smollett has starred on Fox's ""Empire"" since 2015. He plays Jamal, a successful singer in the musical Lyon family. Like his character, Smollett identifies as gay.

Family responds

On Thursday, the Smollett family condemned the ""violent and unprovoked attack,"" calling it ""a racial and homophobic hate crime"" in their first official statement since the incident.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning,"" the statement said. ""His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""

In the aftermath of Smollett's assault, his friends, colleagues and peers showed an outpouring of support for the actor, who is an active advocate for the LGBTQ community.

""Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time,"" the statement added. ""We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed."""

The “Empire” star, who was reportedly beaten by two men early Tuesday morning in Chicago in what is being investigated as a possible hate crime, released a statement to Essence on Friday addressing the “beautiful people” concerned for him.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett said. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Smollett responded to apparent misinformation being spread about his attack and his co-operation with police online.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett continued, “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he concluded. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Chicago Police are currently looking for two persons of interest wanted for questioning in the assault, in which Smollett was allegedly beaten, had an unknown chemical substance poured on him, had a rope wrapped around his neck, and had slurs shouted at him. It was also reported the two men allegedly yelled, “This is MAGA country.”"

A court has fined two amateur gay adult film performers after they filmed themselves having a threesome on the London subway and then uploaded the video to the internet.

Last month, 35-year-old George Mason and his 24-year-old Nicholas Mullan pled guilty to one count each of “outraging public decency” after being filmed having “full sex, oral sex and masturbation in the presence of the traveling members of the public”.

The video was shot in February 2018 for HungYoungBrit.com, a company that specializes in amateur point-of-view gay x-rated movies.

The men’s attorney, Howard Cohen, said it was recorded on a whim as they were on their way back to Mason’s flat after a day out.

“During the course of the journey, the idea came about that they would have sexual relations on the train,” Cohen said.

Police were unable to locate the third man in the video.

Now, Judge Lucinda Lubbock has ordered Mason to pay a fine of £1,000 ($1,300 U.S.). Meanwhile, Mullan was ordered to pay £170 ($220 U.S.) costs and perform community service."

In his statement Friday, obtained by USA TODAY, Smollett, 36, wrote: ""Let me start by saying that I’m ok. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

Numerous celebrities have written Smollett messages of support, including his co-star Taraji P. Henson, who vowed on Instagram, ""Hate will not win.""

Smollett also expressed concern with how his case was being reported in the media, noting, ""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level."" But, he said, ""despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

He also reiterated a point made by his family in their statement Thursday: ""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.""

In closing, Smollett promised fans: ""We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.""

In their remarks, Smollett's family also stressed that hate attacks will continue ""until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions.""

While updating the media on the case Thursday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives had recovered surveillance camera footage of Smollett arriving home at his apartment with a rope around his neck. He said the video was recorded minutes after the actor said he was attacked.

But he noted that investigators still have still have not found footage of the assault itself, which took place in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood about 2 a.m. CST Tuesday. Meanwhile, police have released several images of ""potential persons of interest"" whom they seek to question.

In addition to placing a rope around his neck, Smollett said, his attackers poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and used racial and homophobic slurs. (Smollett, who is black and gay, later told police his assailants yelled “This is MAGA country!”)

In recent days, Smollett indicated he still plans to perform a scheduled concert in Los Angeles this weekend.

A person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it confirmed Smollett's performance plans to USA TODAY.

Early Tuesday morning, Smollett was accosted by two white men as he exited a Subway sandwich shop after a late-night flight from New York to Chicago. The men reportedly addressed the actor using anti-gay and racist slurs, put a noose around his neck, and screamed, “This is MAGA country!” Chicago police, who are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, have released surveillance images of possible persons of interest in the case, while celebrities across Hollywood and the political landscape have spoken out to support Smollett and condemn the attack against him.

Smollett addressed his statement to the “beautiful people.”

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” he wrote. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett continued. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

In the wake of Smollett’s attack, his family released a statement as well, in which they insisted that Smollett’s attack was a targeted hate crime. “Make no mistake,” his family wrote, “words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

Smollett echoed that sentiment in his own statement, noting that “these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.

“We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he wrote. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.” He signed the statement with “love, respect & honor.”

He also addressed misinformation circulating about the incident, dispelling rumors on social media that his story has changed.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” the 35-year-old actor said.

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” Smollett’s family added.

As previously reported, Smollett alleged that he was approached by his attackers, who were yelling racial and homophobic slurs, around 2 a.m. Tuesday. They then proceeded to assault him, pouring an unknown chemical substance that could be bleach on him before wrapping a rope around his neck. He was briefly hospitalized Tuesday before being discharged.

Chicago police have scoured surveillance footage from cameras nearby and released photos of two people of interest in the case. No arrests have been made.

On Thursday, President Donald Trump condemned the attack against Jussett, calling it ""horrible.""

""I think that's horrible. It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned,"" he told reporters.

Smollett is reportedly still on for his Los Angeles concert on Saturday, where he is scheduled to perform at the famed West Hollywood venue the Troubadour."

The significant statement (read it in full below) released on the beginning of Black History Month is the first time Smollett has publicly spoken out on the incident, which occurred on the chilly streets of the Windy City in the early hours of Tuesday.

Having put out video surveillance images of what they call “people of interest” in the violent attack on Smollett by two as yet-unidentified individuals, local law enforcement tells Deadline they are going through responses and tips from the public. “We have received a lot of information from citizens based on the photos and are focusing resources on the most serious ones,” an individual involved with the FBI-assisted case says.

Smollett had just returned from New York to Chicao where the Fox drama is shot, and was on the street near his apartment at around 2 AM when two men began bellowing derogatory slurs toward him. The two then attacked Smollett, hitting him over and over and pouring an unknown chemical substance over him. They reportedly also put a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene.

After reporting the incident to police and conducting an initial interview with them, Smollett drove himself to Northwestern Hospital. He returned to his home under increased security later Tuesday and was said to be in good condition, police said.

Chicago police announced very quickly Tuesday that they are treating the matter as a “possible hate crime.” Yesterday, Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi called the incident an “assault and battery case.”

There have been reports that the attackers were either wearing Donald Trump-inspired red “Make America Great Again” caps ,or during the assault screaming “this is MAGA country” at the actor, who plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon on Empire. Smollett’s music manager Brandon Z. Moore has said he heard the attackers’ comments while on the phone with the performer during at least a portion of the attack. There have also been claims Smollett’s version of events have changed in the hours and days since he initially spoke to police. We hear, as Smollett notes in his statement today, that it not the case.

Also, Chicago police and other law-enforcement agencies investigating the matter have not confirmed any MAGA-related reports. Other sources close to events say that the apparently male attackers were not wearing hats with the Trump slogan on them, and Smollett has never said they were.

On Thursday, Trump himself called the assault “horrible” when asked about it by White House reporters.

Depending on his recovery and weather conditions, Smollett could be back filming Empire by early next week. The performer is still scheduled to play a concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on Saturday.

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent?

Jussie Smollett has given his first public statement since being hospitalized after a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago late Monday night. “Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” the Empire actor said in a statement to Essence. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.” The Chicago police are currently investigating the attack, during which two people beat up Smollett, used racist and homophobic language, put his neck in a rope, and threw a chemical substance on him, as a possible hate crime. According to reporters, Smollett and his manager Brandon Z. Moore, who said he was on the phone with the actor, heard the assailants yell “MAGA country” during the attack. According to the police, they have not given over their phone records. “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett told Essence. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ”

After the attack Smollett’s family put out a statement referring to the attack as a “racial and homophobic hate crime,” which too often targets “many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities.” “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,” Smollett told Essence. “I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”"

In a statement to Essence, the Empire star said, ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger.""

On Tuesday morning, the LGBTQ+ activist was attacked by two men after leaving a Subway restaurant. Chicago police confirmed that a noose was found around the actor’s neck and he had an ""unknown chemical substance"" thrown on him. After suffering injuries, Smollett went to a nearby hospital and was later released.

He concluded, “With Love, respect & honor… Jussie.”

Smollett's statement echoes much of what was expressed in his family's earlier words. That reads:

“Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country.

In the wake of accusations of fabrication and support from colleagues and fans, the family has declared the attack on Smollett an act of “Domestic Terrorism.”

The family’s statement is listed below courtesy of Billboard:

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack,” the statement reads. “We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time.

We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country.

Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

Chicago police are still investigating the crime and are piecing together surveillance video of two persons of interest in the case. Smollett is also cooperating with police in order to find the men who carried out the alleged assault.

Per the Chicago Police Department, which is investigating the incident as a hate crime, Smollett was walking down the street early Tuesday morning when two individuals approached him and began yelling racial and homophobic slurs. The offenders then became physically violent, battering the actor with their hands and pouring an “unknown chemical substance” on him, per the CPD. At some point during the altercation, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene.

The actor also told police that the perpetrators referenced President Trump’s rallying cry, “Make America Great Again,” during the attack, per The Hollywood Reporter. (Trump later called the incident “horrible.”)

In a statement to Essence, Smollett began by assuring fans that “I’m OK,” adding that “my body is strong but my soul is stronger.”

Though the actor expressed frustration with “certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread” since the attack, he remains grateful for the community’s support and reiterated that such “cowardly attacks” happen often in the LGBTQ community.

“I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,” Smollett said. “We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.”

Earlier this week, Smollett’s family also released a statement, calling the violence a “racial and homophobic hate crime.” Read Smollett’s full response below:

The Empire star then went on to reveal that he is working closely with the authorities to make sure that the people who assaulted him are brought to justice.

“I still believe that justice will be served,” he stated adding that the racial and “non-gender conforming” attacks are happening to others “daily,” and that his attack should not be looked at as an isolated incident, but open up a much bigger conversation in the country, promising to address the details after he has had some time to “process” what has happened to him.

“Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief, and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Jussie Smollett was assaulted by two masked men this week after leaving a Subway restaurant. The men allegedly got the actor’s attention by calling out homophobic and racial slurs, and then proceeded to pour a chemical substance on him, hit him with their hands, and wrap a rope around his neck.

He was taken to the hospital and released with minor injuries. One of the most shocking parts of the story is that Jussie had reportedly received a threatening letter before the attack.

Inside Edition reported that police have seen security footage from that night and found that two men dressed in black could be persons of interest in the investigation.

The report went on to reveal that Jussie told cops that the assailants wore ski masks over their faces, and used phrases like, “This is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make American Great Again.”

Following the attack, Trump spoke out about the incident, calling it “horrible,” and claiming that as far as he is concerned, it “doesn’t get any worse.”

Jussie Smollett has received a ton of love and support from fans, family, and other stars since the incident."

Dawson and Booker have been seen together at several public events in the last month; Dawson has yet to acknowledge Booker’s presidential run.

On January 29, though, Dawson did retweet a tweet by Booker that condemned the hate crime perpetrated against actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. Dawson appears to be following Booker on Twitter (along with a number of other politicians, including Rep. Ted Lieu and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez).

Here’s what you need to know:

1. Dawson Told Booker ‘I Love You’ During a Meet-and-Greet on Broadway, per People

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe. To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention. https://t.co/EwXFxl5f2m — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) January 29, 2019

According to People, Dawson sang to Booker during a cast meet-and-greet for Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway in early January. She even said “I love you,” a source told the magazine.

The publication reports that Dawson and Booker were attending the performance together, and that Dawson made up a little tune on the spot to tell the politician she loved him. It was Booker’s second time seeing the show, and Dawson’s first, and People reports that the pair were joined by Booker’s niece and Dawson’s daughter.

As People notes, Booker and Dawson both follow one another on Twitter and Instagram.

2. Dawson & Booker Were Seen Attending a Movie Together in Early January

Per Page Six, Dawson and Booker were also seen together in early January attending a movie at Regal Union Square. The source was not able to confirm what movie the pair saw, but did say to the publication, “He literally almost ran me over when he was racing around the corner to get to the concession stand before the movie started.”

The publication also notes that Booker and Dawson have known each other for years, given Dawson’s political activism.

3. Dawson Supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Election; She Has Not Endorsed Anyone for 2020

Dawson endorsed the candidacy of Bernie Sanders for the 2016 election, and was active on the campaign trail for him, as seen above.

In an introduction for Sanders in March, 2016, as seen in the video above, Dawson said,

“We need someone who has bold leadership, who understands that with climate change, with health care, with education, with our future at stake, that we need bold leadership from someone we can trust. Someone who has stood up for justice his entire life. They haven’t listened to him, but we are, and we need to keep spreading that message because people are voting against themselves. They are voting against their future, and we need to help them, because this is about us.”

4. Dawson’s Last Relationship With Eric Andre Ended in 2017

Per People, Dawson’s last relationship was with comedian Eric Andre, and it lasted for a year before they split in 2017.

Dawson and Andre were known for having a very private, low-key relationship, but she did open up about him from time to time. In an Instagram on September 17, Dawson wrote about how supportive Andre was in the wake of a surgery she had to undergo after a cyst on her ovary ruptured.

Dawson wrote, via People, “What a difference a year makes… This weekend marks a year that I had to get emergency surgery to stop internal bleeding from a ruptured cyst on my ovary. It was the first time I told (Eric) that I loved him (and very much not the last). Thankful for his care and all of the doctors and nurses and staff at the Desert Regional Medical Center.”

That Instagram is no longer available.

5. Booker Has Been Connected With Chanda Gibson & Cleo Wade Romantically in the Past

Though he has never commented on either of these relationships, Booker has been affiliated with both Chanda Gibson and artist Cleo Wade in the past.

Gibson is a former executive director of the Council of Urban Professionals who worked with Booker on his mayoral campaign. According to her LinkedIn page, Gibson now works at DREAM, a nonprofit that helps youths in East Harlem, the Bronx, and Newark.

Wade is an artist, author, and influencer known for her inspirational messages on Instagram and in her books. Booker has actively talked about Wade and referenced her as a “close friend.” Via The Washington Post, they have taken vacations together and collaborated on work together, but have never confirmed a romantic relationship."

According to a police report, the two unknown suspects attacked him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck. The offenders, who Smollett claims yelled “this is MAGA country,” fled the scene; the actor and singer eventually transported himself to Northwestern Hospital and has since been discharged.

Smollett’s family, which includes his sister, Friday Night Lights star Jurnee Smollett-Bell, spoke out Thursday, condemning the “cowardly attack.” Smollett concluded his own statement: “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers, and non-gender conforming siblings daily.

But here we are—with much of Twitter speculating he's lying about a hookup gone awry.

The oppression Black members of the LGBTQ community face—whether it’s homophobia from the Black community, racism from the white LGBTQ community, or a combination from white and other people outside of both these communities—is unique.

“Black men loving Black men is a revolutionary act.”

I often think of this quote from the late Black queer writer and activist Joseph Beam. I have come to love my queerness and my Blackness. Together, not separate, neither wholly inextricable from my person. It is not the entirety of me, but it’s much of me.

I have thought constantly about that quote recently, when news broke earlier this week that Empire actor and singer Jussie Smollett was hospitalized in Chicago, reportedly after a brutal attack in Chicago by two white masked assailants.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on TV and identifies as a gay man in real life, claims that the assailants uttered racist and homophobic invectives, shouting “MAGA country!” while striking him in the face and fracturing one of his ribs. The attackers also allegedly placed a noose around Smollett’s neck and doused him with an unknown chemical (officers later reported that they smelled bleach on Smollett’s clothing). Smollett’s music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, was reportedly on the phone with Smollett at the time of the attack and corroborates the actor’s account that the men were shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Even fame, wealth, and success are not a shield. Bigots wants to silence us, make us shrink in fear, or literally snuff us out of existence. This incident throws into sharp and sad relief that living openly as a Black queer person remains a revolutionary act—and how hard it is for many Americans to empathize with a Black gay man or to acknowledge that hate crimes are not aberrations. They are not rare or exceptional events, but part of this country’s social fabric.

Soon after the media reports begin, insinuations that Smollett was lying came hard and fast. Why was he out on the street in the early a.m.? Clearly, his questioners believe that little good or honest happens after midnight, though many of them have had the munchies. Right-wing conspiracy theorists called the attack as “another phony hate crime,” according to AlterNet. Credible media outlets are using speculative language like “possible hate crime.” Yes, credible media outlets are professionally bound to use words like “allegedly” when describing crimes, but those tentative references to “possible hate crimes” are far more frequent, far more insidious, and deeply dangerous when the victim is queer.

The day after the attack, several media outlets also (for reasons I cannot deduce) felt it necessary to report that police had yet to find surveillance footage of the attack or any possible suspects, fueling rumors that Smollett was not truthful about the incident. This, despite the fact that the investigation is still ongoing and the police did find surveillance video of possible suspects later that same day. There were no recorded signs of any interaction with Smollett, though cameras can’t catch everything.

Queer men especially are used to speculation that violence or threats against us somehow have to do with sex. It had to have been a hookup or sex play that went terribly wrong. Usually, it’s our fault for “inappropriately” soliciting sex from cishet men (as some have baselessly speculated about Smollett). Of course, in this toxic patriarchal society, men often respond to real or imagined solicitation by lashing out with anger. A simple “No, thank you” would do.

Never mind that Smollett received threatening hate mail filled with racist and homophobic rhetoric on the set of Empire a week before the attack. Or that marginalized communities have historically been targets of violence in America. Or that since Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, there has been a noted uptick in hate crimes. Racially motivated hate crimes have risen by about 15 percent and hate crimes based on sexual orientation have risen by nearly 20 percent, according to data released by the FBI. Yet, people still question whether white men commit premeditated or impulsive hate crimes against LGBTQ folks or people of color. Smollett is just blaming “MAGA rednecks,”or so the story goes.

These theories that Smollett is making up the attack—because he needs more attention than a hit show and music can give him, apparently—is culturally sanctioned gaslighting. What a regrettably predictable response to any marginalized person’s accounts of bigotry or bias: It must be exaggerated or imagined.

I can relate to how incidents of aggression or violence are immediately followed by questions of what queer men were doing to court trouble. As a 14-year-old high-school freshman almost 20 years ago, I was targeted by an older boy who didn’t like the way I looked at him in the locker room. His anger and fear took the form of shouted invectives in the locker room after gym class and harassment that sometimes became physical shoving on our shared bus route. It continued for weeks before he moved onto a smaller, weaker target after I finally told him to leave me alone (using less polite language).

Then just last year, I went clothes shopping with my roommate at a local store and was nearly physically attacked by a man who insisted (incorrectly) that I had been following him through the aisles and “checking him out.” He, too, shouted several racist and homophobic epithets at me. The store employees did little to handle the situation; one asked me if I was indeed following him before addressing the man who attempted to push me into a nearby clothing rack.

It’s also worth mentioning that the shopping incident happened in the “liberal” city of Los Angeles, dispelling the myth that the danger of being Black and queer is any less in cosmopolitan centers than it is in more rural or suburban areas. Hate crimes in the country’s largest cities increased for the fifth consecutive year in 2018, indicating a problem possibly exacerbated by the Trump administration, but that existed before his presidency. In Los Angeles specifically, hate crimes rose by 13 percent from 2017 to 2018, with most of those crimes being committed against members of the LGBTQ community, Black people, and Jewish people. This despite more media representation and perceived acceptance of both Black and queer faces and voices.

Hypervisibility doesn’t make Black queer people any safer. Being in a large city center doesn’t make Black queer people any safer. Jussie Smollett being a wealthy, attractive, talented famous actor in a big city doesn’t make him less vulnerable. Being Black and queer—just existing—remains a revolutionary act.

Smollett has owned his Blackness and his queerness since Empire thrust him into the spotlight. And whether you believe his story—and I do—the avalanche of speculation that he’s lying and the refusal to understand those intertwined identities are an attack on both of those identities. While discussing the attack on a panel on Wendy Williams’ talk show, radio host Rickey Smiley went to great lengths to condemn white supremacy, but made no mention about the obvious homophobia Smollett reported as part of the attack. Comedians Ellen DeGeneres and Kevin Hart both separately offered words of support for Smollett on social media, neither specifically calling out racism nor homophobia. All the more galling in this case was that Hart had nothing more to say, after the recent media maelstrom regarding his homophobic tweets about inflicting violence on his son if his child were gay. I didn’t expect much from DeGeneres either, after she conducted an unchallenging interview with Hart and forgave him for remarks against a community she’s not even a part of—queer Black men. This is not OK.

I understand the feelings behind the flattening of the nuances. We want to make things uncomplicated. But this is an important and necessary moment to talk about intersecting systems of oppression. The oppression Black members of the LGBTQ community face—whether it’s homophobia from the Black community, racism from the white LGBTQ community, or a combination from white and other people outside of both these communities—is unique.

I think about the fear I felt in the store last year when a white man larger than me was incensed by my Black queerness. It didn’t feel entirely dissimilar to the fear I felt as a teenager when an older boy made me the target of his fear-based homophobia and racism.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told WLS-TV, abc7 News, on Friday morning that Smollett ""has been very cooperative and we have no reason, at this point, to think that he's not being genuine with us.""

""I will say this. The crime that he reported is horrendous. It's horrible. It was cowardly. We'll do everything we can,"" Johnson said.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police he was attacked early Tuesday by two people, who shouted racial and homophobic slurs and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, according to The Chicago Tribune. One of the alleged attackers reportedly put a rope around his neck.

The FBI is assisting in the investigation after it was confirmed that an earlier threat was made against the actor in the form of a letter before the Tuesday morning incident.

A security video has revealed two ""potential persons of interest"" who Chicago police want to question. Police released stills from surveillance video of two shadowy figures.

Brandon Z. Moore, Smollett's music manager, has revealed he was on the phone with the actor when he heard some of the attack.

Smollett has reportedly declined to hand over his phone to police, but is willing to provide phone records, according to TMZ."

Since the attack, Smollett’s family has released a statement, and the actor has spoken out in Essence and on stage, when he performed Saturday night (February 2) at the Troubadour nightclub in West Hollywood, California. It was his first concert since the attack. Clarifying the circumstances of the assault, he said he’d been bruised but his ribs weren't cracked, and that he went to the doctor immediately but wasn't hospitalized. Reading from a piece of crumpled paper, he added, “Above all, I fought the fuck back.” Watch footage below.

When self-described tiny Canadian Ellen Page was orginally booked as a guest on last night's Late Show With Stephen Colbert, everyone no doubt expected the former Juno star to be plugging her two new projects The Umbrella Academy and the mini-series Tales of the City.

Things started out light enough with Colbert pulling out a recent photo of Page and her wife Emma Portner, who were married last January. That led to talk of the way that women are treated in Hollywood, with Page describing the beginning of her career as being marked by all kinds of sexist, misogyinist, and generally gross incidents.

After moving on to global warming, things started to get really heavy when Page turned to the recent beating in Chicago of Empire star Jussie Smollett, who is gay. Describing the attack as a ""hate crime"", she proceeded to get rolling.

Page suggested that people connect the dots between such incidents and the way that U.S. President Donald Trump and notoriously anti-gay Vice-President Mike Pence have treated the LGBTQ community specifically, and those they don't agree with in general.

As Colbert and the audience listened without making a sound, she called out Pence and Trump with the following: ""If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them—you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you can meet. I am lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.""

Colbert sat there listening intently, after which the equally appreciative audience gave Page an extended ovation.

Watch the segment here, where Page at one point said ""I'm really fired up tonight"". And yes, by the end of her appearance, she did get around to talking about The Umbrella Academy."

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett has broken his silence after a racist and homophobic attack sent him to the hospital. The 36-year old actor who had a noose wrapped around his neck and was doused with bleach says he’s OK but is still processing what happened.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett said in an exclusive statement to Essence on Friday. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words,” he added.

There have been false and inaccurate reports, mostly from right wing media, which Smollett challenges in his remarks.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” he says.

The attack was not captured on surveillance footage but Smollett was seen entering his apartment building moments after it happened with a rope around his neck.

He was on the phone to his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, when he was jumped and Moore corroborated his story earlier this week.

A week before the attack, Smollett reportedly received a homophobic and racist death threat in the mail.

It was sent to the studio where he films Empire and is said to have terrified staff.

Police are working to find two men they believe may be responsible and are appealing to the public for information.

Smollett's neighbor has also described seeing two suspicious 'redneck' types standing outside their luxury apartment building 90 minutes before the attack took place.

One had a rope hanging out of his sweatshirt, she said, and they looked out of place.

Smollett had not long arrived back in Chicago from New York City when he was attacked.

His flight was delayed by several hours leaving and he documented his frustration about the late arrival on Instagram before he got home.

He was filmed on surveillance cameras leaving the Subway at around 2am and walking towards the apartment.

Police on Thursday confirmed that he was filmed on the same street as the two persons of interest whose images have been released at one point during his journey home.

The 36-year-old actor was walking down the street and the two men were sitting on a bench facing opposite him.

Smollett and his manager Brandon Z. Moore both told police they were on the phone when the attack happened. Moore said he heard the attackers yell 'this is MAGA country'. It is not clear if he is the person who called 911 or if it was someone else but Smollett refused to hand over his phone when police asked for it to verify that they had been on the phone

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, that appears to be dated from January 18, stating that 'You will die black f*g'. Fox Studio received the letter on the 22nd and cops said it was laced with powder Tylenol

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

They got up and walked away and all three walked out of the cameras' view.

Smollett was picked back up by a different camera 60 seconds later as he entered his apartment building.

He had the rope around his neck and there was salt on the front of his sweatshirt from the ground.

At 2.35am, an associate of the actor's called 911 and officers arrived at an apartment where he was at 2.42am.

It is not clear if it was his apartment that they went to or his friend's.

After giving his statement, Smollett took himself to hospital where he was treated for lacerations to the face.

The attack took place here, in the street, outside the apartment building where Smollett stays while he is in Chicago filming. It is in between two luxury apartment buildings and two hotels but police say they have not yet recovered surveillance footage of it

Smollett, 36, who is also a singer, is due to perform on Saturday night in Los Angeles

Police had asked him to turn over his phone for them to verify that he had been on a call with his manager, as both claimed, when the incident happened but he refused, saying he was uncomfortable doing so.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Gugliemi told DailyMail.com on Thursday that it was not suspicious for him to have refused doing so and that he may have been concerned with privacy.

He has been entirely cooperative otherwise, he said.

The attack has enraged the country and caught the attention of the president who deemed it 'horrible' on Thursday.

'That's horrible....there is nothing worse, as far as I am concerned,' Trump said on when asked about the incident.

Smollett's famous family released a statement abhorring the attack and countless celebrities, including his Empire co-stars, have also spoken out to support him.

He is due to perform a show in Los Angeles on Saturday night."

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett said in an exclusive statement to Essence. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger.""

Smollett was hospitalized on Tuesday following an alleged assault by men who reportedly called him racist and homophobic slurs and attempted to put a noose around his neck (he also told police that one of them shouted, ""This is MAGA country!"" per THR).

In the days that followed, celebrities and fans expressed their support for him and his family and insisted on justice for what the police are investigating as a hate crime.

""More importantly I want to say thank you,"" Smollett's statement continued. ""The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

On Thursday, Smollett's family released a statement condemning the attack as domestic terrorism and cautioning against the power of hateful rhetoric.

Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions.

Smollett reiterated in his statement that he is working with the authorities to bring his attackers to justice, which he believes is possible even with ""frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread.""

On Empire, Smollett plays Jamal, the middle son of Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) who faces adversity for being a gay singer in the rap community. Smollett himself is a vocal activist in the LGBTQ+ community.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.

And just days before the kickoff of the biggest game of the year, federal investigators announced that 33 people have been arrested in connection with sex trafficking charges.

According to reports, Atlanta is known as the number one city in the country for sex trafficking.

Sex trafficking is reportedly a $290 million a year business in the United States.

—Jussie Smollett Noose Video: Police have footage of ‘Empire’ actor with rope around his neck after brutal attack—

The 33 arrests are from the past four days as the surge of activity has increased in the city, according to Nick Annan, Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge, The AJC reports.

Annan however would not reveal details of the cases since it’s an on-going investigation.

“We plan to continue what we’re doing,” Annan said.

On Sunday, the Los Angeles Rams and New England Patriots will face off in Atlanta at the Mercedes-Benz stadium.

With more than one million people from all over the world expected to converge on Atlanta during the Super Bowl LIII weekend Feb. 3, earlier this month, local Uber drivers were given lessons on how to spot sex trafficking victims.

The training, held at the Uber office with about 70 drivers, shed a light on how a big event like the Super Bowl can be a big draw for bad people.

“Whenever you have lots of people coming in with disposable income, you are going to have human trafficking,” said Deborah Richardson executive director of the International Human Trafficking Institute in an interview with Channel 2 News.

Richardson noted that spotting a victim can come in various forms like a suspicious demeanor or how they’re dressed.

“Trafficking victims are not often dressed appropriately for the season or the time of day,” she said.

Richardson noted people can call and report suspicious activity at 1-888-373-7888 or text 233733."

""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" the 36-year-old actor stated.

Chicago Police told Fox News on Thursday they continue to sift through hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in the high-end area of downtown Chicago where the alleged incident occurred on Tuesday morning but they still haven't found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

""As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,"" the actor concluded. ""Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.""

Smollett, who is African-American and gay and plays the openly gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, told police he was beaten by two men who subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope was draped around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

'EMPIRE' ACTOR JUSSIE SMOLLETT HOSPITALIZED AFTER ATTACK; POLICE INVESTIGATING AS POSSIBLE HATE CRIME

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the timestamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he explained.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the actor and his manager declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Meanwhile, police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose images police released to the public late Wednesday. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have information that could be useful to the investigation.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

'EMPIRE' ACTOR JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S FAMILY RELEASES STATEMENT AS POLICE CONTINUE TO SEEK FOOTAGE OF ALLEGED ATTACK

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Now Smollett has released his first public statement to Essence following the assault.

""Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett said. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you.

TMZ reports Smollett he will likely address the assault on Saturday, Feb. 2 during a scheduled performance in Los Angeles. Smollett arrived in L.A. on Thursday (Jan. 31), and will play at the Troubadour. The concert was originally scheduled before the assault took place, and it would appear as though he's committed to seeing it through regardless of his injuries.

The assault left Smollett with a fractured rib, but he was dismissed from the hospital relatively quickly. He's reportedly still suffering from a number of cuts and some swelling, but he's not letting it get in the way of the show.

After police expanded the investigation area into the assault against Smollett, Chicago PD released two images of persons of interest in the attack. The hooded individuals, who appear to be wearing masks in the photos, match the description Smollett gave to police."

On Tuesday, just hours after news broke that Smollett had been attacked in Chicago, DeGeneres took to Twitter to join the round of celebrities and fans speaking out about the attack.

“Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show,” DeGeneres wrote, referencing Smollett’s 2015 appearance in which he confirmed his sexuality. “I’m sending him and his family so much love today.”

Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show. I’m sending him and his family so much love today. ❤️ — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 29, 2019

Tweeted at 5:30 p.m., the talk show host’s message was not only criticized for the late response, but also for DeGeneres’ failure to speak out about the nature of the crime, which is currently being investigated “as a possible hate crime” due to its racist and homophobic nature, with many dubbing the message nothing but a plug for her show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

“Maybe something better would have been ‘it was a privilege to have personally witnessed Jussie coming out 4 years ago, I’m sorry I ended up redeeming a man that promoted the very language that resulted in Jussie’s assault. I failed him, and especially the black lgbtq community,’” one person wrote.

“Really inserting your show here?” another person questioned. “It’s just sad. What about the guy who joked about beating his kid if they were gay that you forgave for all of us? Jokes like that make this type of violence possible. You’re part of the problem Ellen.”

Twitter users also slammed DeGeneres’ message as being tone deaf, as it was only weeks ago that she offered Kevin Hart a platform to speak about his Oscars fiasco. Having decided to step down from the gig due to backlash from past homophobic comments, including one statement in 2011 in which he stated he’d physically harm his son if he came out as gay, DeGeneres voiced her support for Hart accepting the gig again.

“And less than four weeks ago, you sat across from Kevin Hart and said ""Don't let those people win.” But “those people” whom you described as “haters” were queer black people hoping that you’d take the relationship between language and violence more seriously,” one person wrote.

That same person later added that he fully expects “the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks. Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart.”

Smollett has not yet spoken out regarding the attack. While no suspects have been apprehended, the Chicago Police Department recently released to photos of persons of interest in the crime."

Although it was confirmed by his family that he is safe and recovering at home, the actor is now breaking his silence to reassure his fans that he is fine. In an exclusive statement to Essence addressed to the “beautiful people,” Jussie said,

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. ”

He added,

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Jussie also said that although he’s dealing with trauma, grief and pain, he will address all details of this horrific incident soon.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he concluded. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

He ended by signing off, “With Love, respect & honor…Jussie.” Police has identified the two suspects after obtaining surveillance footage from Jussie’s apartment in Chicago. Police haven’t shared any further details but we will continue to keep you updated when more have been shared.

Ellen Page, who came out as a lesbian in 2014 and has since married to Canadian dancer Emma Portner, saved her particular disdain for Vice President Pence, pointing out his long-held positions in support of traditional marriage and religious liberty.

“The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife,” Page explained, showing a picture of the couple together. “If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street.”

“I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this,” the Juno star continued. “This needs to fucking stop.”

“The urgency would be so severe. But instead, we have a media that’s barely talking about it. We have a media that says it’s a debate that whether or not what happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd. Its not a fucking debate,” she ranted, urging people to “connect the dots.”

Last year, the 31-year-old actress also lashed out at First Daughter Ivanka Trump after she posed for a photo with evangelical pastor Jim Garlow, sharing a post referencing his belief “marriage equality is a satanic plot to destroy the image of God.”

“Don’t ever act like/pretend to support lgbtq+ people ever again @IvankaTrump People like your father, # MikePence, the gentleman you took a photo with and YOU are perpetuating horrible suffering and preventing equality from being realized,” she wrote at the time. “Shame.”

Cory Booker (D-NJ) called on the House of Representatives this week to pass legislation that would designate lynching a federal hate crime — re-upping the bill, which passed the Senate in December, in response to an alleged attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

Smollett, who is famous for playing a gay character on the popular Fox television program, alleges two men beat him as they near his Chicago apartment complex. Smollett claims the attackers yelled, “Aren’t you that faggot ‘Empire’ n***r?” at him, while his manager, Brandon Moore, told the police that he heard them tell the actor, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett also told police the men placed a thin rope around his neck before fleeing the scene.

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe,” Booker tweeted on Tuesday. “To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention.”

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.

The bill — Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018 — was originally introduced in June by Booker, Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Tim Scott (R-SC). The bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in October and passed through the Senate by unanimous consent on December 19.

“Today is an emotional and historic day,” Booker said after the bill’s passage. “For over a century, members of Congress have attempted to pass some version of a bill that would recognize lynching for what it is: a bias-motivated act of terror. And for more than a century, and more than 200 attempts, this body has failed. Today, we have righted that wrong and taken corrective action that recognizes this stain on our country’s history.”

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Anti-Defamation League, and the Equal Justice Initiative have championed the bill."

“The actor declined to share telephone records that could show he was speaking with his manager just as the alleged assault happened early Tuesday morning in Chicago,” a spokesman for the police told the far-left NBC News.

A source speaking to TMZ, however, says Smollett did not refuse to turn over his phone records and “is in the process of gathering them.” Smollett did, though, refuse to hand over his phone, saying he was “uncomfortable” doing so.

“A representative for the actor did not immediately return messages seeking comment about the cell phone and phone records,” adds NBC.

According to various news reports and police, Smollett says he was assaulted by two men as he returned home from a fast food restaurant in the heart of downtown Chicago at around 2 a.m. Tuesday morning. Smollett claims the two men recognized him from his TV show and confronted him while hurling racial and homophobic slurs (Smollett is black and gay).

Smollett told police that during the assault the men poured bleach on him, said something about this being “MAGA country,” and tied a noose around his neck.

The phone records are important because they can verify a key part of Smollett’s story. The Empire star told police he was on the phone with his manager during the attack and the manager told police he heard the attack and someone exclaim, “This is MAGA country.”

“MAGA country” is a reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan. The alleged assault is being investigated as a hate crime.

As of now, police say they have pored through countless hours of surveillance video and have no record of the assault.

Late Wednesday night, police did release grainy screenshots from surveillance video of two “persons of interest” who were near Smollett at around the same time the alleged attack took place.

At no time, though, are the persons of interest seen on the same video camera as Smollett, or even on the same side of the street. In fact, police have not even confirmed the timing of the video of the persons of interest, so we have no idea if they were seen in the area at the exact same time as Smollett or around the same time.

We also don’t know if the persons of interest are at any time seen running or hurrying away from the area, or if they disappear for the same 60 seconds Smollett does. Surveillance video of Smollett’s walk home loses track of him for 60 crucial seconds. The next time he is seen on video, according to police, is when he enters a condo building where a friend lives. Police say this video clearly shows a “rope” wrapped around Smollett’s neck “like a necktie.”

Smollett is seen on the video ignoring the building security guard. He enters the elevator and about 40 minutes later the police are called.

Police did observe scrapes on Smollett’s face and neck. He took himself to the hospital, where he was treated for the abrasions. There are conflicting reports about whether or not he suffered a cracked rib.

Still unexplained is why Smollett didn’t just show police the display from his phone that would verify the call with his manager. It makes sense he would not want to turn over his physical phone. But you can prove the time and date of your calls at a glimpse without going to the trouble to gather your phone records.

Jussie Smollett is speaking out days after he was viciously attacked in Chicago early Tuesday morning.

The Empire star was reportedly beaten by two men, who allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs during the horrific incident, just after leaving a Subway restaurant. There was also a noose found around the actor’s neck, and he was covered in an unknown substance, which many say was bleach.

Here’s what he had to say on Friday, via Essence:

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you.

We truly hope the men responsible are caught.

As Jussie said, these targeted attacks are happening all over the country right now, and we MUST come together.

At a Thursday press conference at the White House, April Ryan, Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks, asked the president about the alleged assault, but he offered just a short response.

“That I can tell you is horrible,” he said. “I’ve seen it. Last night. It’s horrible. Doesn’t get worse.”

View Trump’s comments on Smollett below.

The president did not address police reports that Smollett, who is gay, told them his attackers shouted “racist and homophobic slurs.” Similarly, he didn’t address the claims that his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” had been cited by the attackers during the assault.

Instead, Trump used the question to delve into a discussion about immigration from Mexico and to make a renewed call for a wall to be built along the U.S.-Mexico border.

“What I think is the worst sin of all is the fact that we’re allowing people to come into this country and sell drugs and human traffic and do all of these horrible things,” the president said. “If we had the simplicity of a well-constructed, beautiful barrier or wall, they wouldn’t be able to come into our country.”

“That, to me, is the great sin,” he added.

Prior to Thursday, the White House had been criticized for staying silent on Smollett’s attack.

A number of top Democrats ― including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Senator Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden ― had voiced their support for Smollett on social media shortly after the news broke.

The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all. — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) January 30, 2019

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery.



This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country.

At around 2 a.m. in Chicago on Tuesday, Smollett transported himself to the hospital after he was the victim of an apparent hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed in a statement that a member of the hit Fox show was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery.”

“Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” continued the statement. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

In a statement, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face or any despicable act of violence and hatred — and especially against one of our own.”

The Fox show’s creator, Lee Daniels, also spoke out about the incident, calling the actor his “son” and saying, “It’s just another f—ing day in America.”

Smollett’s family also released a statement on Thursday.

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” they said. “Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.”

On Wednesday, Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi released an update on the case, revealing that investigators have acquired footage that could lead to the arrests of the Empire actor’s assailants. The police also released two photos of the persons of interest, however, the images did not show the individuals’ faces.

Smollett first spoke publicly about being gay on the Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2015, though he said he never considered himself to be in the closet."

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett told Essence in an official statement. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

He did make a point to note how the disgusting attack is bigger than him; it’s not an isolated incident. The 35-year-old actor-singer vows to use his platform to discuss the ongoing issues that plague the LGBTQ+ community and the intersections within it, but of course, he needs time to process the trauma he’s experienced.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,” he said. “I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.

The “Empire” star, 35, allegedly was beaten by two masked men after leaving a Subway restaurant, where he had purchased some food. A source told Page Six that one of the biggest misconceptions about the attack was that Smollett never handed over his cell phone records from the night.

“Jussie was asked to hand over his phone and he did not feel comfortable doing that,” the source said. “He has since offered to hand over his phone records.”

Despite contradictory reports, police also confirmed that a rope was tied around the actor’s neck and that Smollett was cooperating in the investigation.

Regarding his condition, Smollett confirmed to Essence that, “I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger.”

Smollett signed his statement by writing, “With Love, respect & honor…Jussie.”

The LGBTQ activist’s family issued a statement of their own on social media that showed their unwavering support for him and the community.

“Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall,” the family wrote. “We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”"

Smollett continued, ""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ""

He concluded by saying, ""As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

Jussie Smollett's family released a statement on Thursday, saying in part, ""“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender nonconforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Often times ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable.""

Smollett's sister, Jurnee Smollett Bell, added, ""Because there’s a light in him that cannot be dimmed, because we are a family of joyful warriors, we will not let this get the best of us,” she wrote along with posting a family photo. “Although this is a picture from happier times, this is the spirit to which we chose to move forward…they will not steal, our joy.""

Page condemned not only the attack, but also a government that she said has at least tacitly encouraged this violence.

In her nine minutes sitting across from Stephen Colbert, Page spoke passionately on a number of issues including climate change, which the actress said the media is not covering sufficiently. Additionally, Page called the media cowardly—“saying it’s a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime.” In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked by two white men who were reportedly wearing ski masks, and who put a noose around his neck while using anti-gay and racist slurs. At one point, the men reportedly screamed, “This is MAGA country!” Chicago police have said they’re treating the attack as a possible hate crime.

“It’s absurd,” Page said. “This shit isn’t a debate.”

“Sorry,” she added. “I’m really fired up tonight. But it feels impossible not to feel this way right now, with the president and the vice president, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married. . . . He wanted to ban [gay marriage] in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt L.G.B.T.Q. people so badly as the [governor] of Indiana.”

At that point, Page turned her attention back to Smollett, who has received an outpouring of support from Hollywood as well as some politicians since his attack. Page said that she doesn’t know Smollett personally, but that she sends all her love. Page then launched into an urgent speech directed squarely at Washington.

“Connect the dots,” Page said. “This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them—you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering—what do you think is gonna happen? Kids are gonna be abused, and they’re gonna kill themselves.” Page’s voice began to break as she continued: “And people are gonna be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world, and I have met the most marginalized people you could be. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this: this needs to fucking stop.”

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent? And at different moments...you're seeing the yin and yang of that, the positive and negative of both. Both are just trying to love this child."

In the days since Jussie Smollett was ruthlessly attacked in Chicago, he’s largely been overwhelmingly supported by both his peers in Black Hollywood as well as the black and gay communities BUT there have been a few folks who have expressed doubts about his story. Late Thursday Jussie’s family posted a statement simultaneously showing their support for their brother. Here’s the message from Jurnee:

In the meantime, a source for TMZ is attempting to clear up a few misconceptions about the attack, clarifying that Jussie Smollett did not refuse to hand over phone records to cops but that cops “informally asked” Jussie if he would surrender his phone to verify he was talking to his manager on his cell when he was attacked.

The source says he felt “uncomfortable” doing that and declined, but he was never asked about phone records. One Chicago police official said Jussie refused to turn over both the phone and records but the source close to Smollett says he’s already agreed to provide his phone records and is currently gathering them.

The source also says that some reports state that Jussie told cops his assailants were wearing MAGA hats, however Jussie never said the men were wearing the hats – just that they screamed “MAGA country.”

Lastly it’s been reported that Jussie kept rope around his neck long after the incident when he was being treated at the hospital, but that’s not actually the case. Sources say he did have the rope around his neck when cops arrived at his building 42 minutes after the incident and that he kept it there to “preserve the evidence.”

Jussie broke his silence Friday morning with the following statement to ESSENCE

Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ” As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he concluded. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me. With Love, respect & honor…Jussie

Prayers up to him and his family — we hope justice is served.

“He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBT so badly as the governor of Indiana,” the 31-year-old “Juno” star told host Stephen Colbert.

Pence's office denied in a statement last year to The Hill that the vice president supports ""gay conversion therapy.""

Page also cited the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett during her impassioned remarks while promoting her new Netflix series, “The Umbrella Academy.”

Smollett, who stars on Fox’s “Empire,” told police in Chicago that two men approached him on Tuesday and yelled racist and homophobic slurs, before placing a rope around his neck.

“I don’t know him personally. I send him all of my love,” Page said, her voice rising. “Connect the dots. This is what happens.”

“If you are in a position of power, and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, and you go through the trouble.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Smollett’s manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven’t seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett’s description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

The area is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants and has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett’s walk home, Guglielmi said.

It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” Trump told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn’t far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where Empire is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama Empire follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry.

Jussie Smollett is finally speaking out after the homophobic and racist attack he endured earlier this week.

The Empire star and LGBTQ+ activist was beaten by two men early Tuesday morning in Chicago, police said in statement, just after leaving a Subway restaurant. Police added that a noose was found around the actor’s neck. Smollett was able to transport himself to the hospital after suffering injuries.

In an exclusive statement addressed to the “beautiful people,” Smollett not only assured fans that he’s recovering, but that he’s thankful for the mass outpouring of support he’s received over the last few days.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett began in his statement to ESSENCE. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. ”

In his statement, Smollett also addressed the misinformation that has been circulating about the incident, and dispelling rumors on social media that his story changed.

Smollett said, “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ”

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he concluded. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Smollett signed his statement by writing, “With Love, respect & honor…Jussie.”

In a statement released Thursday, Smollett’s family echoed much of his statement, saying they are standing by their “beloved son and brother.”

“Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed,” the family’s statement read in part. “We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country.”

Their statement concluded, “Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”"

Page was ostensibly on the show to promote her new Netflix series The Umbrella Academy, but within minutes, she had turned the conversation to the problem of environmental racism and how climate change disproportionately affects people of color. “This is something that’s happening, and it’s happening to the most marginalized people, and we need to be talking about it,” she said. “It’s really serious.”

“Talking about it,” Page said, should not include debates about whether climate change is a real thing. “The urgency is so severe, and yet we have a media that’s barely talking about it,” she said. “We have a media that’s saying it’s a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd! This shit isn’t a debate.”

From there, she connected the dots between what happened to Smollett — who, according to police, was beaten by men shouting racist and homophobic slurs who wrapped a rope around his neck — and the anti-LGBTQ policies of both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

“This is what happens,” she said. “If you are in a position of power, and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering — what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves. People are going to be beaten on the street.”

There’s data to back up Page’s claims. A study last year by Loyola University Chicago School of Law professor Stephen Rushin and University of Alabama at Birmingham economics professor Griffin Sims Edwards found that Trump’s rise to power was associated with “a statistically significant surge in reported hate crimes across the United States,” even after they controlled their data for other possible explanations.

“It was not just Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric throughout the political campaign that caused hate crimes to increase,” they argue. Instead, “it was Trump’s subsequent election as President of the United States that validated this rhetoric in the eyes of perpetrators and fueled the hate crime surge.”

The Big Bang Theory may only have ten episodes to go, but the future of the universe may be expanding after all.

Kelly Kahl, the CBS entertainment president, has revealed that she’s open to the idea of another spin-off of the show, following the success of Young Sheldon.

When asked about whether or not they’ve spoken to Chuck Lorre about a potential new series to add to the Big Bang Theory world, Kahl told Deadline: Nothing formal [has been discussed]. The ball is in squarely in their court. If they want to talk to us about it, we are here to listen.’

Looks like there could be reason for fans to celebrate! (Picture: CBS)

So…we could be seeing more of the gang after all? Or at the very least, be seeing what some of them are getting up to in the future.

Rati Gupta, who plays Anu, is a newcomer to the series, having become the perfect match for Raj after being introduced by their parents.

She previously told Metro.co.uk that she was unsure about whether or not a spin-off was the right move for the show, after it was announced that Jim Parson’s exit was the spark that lit the finale fire.

Could there be life after the Big Bang Theory? (Picture: CBS)

‘There are great characters [in The Big Bang Theory] and if they found a way to do it that would be great, but at the same time, 12 years is a long time to play a character so I also completely understand Jim’s [Parson] decision and the others if they feel like doing other things,’ Rati explained.

‘I get that.’

With the show hurtling towards its final episode at an alarming rate, the cast and crew have not been shy about how sad they’re feeling about the series ending.

Johnny Galecki, who plays Leonard on the show, broke down in tears when he was asked to say goodbye to the character for Entertainment Weekly, and added that he hoped the show’s final script would factor in tears because he knew they would be coming.

The Big Bang Theory airs Thursdays on CBS in the US, and at a later date on E4 in the UK.

The claims relate to his Roc Nation hat line.

Jay-Z is not one to shy away from bringing diversity to center stage. The multi-award winning rapper and music mogul just won his legal battle to have six Black candidates included on the arbitration panel handling his trademark dispute, Page Six reports.

The rapper turned businessman argued in the suit that there wasn’t one Black arbitrator on the Association’s national “Large and Complex Cases” roster.

The suit stated that the roster consisted of one Asian-American, one South Asian and one Latino representative. The Association has now promised to consider 11 Black candidates for the roster.

Jay-Z stated that minority business owners should have the opportunity to choose from a group that “reflects the diverse population,” Page Six states. Jay-Z argued the membership deprived Black litigants, like him, “equal protection of the laws”.

In new court papers, attorney Alex Spiro, who represents Jay-Z, said his client wants the case discontinued since the organization “offered the parties the option of working with AAA Senior Vice President Harold Coleman, who is African-American, in a mediation of their disagreement”

The American Arbitration Association provided Jay-Z the option of five additional Black arbitrators, according to his lawyer. They have, however, not commented about Jay-Z’s win to force them to diversify their ranks.

Thursday night, while promoting her upcoming Netflix series the Umbrella Academy, Ellen Page paid the Late Show with Stephen Colbert a visit. The conversation never really got to the new show—instead, around the two- minute mark, Colbert brought up the first time he interviewed her, five years ago, not long after she came out. The conversation shifted to the topic of Hollywood’s inclusion of LGBTQ actors (or lack thereof) and without missing a beat, Page responded :



“There’s clear evidence that [Hollywood] has changed, that there’s some progress. There’s some more representation but I honestly think we need to hurry up. It’s not cutting it. Hollywood, and the film industry in particular, is just so binary and it is so, I find, narrow in its ideas of who can tell stories and who can be in the stories. I hope it continues to change.”

She then turned her attention to “the media that is saying it’ s a debate whether what happened to Jussie Smollett ”— the out Empire actor who was violently attacked Tuesday morning in Chicago— “was a hate crime, ” before discussing the beliefs of Mike Pence, and the immediate, clear through- line between homophobic rhetoric and violence:

“I’m really fired up tonight but it feels impossible not to feel this way right now with the President and the Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married, let’s just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love [I have] with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana. I think the thing we need to know—and I hope my show Gaycation did this, in terms of connecting the dots between what happened with Jussie, I don’t know him personally, I send him all of my love—[is how to] connect the dots. This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves. People are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I’m lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.”

Nine years on from Queen of Denmark, the record that was to transform his musical career, John Grant remains a force to be reckoned with.

A tall, bear-like figure, tonight topped off with a baseball cap and star-shaped face paint in the style of the rock band KISS, he possesses a honeyed baritone and a searing honesty that refuses to mellow with age.

In truth, his 100-minute set at Leeds Academy starts a little slowly, with Grant and his band, who include former Siouxsie and the Banshees drummer Budgie, appearing to be finding their feet while working their way through a succession of AOR ballads that channel his inner Elton John – albeit the Rocket Man with added cuss words.

Grey Tickles, Black Pressure, Jesus Hates F*****s and Smug C*** all contain cutting lyrical phrases but none of them has quite the killer chorus of his best work. It takes a switch to wonky electronica in the song Metamorphosis, from his latest album Love Is Magic, for things to seem musically energised.

Grant tells of his horror at reading reports of a racist and homophobic attack on the American actor Jussie Smollett, eliciting a supportive response from the audience. After Pale Green Ghosts he thanks them for cheering him up.

Indeed it’s the songs from that second solo album that really stand out here. It Doesn’t Matter To Him and Black Belt take on a life of their own live, while Sensitive New Age Guy is preceded by a devastating monologue about an English teacher friend of his whose life descended into alcoholism, depression and ultimately suicide after he came out as a transvestite. “That’s the kind of song you’re going to get out of me,” Grant deadpans.

Glacier is astonishing, with Grant’s marvellous voice in full flow as he delivers heartfelt lines such as “Don’t listen to anyone/Get answers on your own/Even if it means that sometimes/You feel quite alone”."

On Thursday, just three days after Smollett was attacked by two masked men while exiting a Subway restaurant in Chicago during the early morning hours, his family is speaking out against the “cowardly” crime that left the actor hospitalized.

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack,” the family said in a statement to PEOPLE.

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the statement continues. “Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.”

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” Smollett’s family added.

“Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable,” they concluded. “Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world. With love & gratitude, The Smollett Family.”

According to reports, Smollett alleged that he was approached by his attackers, who were yelling racial and homophobic slurs, at around 2 a.m. They then proceeded to assault him and pour an unknown chemical substance, believed to be bleach, on him before wrapping a rope around his neck.

In their efforts to identify the suspects, the Chicago Police Department scoured surveillance footage from cameras nearby and announced Wednesday that their search had been successful. Alongside two photos of the persons of interest, Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote that “detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.”

Smollett has not yet spoken out regarding the incident."

Recently, we saw this with the Brett Kavanaugh allegations, the “Covington Catholic” fiasco, and every winter and summer a debate over whether man-made global warming/climate change is real (as a conservative, it has always seemed strange to me that liberals often seem to desperately want to believe that really horrible things have happened).

In some ways, budding news stories have become like unidentifiable plants just emerging from the soil, with one side invested in the ultimate result being a potato, and the other a tomato. Instead of trying to figure out what the truth is, partisans on both sides actively root, prematurely, for their side of the story to be the “winner,” with all the facts seen through the prism of their own biases and easily cherry-picked to conform to their own sense of moral superiority.

We are seeing this happen yet again when it comes to the reaction to the allegations made by Empire actor Jussie Smollett that, after receiving a threat in the mail, he was the victim of a heinous hate-crime assault earlier this week in Chicago. Smollett’s story has particular political resonance because he is a black, gay, liberal, celebrity, and his story makes it clear that he was attacked by two supporters of President Donald Trump who were motivated by racism and homophobia.

Immediately, a huge portion of the liberal media and political establishment rushed to Smollett’s side, expressing extreme outrage over the horrendous events which he described. Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressional Super-Celebrity Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted unequivocal support and umbrage over what they were instantly certain had happened, even expressing confidence that they knew exactly why it had occurred.

To their way of thinking, there was really no other way of looking at this story. The allegations were outrageous and the person making the allegation checked far too many political correctness boxes for anyone among the liberal media/political elite to resist being blinded to any other possible narrative.

At the same time, conservatives like me, immune to Smollett’s super-high “PC Protection Score,” were at least somewhat skeptical of this story with so little corroboration and whose details seemed bizarre. So, this happened at 2 a.m. on a frigid Chicago night? The perpetrators were carrying bleach and a rope with them, just happened to recognize Smollett in the dark, got intensely trigged by his race and sexuality, and declared that Obama’s hometown is “MAGA country” during the attack?!

Strange things happen all the time, but this story, at least as originally conveyed by TMZ, is really hard to wrap your head around. Of course, so is the idea that a celebrity on a hit TV show would ever make up, or perhaps even just exaggerate, the details of such a horrific experience.

But because the dangers of expressing public cynicism about a situation where the establishment has already invested themselves in what happened, conservative reaction to this story was, at first, largely muted (even Trump eventually expressed vague outrage over the story). That started to change when the Chicago police began to release information inconsistent with the original narrative.

When the police proactively leaked that surveillance video of the incident, which given its prominent location would have been expected, had not yet emerged, this changed the equation for many of the conservative cynics. Why would the Chicago PD go out of their way to publicize this fact, and risk the wrath of the virtue-signaling Twitter mob, unless they were having strong suspicions of their own?

This perspective was momentarily stunted when late Wednesday news broke that police finally had found video of some persons of interest (the New York Daily News erroneously tweeted, and then deleted, that video of the actual attack had surfaced). Online, I saw liberals instantly latch onto this as proof that their faith in Smollett had been justified, as they prepared to declare victory over their conservative foes who had dared to question his story.

But when the actual photos were posted on Twitter, the tide quickly turned again. All that was revealed were two unidentifiable dark blobs — with no signs of a rope or bleach — walking away from the scene of the apparent crime, up to thirty minutes before it happened. To conservatives, this was consistent with the police frantically trying to show that they were bending over backwards to substantiate a story they had reason not to believe, while, conversely, many liberals seem to see it is a sign that the police were going to cover up what really happened here.

Perhaps the fact about the case which falls most into the category of a “Rorschach test” is that Smollett and his manager apparently say that they were on the phone together (at 2 a.m. Chicago time?!) when the attack occurred, but the actor has so far refused to allow access to his phone or calling records so that this can be confirmed. To conservatives, this is a strong sign that the call didn’t take place and that Smollett’s story may be falling apart. Meanwhile, liberals are far more likely to see this simply as a celebrity victim seeking privacy, and that the inherently suspect cops are wrong to not take him at his word.

What is particularly weird about all of this is that it comes right on the heels of the Covington Catholic story, where the biography of those involved, rather than the facts, largely dictated how each political group perceived, or misperceived, what had actually occurred. And yet, here we are with everyone making the exact same potential mistakes yet again.

I honestly don’t know what, if anything, really happened to Smollett and it wouldn’t shock me if some sort of attack did indeed take place. However, I am confident that, if a white, male, Trump-supporter who was a non-celebrity made this exact same allegation against someone of Smollett’s profile, the reaction of liberals and the news media would be to laugh out loud and ignore the whole thing. Similarly, if Smollett wasn’t a black, gay, anti-Trump celebrity, conservatives wouldn’t be so eager, like fans cheering against a hated sports team, to see his story be debunked.

Unless a huge break happens very soon, my guess is that, much like the “unsolved” mystery surrounding a 2017 hate crime reported by NBA star Lebron James, we are never going to know for sure what really did or did not happen here. There will be enough “evidence” for each side to believe what it was that they always wanted to in the first place, but not enough for anyone to ever be brought to justice. Similarly, very few people in any sort of authority will have a vested interest in definitively disproving the story if it is significantly false.

If so, this story will be the perfect metaphor for our badly-broken modern media culture. A tale where everyone is sure they know what happened, but no one really does.

One chef at a California restaurant recently deleted a tweet stating that they’d refuse to serve anyone wearing a MAGA hat. This led CNN to wonder: Is refusing to serve someone wearing a MAGA hat kind of like refusing to make a cake for a same-sex wedding?

It may sound like a dumb question, but it comes up a lot. In May 2018, transphobic alt-right podcaster Gavin McInnes claimed that MAGA hat wearers are treated as badly as gay people were in the 1950s, but it ain’t true. (While MAGA hat wearers occasionally get booted from bars and eateries, none have ever been tossed in jail just for hanging out with others like them.)

Related: Caitlyn Jenner spotted in “Make America Great Again” hat days after Trump’s transphobic attack

Lemon asked attorney Chris Cuomo about the chef’s deleted tweet, and Cuomo compared anti-MAGA discrimination to the discrimination a same-sex couple faced when refused service by the Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado in 2012.

Cuomo says it’s technically legal to refuse service to MAGA hat wearers, since some people view the hat similarly to t-shirts reading, “I hate black people.”

Referencing the Masterpiece court case, Cuomo said, “Well, that was about refusing service to a group of people that should be a protected class, and unless you could argue that Trump supporters should be a protected class, I don’t think you have much of an argument on that. So let’s say this isn’t so much about whether he has the right, it’s about whether or not it is right.”

Gay people and Trump-supporters experience different sorts of discrimination, but the institutional discrimination gay people face is much older and more widespread. Also, comparing gay people with Trump-supporters views each as a “chosen lifestyle” with a chosen set of “political beliefs.”

But most gay people feel they themselves are “born that way” whereas MAGA hat wearers “choose to be that way” even though MAGA hat wearers claim to “have no choice” but to support Trump because “the truth” compels them to, even though the guy lies about 10 times a day.

In short, homophobia and anti-MAGA discrimination aren’t even remotely similar. But while Lemon doesn’t think MAGA hat wearers should be banned from public places. he also understands that anti-MAGA ire goes far beyond mere anti-conservatism or disagreement with Trump:

Your clothing tells a story about who you are, what you think about, and what you represent. And also, life is not in a vacuum. That hat means a lot of things. If you’re gonna wear that hat – maybe that hat means the Central Park 5 to people, maybe it means birtherism to people, maybe it means Mexicans are rapists to people. So you cannot erase those things from the story of that hat and say, ‘well I’m just wearing it because I want stronger immigration.’ A lot of people want stronger immigration. It can’t just be about what you want it to be about.

That being said, the chef deleted their anti-MAGA tweet after they allegedly started receiving death threats from Trump supporters. The business owner of the Masterpiece Cakeshop and the same-sex couple in that case both allegedly received death threats as well. Oh, America."

Actor Ellen Page called out the Trump administration Friday during an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, saying it fostered a climate of hate in the US — specifically for Americans who identify as LGBT. Page, who stars in the upcoming Netflix series The Umbrella Academy, addressed the attack on actor Jussie Smollett, who is gay. Smollett told police he was assaulted Monday by two men. The Empire actor said they yelled ""This is MAGA country"" and put a rope around his neck. ""It's absurd,"" said Page, who was upset about people debating whether or not to classify Smollett's purported assault as a hate crime. ""The [expletive] isn't a debate."" Police said they were treating the case as a possible hate crime ""given the severity of the allegations."" Page said she was ""fired up,"" and added that it was ""impossible to not to feel this way right now with the president and the vice president, Mike Pence, who, like, wishes I couldn't be married, let's just be clear.""

""The vice president of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife,"" said Page, who recently celebrated one year of marriage with her partner, Emma Portner. ""He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy,"" she said of Pence. ""He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana."" Pence has opposed same-sex marriage in past, and once supported a proposal to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act only to ""ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus."" Some have taken this to mean that the former governor supports conversion therapy, a claim he has denied.

Jussie Smollett

A woman has claimed she saw a white ""redneck"" man, with a length of rope or clothesline, loitering outside Jussie Smollett's apartment building in Chicago, Illinois, hours before he was viciously assaulted.

The Empire star was beaten and had a noose tied round his neck by masked men in a racist and homophobic attack in the early hours of Tuesday.

According to editors at TMZ, the unnamed woman, who claims to be a neighbor, alleged she saw a suspicious man, who looked like a ""redneck,"" pacing agitatedly outside the star's building as she took her dogs out for a walk at 12.30 a.m. - 90 minutes before Smollett was ambushed.

""He looked out of place,"" she said. The woman also said he had a length of blue and white rope or ""clothesline"" hanging out of his zip-up sweater. And she saw another man about 300ft away standing nearer the entrance and described being ""creeped out"" by the loitering men.

After waking up to news of the attack, the building's concierge advised her to call the police, which TMZ confirmed she did.

Her description of the men came hours after Chicago Police Department released still images of two persons of interest and Smollett's representative, Brandon Z. Moore, confirmed the actor's account that he was attacked by two masked men who screamed ""this is MAGA country"" after calling him a ""n**ger"" and a ""f*ggot.""

Smollett was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for his injuries, which included a fractured rib, reports The Blast, before being discharged.

Cops are investigating the assault, but have yet to identify the suspects or make any arrests in the case.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" reads a police statement issued to The Hollywood Reporter."

""If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering,"" Page charged.

""What do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you can meet. I am lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.""

Page was referring to her VICELAND show ""Gaycation,"" during which she traveled to several countries around the world and interviewed anti-LGBTQ extremists.

""Sorry, I’m really fired up tonight, but it feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married, let’s just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy,” Page told Colbert.

Page said Pence ""has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana, and I think the thing we need to know, and I hope my show 'Gaycation' did this in terms of connecting the dots, in terms of what happened the other day to Jussie [Smollett], I don’t know him personally, I send all of my love, connect the dots.”

Investigators have located a surveillance camera that shows people who are now wanted for questioning, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement on Twitter. Detectives had not yet found still images or video of the actual incident as of late Tuesday evening, police told CNN.

Smollett said he was attacked in the early morning hours on Tuesday in a Chicago neighborhood known as Streeterville by two people who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"" and ""poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,"" according to police.

Smollett reported that one of his attackers also put a rope around his neck, police said. Smollett told police both attackers fled the scene.

Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital and was in ""good condition"" in the hours following, authorities said.

CNN's Don Lemon spoke to Smollett and a mutual friend who was at the hospital with the actor. Smollett confirmed the incident took place.

He was shaken and angry that an attack like this could happen. Smollett told CNN he fought back at the attackers.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" police said in a statement Tuesday.

Investigators are testing the chemical Smollett said he was doused with and have yet to confirm the nature of the substance.

As of late Tuesday, detectives had canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders.

A dozen police detectives, with the assistance of the FBI, are working the case, the spokesperson said.

Smollett has starred on Fox's ""Empire"" since 2015. He plays Jamal, a successful singer in the musical Lyon family. Like his character, Smollett identifies as gay.

In the aftermath of Smollett's assault, his friends, colleagues and peers showed an outpouring of support for the actor, who is an active advocate for the LGBTQ community."

What is LGBT History Month?

LGBT History Month in the UK is every February, and in October in the US and Canada.

It’s a celebration that encourages further education into LGBT+ issues, the history of the gay rights movement, and promotes an overall safer and more inclusive society where the varied spectrum of sexuality and gender is universally accepted and spoken about openly.

The theme this year is Peace, Activism and Reconciliation.

When did LGBT History Month begin?

The first LGBT History Month happened in the US in 1994, and the UK didn’t join in until 11 years later in 2005.

It began as a result of a Schools OUT project initiative that started with teachers and activists Sue Sanders and Paul Patrick.

Schools OUT is an organisation which seeks to make schools safe and inclusive for LGBT+ students.

The first LGBT History Month wound up sparking over 150 events across the country in it’s first year, and the rest, as they say, is history.

What does LGBTQIA stand for?

This acronym stands for ‘Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex, and Asexual’.

The first four are fairly common parlance now, however there can be some confusion about the last three.

Questioning simply applies to anyone who is currently in doubt as to their sexual identity.

Intersex applies to anyone who is born with any number of variations in characteristics that can typically be found in both sexes.

These can include sex hormones, genitals and chromosomes that don’t fit the ‘typical’ definition of what is usually seen in men and women.

Some people can go their whole lives without realising that they are intersex.

Anyone who identifies as asexual will not experience sexual arousal at all.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett said he is “strong” and is assisting Chicago authorities investigating an attack on him in the city’s Streeterville neighborhood earlier this week.

Smollett, who is black and gay, broke his public silence on the attack in a statement he sent to Essence, the magazine reported on Friday.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett said in the statement. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger.”

Smollett also addressed comments in social media that have been skeptical of his account of the attack early Tuesday.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” the statement said.

On Thursday, the family of Jussie Smollett released a statement saying the reported attack on the black and gay Empire actor in downtown Chicago this week was a ""hate crime"" and they pushed back against any suggestion that he has been anything but honest with police investigators.

Smollett's family issued a statement Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack. No arrests have been made.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox TV show filmed in Chicago, hasn't spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack in the city’s Streeterville neighborhood. He told police that he was talking on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack, but both of them have declined to give investigators their phone records, the Chicago Tribune reported. Skeptics on social media have raised doubts about the attack.

Smollett told police that he was walking home from a Subway restaurant when the attack occurred. Detectives have recovered surveillance footage of his walk home, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's manager called police about 40 minutes after Smollett got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

Detectives are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, and they have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack, Guglielmi said.

On Thursday, police released grainy photos of two ""people of interest"" who were in the area when Smollett said he was attacked. The photos showing two men from a distance came from surveillance video. Investigators said they want to identify and talk to the men.

During an appearance on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show Thursday night, Ellen Page gave an emotional speech reminding viewers that LGBTQ+ people are under attack every day and that a culture that puts homophobic politicians in power is the root of the problem.

The actress, who was appearing to promote her new Netflix show Umbrella Academy, began by talking about the imminent dangers of climate change. “If it was a movie, we'd have Bruce Willis in a suit, like talking about something — please cast me,"" she joked. ""Please, Amy Adams, save us.""

She added that climate change isn’t up for debate, and neither is the attack on Jussie Smollett. But, as Page explained, it’s impossible not to feel the impact of Smolett’s attack as a queer person in this political climate, ""with the president and the vice president, Mike Pence, who, like, wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear: The vice president of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife,” she said, holding up a photo of her and her wife, Emma Portner. “He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in 'conversion therapy,' he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the [governor] of Indiana.""

Page pivoted back to Smollett, who she said she doesn’t know but sends all her love to, and make the obvious connected between his attack and the effect having anti-LGBTQ+ politicians in power has on the culture at large. ""If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're gonna kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street,” she said, clearly holding back tears.”

“I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet,” referencing her VICELAND show Gaycation, on which she traveled to countries around the world, investigating how they each treat LGBTQ+ people. “I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.""

The Juno and Inception actress, who is also openly gay (as Smollett is), declared (around the 7:00 minute mark) that she was “fired up” after two men assaulted the Empire star while reportedly shouting homophobic and racial slurs. The Chicago PD and FBI are jointly investigating the attack as a hate crime, and Page believes that leadership is ultimately responsible for what has transpired.

Page detailed how she’s endured an enormous amount of homophobia during her career and personal life. She calls this “unfortunate” and believes that the current administration’s policies contribute to the continued normalization of homophobia. Page then directly calls out VP Mike Pence for advocating for “conversion therapy” (to be more precise, he actually advocated for the use of federal funding to “provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior”) while he was Indiana governor. She grew tearful while continuing:

“Connect the dots, this is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you wanna cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f**king stop.”

In the days since the attack in Chicago, heated arguments have taken place with a certain amount of backlash also landing upon those public figures with a history of homophobic “jokes” and tweets. Those remarks, as well, are being viewed as contributing to the cultural normalization of homophobia, which could play a role in furthering hate-inspired attacks like the one upon Smollett.

The Chicago PD is asking anyone with information about the attack to call 312-717-8382 or report tips anonymously at cpdtip.com."

A tall, bear-like figure, tonight topped off with a baseball cap and star-shaped face paint in the style of the rock band KISS, he possesses a honeyed baritone and a searing honesty that refuses to mellow with age.

In truth, his 100-minute set at Leeds Academy starts a little slowly, with Grant and his band, who include former Siouxsie and the Banshees drummer Budgie, appearing to be finding their feet while working their way through a succession of AOR ballads that channel his inner Elton John – albeit the Rocket Man with added cuss words.

Grey Tickles, Black Pressure, Jesus Hates F*****s and Smug C*** all contain cutting lyrical phrases but none of them has quite the killer chorus of his best work. It takes a switch to wonky electronica in the song Metamorphosis, from his latest album Love Is Magic, for things to seem musically energised.

Grant tells of his horror at reading reports of a racist and homophobic attack on the American actor Jussie Smollett, eliciting a supportive response from the audience. After Pale Green Ghosts he thanks them for cheering him up.

Indeed it’s the songs from that second solo album that really stand out here. It Doesn’t Matter To Him and Black Belt take on a life of their own live, while Sensitive New Age Guy is preceded by a devastating monologue about an English teacher friend of his whose life descended into alcoholism, depression and ultimately suicide after he came out as a transvestite. “That’s the kind of song you’re going to get out of me,” Grant deadpans.

Glacier is astonishing, with Grant’s marvellous voice in full flow as he delivers heartfelt lines such as “Don’t listen to anyone/Get answers on your own/Even if it means that sometimes/You feel quite alone”."

THE BUZZ: The situation along California’s border sounds very different depending who’s talking.

— Gov. Gavin Newsom and other officials gathered in San Diego yesterday were focused on assisting asylum-seekers , both via a shelter approved by the Board of Supervisors this week and with Newsom’s proposed budget outlays of $20 million for an immigration rapid-response program and $5 million for “immigration-related emergencies.” In the latter case, that’s money that’s passed the Assembly Budget Committee and could get an Assembly floor vote as soon as Monday.

— Compassion for immigrants vied with disdain for D.C. as Newsom and lawmakers touted their efforts, casting California as an antidote to federal inaction on a humanitarian crisis. The governor himself came in for plenty of praise for his early efforts to survey the situation and propose money to help, with Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins saying, “we are here today because our federal government has failed us.” She added: “California will do better.”

— Gazing west from the White House, Donald Trump continued to blast Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s border recalcitrance while floating an ambitious architectural plan he summarized as take the “wall along California, let’s move it to Arizona, let’s move it to Texas.” And, he proclaimed, “they wanted the wall built in San Diego so badly and we built it” — a potential reference to refurbished fencing in Calexico (other barriers in the San Diego region were erected starting in the 1990 and subsequently fortified).

— Pelosi, meanwhile, remained steadfast in repudiating the president, notwithstanding Trump’s claim that Pelosi would be “begging for a wall” should the Tijuana barrier come down: “There’s not going to be any wall money in the legislation,” she told reporters.

CALIFORNIA AND THE CAPITOL CORRIDOR

PG&E PAY: We already knew the Pacific Gas & Electric’s lobbying activity soared as Sacramento debated wildfire costs and liabilities in the latter months of the 2018 session, vaulting to $7.7 million between April and September as the embattled utility poured $5.5 million into what it described as “grassroots and other advocacy related to state legislative proposals concerning improved wildfire preparedness and response.” Judge William Alsup alluded to that in telling PG&E’s lawyers yesterday that they “could go to Sacramento today and get a law passed.”

— The lobbying report covering 2018’s final months came out yesterday. The time period encompasses both the worst-in-California-history Camp Fire and the annual Maui junket the utility said it refrained from attending. PG&E spent $1.2 million, including $821,000 for “grassroots and other advocacy” around wildfire policies, to push its total for 2017-2018 above $11 million, the vast bulk of it last year. As for PG&E’s counterparts: SoCal Edison spent $706,000 and Sempra $266,000, some of it on wildfire-related lobbying; Sempra’s disclosures include buying meals for legislators in Hawaii.

TECH AGENDA: Final-quarter reports also reflect the centrality of two issues for tech industry groups and the wider business world: consumer privacy (after the Legislature enshrined broad new restrictions on the use of customer data) and worker classification (after a California Supreme Court ruling broadened the definition of employees). Privacy showed up as a lobbying subject for Facebook, Google, Lyft, Apple and umbrella groups like TechNet and the CTIA; efforts to influence policy around the Dynamex decision appears in reports from Lyft, Uber, TechNet and the California Business Roundtable.

LAW AND ORDER: “Can a new law reduce police shootings?

A collection of national ad industry groups yesterday wrote California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, whose office is responsible for enforcing new privacy protections, to argue “data-driven advertising supports and subsidizes the content and services consumers expect and rely on” and urge Becerra to clarify rules around selling information and consumer opt-outs.

And the talented high school player hopes to one day make history.

—Cory Booker announces presidential bid for 2020 election ‘Together, America, we will rise’—

With a scholarship offer on the table, Harris can potentially become one of the first women to play a non-kicker position on a college football roster, ESPN reported.

Harris is a rarity in the male-dominated field of football and plays free safety at East Los Angeles College in California. She recently received a scholarship offer from Bethany College to play football at the NAIA school.

If Harris accepts the offer, she will become the first female player to receive a scholarship offer for football.

“I’ve had this dream ever since I was younger,” Harris explains. “I do feel a lot more pumped now since I have the platform to show coaches that I have the talent and the potential to play at the next level, the collegiate level and the NFL level, so I’m ready.”

Harris is well-sought after and scholarship offers have poured in also from Adams State University, Graceland University and Kentucky Christian University, USA Today reports.

She plans to sign her intent letter his summer.

Toyota has hand-picked the football star to feature in a Super Bowl big game commercial, detailing her story.

“I was getting ready for a game, it was like a four-hour business trip … and I all of a sudden heard my phone beep,” Harris tells People Now. “I saw a message saying that Toyota wanted to interline my story with the Rav4 they were using for the Super Bowl this year and I was like ‘Wow! What!’”

Harris is still beside herself with excitement seeing her vision and story played out before millions.

“Little girls with dreams become women with visions. I am that little girl & that women. This is only the BEGINNING of everything I want,” she wrote on Instagram.

The commercial will air in the second quarter right before the two-minute warning, the outlet reports."

The 31-year old actress who married dancer Emma Portner last year appeared on “The Late Show” and blamed Pence for anti-LGBTQ hate and violence.

“Connect the dots,” she urged the audience, linking the Vice President’s staunch anti-LGBT agenda, including from when he was the governor of Indiana and a U.S. Congressman, to hate and violence.

“If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering,” Page charged.

“What do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you can meet. I am lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.”

Page was referring to her VICELAND show “Gaycation,” during which she traveled to several countries around the world and interviewed anti-LGBTQ extremists.

“Sorry, I’m really fired up tonight, but it feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married, let’s just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy,” Page told Colbert.

Page said Pence “has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana, and I think the thing we need to know, and I hope my show ‘Gaycation’ did this in terms of connecting the dots, in terms of what happened the other day to Jussie [Smollett], I don’t know him personally, I send all of my love, connect the dots.”

The letter received Jan. 22 at Cinespace Studios, where Empire is filmed, is being investigated by the FBI; Chicago police are working the Tuesday attack on the African-American actor, who identifies as gay, per CNN. Police have released an image of two figures walking in the time and area of the attack, per the Chicago Tribune. They're seen on New Street near Illinois Street between 1:30am and 1:45am. Smollett says he was around the corner 15 to 30 minutes later when two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs, doused him in a chemical that might've been bleach, and put a rope around his neck.

A dozen detectives combing through surveillance footage have also found video of Smollett, who says he was on the phone with his manager when he was attacked while returning to his apartment from a Subway restaurant. Police say that hasn't been verified because the men ""did not turn over cellphone records"" when asked. ""That being said, we have no reason to doubt the statements given."" Smollett is seen walking in the opposite direction of the two persons of interest, perhaps putting them on a course to meet, before arriving at his apartment with a white rope tied as a noose around his neck. ""We are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice"" for this ""racial and homophobic hate crime,"" Smollett's family said Thursday. ""I can tell you that it's horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" President Trump also said Thursday when asked about the incident, per Variety. (More on the case here.)

""His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Smollett, who came out as gay in 2015, told police that he had gone to get something to eat in the upscale Streeterville neighborhood about 2 a.m. Tuesday when two men yelling racist and homophobic slurs attacked him, injuring his face.

He said the attackers, described only as men in dark clothing and ski masks, doused him with a chemical and wrapped a rope around his neck, police said. A source familiar with the investigation told NBC News that the chemical was believed to be bleach.

In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett said one of the assailants yelled out, ""This is MAGA country,"" which his manager, who said he was on the phone with the actor, also confirmed to police.

Despite embracing and celebrating black history everlastingly, Black History Month always provides me with the chance to highlight certain aspects of our narrative and inspire my own place in the American dream, even at a time when it sometimes seems less a dream and more of a nightmare.

While this annual month-long appreciation has since expanded into a massive spectacle that includes documentaries, books, events, discussions, and celebrations, far too often the contributions of black LGBTQ people remain marginalized and demeaned in our daily existence.

Growing up, the explicit, positive portrayal of people of color were sparse. It wasn’t until characters such as Calvin Owens (Paul James/Greek), Jamal Lyon (Jussie Smollett/Empire) and Jeffrey Harrington (Gavin Houston/The Haves and the Have Nots) came into my personal picture that I was able to fully identify with someone else and feel like it was ok to be my authentic self.

Despite the extent of progress that has been made in terms of representation in the media at large, I believe there is still much work to be done. I can’t help but think how transformative it would’ve been to my overall journey of acceptance and self-love if there had been more positive narratives, characters and media highlighting important individuals of color. Consequently, I feel it’s my responsibility to empower others in a similar place by highlighting thriving examples, both past and present, of my double minority status.

From civil rights leader Bayard Rustin to author Langston Hughes to well-renowned inventor George Washington Carver, black queer people have enriched our nation and our lives immensely. Nonetheless, stories about queer communities of color revolve around HIV/AIDS and hate crimes, which the horrific attack on Jussie Smollet only underscores. These are important stories to tell, and in their frequency, and atrocity, they keep journalists busy. Even so, there are many narratives of this communities’ transformative contributions to our nation and our long road to freedom that might help prevent attacks in the future.

In celebration of Black History Month this year and the journey of black LGBTQ individuals throughout modern American history, check out my selection of 19 influential black icons from the past and present paving the way for future generations of gay black people like me.

1. Alvin Ailey

Choreographer Alvin Ailey revolutionized modern dance after forming the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater in New York in 1958. Ailey was known for his multi-racial company at a time when many talented black dancers were excluded from performances. In 1992, three years after his death, Ailey was inducted into the C.V. Whitney Hall of Fame at the National Museum of Dance.

2. Angela Davis

An American political activist, scholar, and author, Davis emerged as a prominent counterculture activist and radical in the ’60s as a leader of the Communist Party USA, and had close relations with the Black Panther Party through her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, although she was never a party member. Her interests included prisoner rights; she founded Critical Resistance, an organization working to abolish the prison-industrial complex.

3. Audre Lorde, 1934-1992

Caribbean American writer Audre Lorde was actively involved in the early queer culture of Greenwich Village. She was also an activist for civil rights and feminist movements. Her poetry focuses on the female experience, race, and sexuality.

4. Bayard Rustin, 1912-1987

While King spoke as the face of the civil rights movement, another man stood behind the scenes, an indispensable force within the movement. He was Bayard Rustin, a man whose life was shaped by the very prejudices the movement fought against, not only because of his race, but also because he was gay. Rustin would spend his life fighting for the rights of others, even while facing discrimination of his own.

5. DeRay Mckesson

Battling racism and police brutality, DeRay Mckesson has emerged as a key 21st-century civil rights activist and educator. His documentation of the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, following the unjust murder of Michael Brown in 2014 solidified his role as a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement.

6. Frank Ocean

It almost feels taboo to be gay in the hip-hop and R&B scene, so when Odd Future member Frank Ocean came out about his relationship with a man when he was 19, the world took notice. Despite his young age, Ocean quickly became the pop icon that so many desperately needed, giving hope to those who have feared living in the dark about their own sexual orientation.

7. James Baldwin, 1924 to 1987

If you’ve ever read The Fire Next Time or Giovanni’s Room, or any other work by this icon, you’ve most likely been struck by writer James Baldwin’s eloquently subversive portraits of being marginalized in America. A dedicated advocate, James spoke out frequently on civil rights and participated actively in efforts to foster equality. He hung around with one of the most inspiring friend groups possible, which included Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, Langston Hughes, Malcolm X, Medgar Evers, and Martin Luther King Jr.

8. Janet Mock

Janet Mock rose as an editor for People, and came out to the public as a transgender woman in 2011. Janet combines her roles as author and advocate to inspire dialogue. She has strengthened the network of trans girls and women by creating the hashtag #GirlsLikeUs and, earlier this month, published her first memoir, Redefining Realness.

9. Jussie Smollett

When you hear the name Jussie Smollett, you immediately think of Jamal Lyon, the character he plays on the hit show Empire, who instantly became a cultural icon as he portrayed an openly, black gay man in a way that has never been seen before on television. Because unlike most of the black, gay characters you saw on TV used in stereotypical ways or for mere comic relief, Jamal has depth, a strong moral compass, confidence and illustrates a strong sense of self that drives him forward as an artist and as a businessman. Smollett, who is also openly gay, has all those traits as well. More importantly, he is an activist who has a genuine desire to use his music and platform to change the world, tackling social issues that some no longer want to talk about. Having survived a horrific gay bashing, he’s expected to come back stronger than ever.

9. Keith Boykin

Keith Boykin was an editor of The Daily Voice and a White House aide to President Bill Clinton. After Clinton’s election, Boykin became a director of specialty media. He became the highest-ranking openly gay person in the Clinton White House and helped organize the nation’s first meeting between LGBTQ leaders and a U.S. President. Since his time in the White House, Boykin has written a number of books.

10. Keiynan Lonsdale

Keiynan Lonsdale has quickly made a name for himself as a result of his groundbreaking role as superhero Kid Flash on CW’s The Flash [and movie, Love, Simon]. Since coming out last year on Instagram, the 26-year-old actor has also been using the powers of his platform to inspire a new generation. Keiynan stated on his Instagram in 2017: “I hope we can all learn to embrace who we are & not judge people who aren’t exactly the same as us. The truth is we are all family, we’re all one. Just love.”

11. Laverne Cox

Laverne Cox is a transgender activist and actress, best known for her role on Netflix‘s Orange Is The New Black and her work with GLAAD. She remains one of the most prominent and outspoken transgender advocates in the entertainment industry.

12. Lee Daniels

Lee Daniels is an Academy Award-nominated producer, director, screenwriter and actor. At age 21, Daniels started a nurse-staffing agency, which he sold a year later. The sale made him a millionaire and allowed him to pursue his dream of working in the entertainment industry. In an interview with GLAAD: All Access, Daniels spoke about the importance of having LGBT content in his hit show Empire, saying “The goals for my show is to break down walls, break down the walls of hatred, towards my community – not just the African-American community, but the gay community.”

13. Marsha P. Johnson, 1945 to 1992

Marsha P. Johnson was a transgender rights activist and a kind of a queer saint. She was a loud and colorful personality who was popular in New York City’s art, transgender, and activist communities between the 1960s until the 90s. Marsha took part in Andy Warhol’s ‘ladies and gentlemen’ series of photographs and in the flamboyant theatrical troupe, Hot Peaches. She was one of the first people to fight back against the police at the Stonewall Inn in 1969, screaming for her civil rights. Marsha told the judge during a court case that the P. in her name stood for “Pay it No Mind,” which became her trademark. She along with Sylvia Rivera founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) in the early 70s and they were the mothers of STAR House, which was provided food, clothing, and housing to transgender and non-gender conforming youth in NYC, one of the first organizations to advocate and support this population.

14. Michael Sam

Michael Sam, an American football defensive end who made history when he came out ahead of the 2014 NFL draft, making him the first of our own to be drafted in any major American sport. After coming out as gay during an ESPN interview, Sam was drafted by the St. Louis Rams as the 249th of 256 players selected. In 2014, he was named one of GQ magazine’s Men of the Year, and was a finalist for Sports Illustrated’s Sportsman of the Year.

15. Reece King

Model Reece King came out as bisexual in a January 2018 Gay Times interview. He stated: :I think a lot more creative LGBTQ people have taken the limelight, especially on social media. We see them on mood boards at shoots for inspiration. If people just keep doing their thing unapologetically, it breaks down the barriers in more homophobic environments.”

16. RuPaul

RuPaul is one of Hollywood’s famous black gaylebrities, ushering in worldwide interest in all things drag with the incredible success of Drag Race, now on its 11th season.

17. Sheryl Swoopes

Three-time WNBA MVP, Sheryl Swoopes was the first player to be signed to the WNBA after its inception. Not only was she a star on the court, but she was one of the first high profile athletes to come out publicly and later voted one of the Top 15 players in WNBA history.

18. Wade Davis

Wade Davis is not your typical retired professional football player. The 40-year-old played in the NFL for three years, first as an undrafted free agent for the Tennessee Titans and later in the NFL’s Europe League. After short stints in training camps for the Seattle Seahawks and Washington, D.C.’s, NFL team, Davis retired in 2003 due to a leg injury. It wasn’t until 2012 that he publicly came out, and his world began to change. Now, Davis is an outspoken advocate. “The amount of privilege that being an NFL player gives you is in-fucking-measurable,” Davis said. He’s now the NFL’s first inclusion consultant, dealing with issues like racism, sexism and homophobia in sports. He’s also director of professional sports outreach for You Can Play, an organization that promotes equality. In addition, Davis is a UN Women Champion for Innovation, as part of their Global Innovation Coalition for Change, and regularly advises Google and other Fortune 500 companies on creating more inclusive work environments.

Chastising his colleagues, Schiff delivered a powerful four-minute takedown of the GOP’s defense of what he called the President’s and his team’s “immoral,” “unethical,” “unpatriotic,” and “corrupt” behavior.

“My colleagues might think it’s okay that the Russians offered dirt on the Democratic candidate for president as part of what’s described as the Russian government’s effort to help the Trump campaign,” Chairman Schiff began (video below, full transcript here.) “You might think that’s okay. My colleagues might think it’s okay that when that was offered to the son of the president, who had a pivotal role in the campaign, that the president’s son did not call the FBI, he did not adamantly refuse that foreign help — no, instead that son said he would ‘love’ the help with the Russians.”

Adam Schiff is my Congressman, so I have a bit more of a stake in this nonsense. The people who are demanding that he resign are not terribly intelligent. We should want more for America than a president who equates personal disloyalty with actual treason. pic.twitter.com/hUl24pYC1i — Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) March 28, 2019

Schiff repeated his “you might think” mantra about 20 times in four minutes, and it’s ignited an explosion of people on social media who agree that regardless of what Attorney General William Barr would like America to believe, Trump and his team have committed “immoral,” “unethical,” “unpatriotic,” and “corrupt” acts.

They’ve turned it into a very popular hashtag on Twitter.

There’s been a lot of viral online challenges around, but Bey and Jay wants their fans to go green and if they do commit to a vegan lifestyle, fans could win up to 30 years of free concert tickets, The Daily Mail reports.

—Jussie Smollett Noose Video: Police have footage of ‘Empire’ actor with rope around his neck after brutal attack—

Yes, you can see Bey perform well into her golden years for free if you get your greens in.

On Wednesday, Beyonce announced “The Greenprint Project Sweepstakes,” on Instagram, that promises free concert tickets to fans who start incorporating plant-based meals into their diet.

“What is your Greenprint?” Beyoncé captioned the post. “Click the link in my bio for a chance to win tickets to any JAY and/or my shows for life.”

So push the cookies and cakes aside, Bey suggested plant-based breakfasts and meatless Mondays ways to infuse the new vegan diet into your life.

Bey and Jay are likely referring to Marco Borges’ vegan cookbook, which is called The Greenprint: Plant-Based Diet, Best Body, Better World. The couple contributed to the book’s introduction to advocate for veganism.

“Having children has changed our lives more than anything else,” they wrote. “We used to think of health as a diet — some worked for us, some didn’t. Once we looked at health as the truth, instead of a diet, it became a mission for us to share that truth and lifestyle with as many people as possible.”

First, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants, then hours later there were two “persons of interest.” The latest information to come out was that the 36-year-old “refused” to give the cops his phone. All of these inconsistent reports have prompted some to say Smollett fabricated the attack.

A close source to Jussie is now speaking out to TMZ.

“The sources say cops ‘informally asked’ Jussie if he would surrender his phone … to verify he was talking to his manager on his cell when he was attacked,” TMZ reported. “We’re told he felt ‘uncomfortable’ doing that and declined, but he was never asked about phone records. A Chicago police official had said Jussie refused to turn over both the phone and records. We’re told Smollett has already said he will provide the records, and is in the process of gathering them.”

The Chicago Police Department has also reported two different descriptions of the suspects. TMZ wrote that Jussie never said the men were wearing MAGA hats, only that they screamed “MAGA country.”

As for the rope around his neck, TMZ also explained, “There are reports that Jussie had the rope around his neck long after the incident when he was being treated at the hospital. We’re told that is not the case. He did have the rope around his neck when cops arrived at his building 42 minutes after the incident. The sources say he kept it there to ‘preserve the evidence.'”

On Tuesday, while walking to a Subway in Chicago, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor after he exited a restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Rumors have been circulating online that it was a “hook up gone wrong” or Smollett just made up the story for attention. Threatening letters directed at Smollett were reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago last week. The cutout letters said, “You will die black f**.” See below:

Hopefully, the Chicago Police Department can stop leaking news to the press and focus on their investigation.

""It would be nice to have the yin and the yang there... but you know, you need proper preparation time — and I mean, Kevin would've hosted it this year if they weren't tripping off of things that he said in his past that he already apologized for,"" she said.

Haddish then quickly shifted the focus to herself.

""I say a lot of things and I don’t apologize because I think before I speak, if I say it, I mean it,"" she said. ""Nobody’s perfect. From my mistakes I have become a success and I learn not to make them again.""

Hart first apologized when he stepped down as host in December.

""I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year's Oscar's... this is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists,"" Hart wrote on Twitter, before uttering words he had refused to say just hours before. ""I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past.""

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn’t spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett’s family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked “racial and homophobic hate crime” and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

They thanked the public “for their prayers” and said the family is “so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.”

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said. “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

They said such incidents will continue to happen until people are held accountable.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama “Empire” is shot in Chicago and follows an African-American family navigating the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Smollett has told police that he was walking home from a Subway restaurant when the attack occurred. Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of his walk home, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neckbefore fleeing. Smollett’s manager called police about 40 minutes after Smollett got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven’t seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett’s description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels. Smollett was walking in an area that has high-end hotels and restaurants. It also has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett’s walk home, Guglielmi said.

It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn’t far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned."

A vigilant neighbor who filmed the moments after Botham Jean was shot by a Dallas police officer who barged into his apartment, says she has been receiving death threats ever since she posted the video.

—Dallas cop who fatally shot Botham Jean makes a court appearance; sticks to gag order—

The woman who asked to be identified as “Bunny” spoke to Advise Media Network about the turmoil she’s endured ever since she captured the aftermath of the September 6 incident after Jean was fatally killed by 30-year-old police officer Amber Guyger.

Bunny explains that she overhead two shots and a man’s voice shouting asking why he had been shot. She then rushed outside and started filming within a minute after she heard the initial shots.

In the video, Guyger is pacing the floor of the balcony looking anxious and frantic as she made an urgent 911 call. Bunny however, said the call seemed more like a personal call than a 911 report, The Daily Mail reports.

“It was just a lot of crying, a lot of hysterics,” Bunny said. “She was just pacing back-and-forth for at least seven minutes, according to my video.”

Guyger told investigators that she had just ended a 15-hour shift when she returned in uniform to the South Side Flats apartment complex. She parked on the fourth floor, instead of the third, where she lived, according to the affidavit, possibly suggesting that she was confused or disoriented.

—Jussie Smollett Noose Video: Police have footage of ‘Empire’ actor with rope around his neck after brutal attack—

When she put her key in the apartment door, of Jean a Black St. Lucia native, which was unlocked and slightly ajar, it opened, the affidavit said. Inside, the lights were off, and she saw a figure in the darkness that cast a large silhouette across the room, according to the officer’s account.

Bunny cast doubt on Guyger’s account and said she doesn’t believe the cop mistook the fourth floor, where Jean lived, for the third floor.

Bunny cites the floor markers and signs and doesn’t believe Guyger could have missed them. She also said the apartment’s fire doors, which swing shut automatically, could have been propped open.

The witness said she posted the video to give credence to what she witnessed happened since she didn’t believe it matched up with Guyger’s story of events.

Her due diligence however, resulted in being harassed by investigators she said.

And backlash online was swift.

“I did get a few threats from people saying they weren’t gonna leave any witnesses behind, telling me I need to watch my back, things like that,” she said.

Then Bunny because a victim of circumstance and random people called her job, a pharmaceutical company, and falsely reported that she was a ‘radical,’ ‘anti-police’ and ‘a black extremist.’ They ultimately fired her since they didn’t want to be involved, Bunny claims.

Guyger recently made a court appearance this week.

Flanked by her attorneys, Guyger, appeared at the Dallas Criminal Courthouse but State District Judge Tammy Kemp did not conduct a hearing in the courtroom for Guyger’s ‘announcement’ setting. No word on what attorneys discussed during the appearance, The Dallas Morning News reported. Neither Guyger or her attorneys commented as they left the hearing, obeying a judge’s order not to publicly discuss the case."

The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love I have with my wife,” Page said as host Stephen Colbert showed a picture of her and her wife.

If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?”

Page said it will lead to LGBT kids getting abused, commit suicide, and getting attacked on the streets.

“This needs to f**king stop,” she concluded.

The attack Smollett, which he reported as being attacked by two men in masks, beaten, had a rope tied around his neck, and doused with bleach at 2:00 A.M. in Chicago, is still under investigation by police.

The Chicago police so far only have video footage of two people who were walking nearby at the time of the incident. No video of the attack has been found, according to the Chicago Tribune.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed that in the early hours of January 29, Smollett was beaten by two males who approached him while yelling ""racial and homophobic slurs"" at around 2 a.m. Tuesday morning in the 300 block of E. North Water Street.

Having returned to Chicago on a delayed flight from New York City, Smollett was assaulted by the two men, who proceeded to pour ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a rope around Smollett's neck before fleeing the scene. After reporting the assault to the police and sitting for an interview, Smollett drove to Northwestern Hospital for medical treatment. Under increased security, he returned to his home late Tuesday and is reported to be in good condition.

On Wednesday, police released images from a surveillance camera of potential persons of interest who are wanted in questioning in regards to the attack on Smollett and set up a community alert:

Here is the full statement from Smollett's family:

""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.""

But the ostensible purpose of her visit was barely mentioned; instead, Page used Colbert's questions about climate change and Hollywood's treatment of the LGBTQ community to get real. ""We need to be talking about [the impact of climate change] on the most marginalized people,"" Page told Colbert. ""It's really serious. We've been told that by 2030 the world as we know it, that's it. That's it.""

As Colbert held up a photo of Page and her wife Emma Portner, Page cited the recent hate crime beating of Empire actor Jussie Smollett, and called out President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for promoting a homophobic, anti-gay agenda. ""Connect the dots,"" Page said. ""This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering for them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten in the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you can meet. I am lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this: This needs to fucking stop.""

Since coming out in 2014, Page has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights and climate justice. Her documentary show Gaycation took viewers around the world to explore how LGBTQ communities face hatred and adversity in hostile cultures.

A ""solidarity rally for Jussie Smollett"" is planned for tonight (Friday) at Grand Army Plaza in Manhattan (corner of 59th Street and 5th Avenue) starting at 5 p.m. Details here."

Maxine Waters Wants Full Equality for LGBTQ+ Folks

Tuesday night, the people’s auntie, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, hosted her second annual State of the Union Millennial Media Row and invited some of her favorite outlets including yours truly! The outspoken political figure has made a point to not back down at any moment from the rhetoric of the President. Last year’s event coincided with her own speech that rebuffed President Trump’s annual address. This year, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi postponed the speech to next week, Waters decided to stage her event regardless.

“To my utter surprise and delight I have been adopted by the millennial community, which has affectionately named me ‘Auntie Maxine’, and I have gained an understanding of the valuable ways in which these young people are using social media and the internet to voice their concerns about public policy, our government, and world events,” she said prior to the event. “To that end, I am committed to being an enabler and a catalyst for millennials, ensuring that they have access to other elected officials and the legislative process, and that they also have an opportunity to be at the table to advise and develop public policy in the federal, state, and local government.”

Check out the video from our IG Live and a transcript of her words below.

We are here with the woman of the night, the woman of every night, Congresswoman Maxine Waters. It’s so amazing to be talking with the Gentlelady from California. So I actually just moved from Oakland not too long ago, so this is kismet.

Well, you know Kamala Harris had a great event in Oakland yesterday or was it Sunday? [It had] over 200,000 people in attendance.

Which is phenomenal. And what has it been like for you to be such a fierce voice for so many underserved and marginalized folks in our country?

I feel that it is my responsibility to use the opportunity that has been given to me by people who voted for me and sent me here to speak truth to power. It’s absolutely a responsibility to see to it that issues that don’t get talked about get elevated here in the Congress of the United States. And, of course, it has been my responsibility and my deep passion to talk about what is wrong with the White House and why this President should not be there.

Absolutely. What’s been on a lot of people’s hearts in the LGBTQ+ community recently has been obviously the trans military ban. What are some ways we can resist that and some ways that we can stay empowered in this moment?

Well, look. One of the things we have to do is we have to confront these issues head-on. Whether we’re talking about the ban that’s been put on in the military or whether we’re talking about full equality for those people who have chosen to have different lifestyles, who are gay, who are transgender, whatever. They have a right to live a decent quality of life not interfered with by others who think they know better than them about who they are or what they stand for and what they feel and who they love. And so, we’ve got to confront it. We have legislation circulated on equality and so we’ve got to legislate, we’ve got to fight for it, we’ve got to stand up for it. And just like Jussie Smollett, who was attacked in Chicago, we have speak up about that and we’ve got to find the people who did that. We can not let that go without making sure we bring those people to justice.

And it’s all connected. Talking about what happened to our brother Jussie and really the white supremacy that was behind that attack has been bolstered by this President, right? And so, with this ‘Wall’ and this shutdown, what have been your thoughts on how this presidency has rolled out?

Well, first of all, I think that the President does not deserve to be the President of the United States. I think that it has been documented that he has lied over 6,000 times. I think he has a history of having cheated folks in the Trump University, where he was forced to have to pay back $25 million. We know, in addition to that, he and his father denied African Americans access to rental property.

And he’s defined himself quite well since he’s been in this office. He’s talked about countries of color as “shithole countries.” He has talked about the NFL and called them “SOBs.” So we know who he is. He certainly, in my estimation, qualifies for impeachment. There are those who think, “Oh, you have to wait for [Robert] Mueller, the special counsel, until he comes with the information.” Well, we don’t know how that report is going to be given to us — whether it’s redacted so much that you can’t really understand it or whether it’s going to get to the public at all or just be confined to members of Congress and it’s classified. So we’ve got to work for what we believe in. If we want to support what we think is a democracy, we’ve got to make sure it works for everybody. This President is divisive, intimidating, threatening, and we can not allow the leader of the free world to lead in that fashion.

So we can try and end on a higher note. What is the advice that you have for folks who are trying to find their political voice? You’ve had a career where you’ve spoken out about these things long before this moment, right? You were speaking out about everything back in the ‘90s and even before that. So what advice do you have for young people, people of all ages who are trying to find their political voice?

Let me just say this. I commend young people and the Millennials who have raised the level of discussion about what’s wrong with this country that young people can’t rent property, can’t buy a home, can’t have the quality of life that they thought they were going to have when they went to college. We’re here today where we recognize that Millennials have power, they have influence. They are podcasting and broadcasting in ways that we never really realized before. And for all of those people who are sitting there waiting on real discussion from CNN, CBS, and ABC, there’s an alternative to that now. And I’m so glad that Millennials do have a growing voice in the political arena and have influence and people are paying attention. And because of that we are going to have some changes."

She predicted the world was going to end in the next eleven years, yet no one was talking about it, and emotionally ripped into the Vice President for causing the alleged anti-gay attack against Smollett.

Host Stephen Colbert commiserated with Page over the effects of global warming, wondering how they could “get the public and the media to pay more attention to what’s happening.” He added, “There’s such a long time span,” that people didn’t feel it was an immediate threat. The actress disagreed, echoing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that the world was going to end very soon...as in the next eleven years.

“Is it that long?” Page said skeptically. Colbert argued that “until the water started swamping Manhattan, or just washes away Mar-a-Lago,” the public and media wouldn’t take it seriously. “You don’t want to think such terrible things are going to happen!” he gushed.

The actress blamed “environmental racism” saying that “people of color” do nothing to cause global warming but are disproportionately affected by it. “This is happening and it’s happening to the most marginalized people and we need to be talking about it!” she urged. If that wasn’t loony enough, Page then predicted the date the world was going to end:

“It's really serious. We’ve been told, that as we know it, by 2030, the world as we know it, that's it. That's it. That's it!”she gushed.

Alluding to recent sci-fi movies, Page went on to hope that actress Amy Adams would “save us” and “the aliens would finally come and have compassion on us.” She scolded the media for not taking it as seriously as she did, weirdly shifting suddenly to hate crimes. Sounding like Chuck Todd, she demanded there not be any “debate” about either of these things:



“The urgency would be so severe. But instead, we have a media that’s barely talking about it. We have a media that says it's a debate that whether or not what happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. Its absurd. Its not a f***ing debate,” she ranted, as Colbert agreed. Meanwhile, the host sat silently and let his Canadian guest emotionally tear into Mike Pence for that alleged attack, warning people to ""connect the dots:"""

After Cardi B went viral for her rant about the government shutdown, some Democrats were apparently looking to her for political leadership. The Bronx rapper has actually been asked to speak at a Democratic event in Polk County, Iowa.

Polk County Democrats tweeted, “As the center of the IA Caucuses, we have been honored to host @ TeamPelosi, @ CecileRichards, @ KamalaHarris, @ SenGillibrand, @ PramilaJayapal, @ Grace4NY, and many powerful women leaders.”

The tweet continued, “It only makes sense to invite @ iamcardib to a reception of her choice while she’s here in May.”

As the center of the IA Caucuses, we have been honored to host @TeamPelosi, @CecileRichards, @KamalaHarris, @SenGillibrand, @PramilaJayapal, @Grace4NY, and many powerful women leaders. It only makes sense to invite @iamcardib to a reception of her choice while she’s here in May. — Polk Co. Democrats (@polkdems) January 29, 2019

Cardi responded with, “Should I?”

Polk County’s Democratic organization “is the biggest in Iowa, a state that is traditionally an early stop for White House hopefuls,” NBC News reported.

The Iowa Democrats might want to be careful before jumping on the Cardi B bandwagon. At the end of December, she was being slammed for reportedly agreeing to perform at the Super Bowl, which earned her tons of backlash considering she said in the past she was supportive of Colin Kaepernick.

According to Page Six, the rapper was in negations but she was asking for a fee up to $1 million. Performers are paid for the Super Bowl but they do receive a “gift in kind.” Allegedly, she also wanted a solo spot in the show. A close source told the outlet, “Cardi B is standing tough and holding out. She doesn’t want to do it unless they roll out the red carpet for her.”

However, Cardi’s team responded to Page Six, saying, “The rumor circulating that she wants a million dollars and she wants her own set is false. There was never a firm offer to begin with for a performance. There [were] talks about it, but she was not particularly interested in participating because of how she feels about Colin Kaepernick and the whole movement.” The statement continued, “But again, there was never a solid offer for her to say yes or no to regarding the Super Bowl. She is already confirmed to do a set with Bruno Mars that weekend.”

That said, Cardi B and Meek Mill will be performing at a Super Bowl party in Atlanta the night before the game. Reportedly, she will also be featured in a Super Bowl ad.

Iowa Democrats don’t need Cardi, they need to focus on beating Trump.

Pence has historically fought the legalization of gay marriage, and is accused of advocating for gay conversion therapy, and it was there that Page began her impassioned plea for change.

“The Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife,” Page said. “He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy.” The audience obviously agreed with Page as there was prolonged booing following this statement.

Page then went on to blame Pence for the recent attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett, who was the victim of a suspected racist and homophobic assault early Tuesday morning in Chicago.

“He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana,” Page said, “and I think the thing we need to know, and I hope my show Gaycation did this in terms of connecting the dots, in terms of what happened the other day to Jussie, I don’t know him personally, I send all of my love, connect the dots.”

Page has sparred with politicians in the past over their anti-LGBTQ policies. She confronted then presidential candidate Ted Cruz at the 2015 Iowa State Fair, and she put the onus on all politicians with such policies for attacks like the one on Smollett.

“If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is gonna happen?” Page asked. “Kids are gonna be abused and they’re gonna kill themselves. And people are gonna be beaten on the street.”

And finally, Page didn’t mince words when she called for an end to anti-LGBTQ sentiment in government.

“I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet,” Page said. “I am lucky to have the time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f**kin’ stop.”

The Fox News host focused on the triggering effect the red hats with President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, have on people during Thursday’s “The Angle” broadcast.

Airing multiple clips from other networks, Ingraham contended that “the goal” of Democrats and the liberal media is “to brand an entire belief system as immoral, evil, toxic, and of course it’s racist.”

“I remember when liberals loved to debate, they now prefer the easier route: Just call someone a Nazi or a closet KKK member, and you’re done,” Ingraham said, noting how they failed using this approach during the contentious confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

“The examples appear almost daily,” Ingraham continued, citing several recent news stories including the disastrous coverage of the Covington Catholic school students wearing MAGA hats and the alleged attack on actor Jussie Smollett, who claims his attackers yelled “this is MAGA country” as he was beaten by the assailants who poured an unknown liquid on him and hurled racist and homophobic insults at him.

“It is also hurtful to the country when partisans rush in to create political scapegoats for every individual crime or infraction,” Ingraham said.

She slammed the “destructive racial narrative” which has “infected our political life,” arguing that Democrats just “resort to using a shame, guilt, and grievance to get their political way, which basically ends up accomplishing nothing.”

“And it ends up helping no one. Except those whose pockets are lined by peddling victimhood,” she added.

Ingraham went on to note that “by any objective analysis, Donald Trump’s policies are working. And they’re not scary, and they’e not racist, and they’re not anti-woman, and they’re not anti-immigrant.”

“Not only is this conservative agenda working,” she pointed out, “it’s working really well for minorities.”

Republicans should “actively engage in minority communities” and not “be bullied out of them,” Ingraham argued, saying the resistance just wants people to be “angry and resentful” while ignoring Trump’s successes.

“As for those red hats? Well I would continue to wear them whenever and wherever you like,” Ingraham concluded. “And when doing so, be sure to show everyone around you what true tolerance, kindness, and inclusiveness looks like.”

—REPORTS: Police spot persons of interest in Jussie Smollett attack on surveillance video—

Police Officer Jennifer Bryk told The NY Daily News that Smollett was seen on camera walking into a residential building, but no other persons appear on video, she explained.

In addition to the FBI, there are reportedly at least a dozen officers working on the case and most of Smollett’s moves the night of the vicious attack, have been tracked, officer Michael Carroll said earlier Thursday.

Footage of the actual attack has not been found as of yet.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told NBC News that Smollett said he was speaking to his manager during the attack that occurred in the wee hours Tuesday morning, but declines to share his telephone records.

Smollett told police he had just left a Subway when two men in dark clothes approached and yelled the slurs. Smollett told police he was hit and a chemical — maybe bleach — was poured on him. They put a rope around his neck and yelled, “This is MAGA country,’’ he told detectives.

Guglielmi said footage from the apartment building is sharp and shows Smollett walking in with a white rope around his neck. “We can confirm that, yeah, it was a rope, tied as a noose. It was tied that way,’’ he said. “You can tell it’s a rope tied as a noose.’’

As two persons of interests are sought, Smollett’s family released a joint statement exclusively to theGrio, putting to rest rumors that Smollett wasn’t being forthcoming in the investigation.

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.

With Love & Gratitude,

The Smollett Family

Smollett has received an outpouring of support across social media from celebrities and fans alike.

Taraji P. Henson, who plays Smollett’s character’s mother on the show, tweeted: “I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now. @jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone.”

On Thursday afternoon, when asked about the Smollett attack in the White House, Trump said it was “horrible” and “Doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

Illinois Congressman Bobby Rush has called on the FBI to investigate the attack as a hate crime.

Jurnee Smollett Bell has stepped forward to address her brother’s horrific Chicago attack.

Last night, Jurnee went to Instagram to discuss the possible hate crime aftermath and released a family statement.

Jussie is currently slated for a scheduled weekend performance and expected to address the Chi-Town assault.

Jussie has a concert Saturday night at the legendary Troubadour, and we’re told the show will go on. Tickets for the venue — which has a capacity of 400 — were available Tuesday, but with all the hubbub it’s now sold out. The tickets were going for $20-$35 a pop, but they’re being resold for 70 bucks and more. We’re told Jussie, who still bears scars and swelling, will almost certainly make reference to homophobia, racism and MAGA. (TMZ)

During a Thursday press conference, President Donald Trump called the assault nothing less than horrible.

On Thursday, the President of the United States was asked about the homophobic, racist attack against Smollett by a reporter in the Oval Office. “That, I can tell you, is horrible,” Trump said. “I’ve seen it, last night. I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned.” (E! News)

Coincidentally, Smollett’s attack came from alleged Make America Great Again supporters."

At the time of the attack, Jussie was speaking on the phone with his manager. It was reported that Smollett was refusing to turn over his phone records to police.

According to TMZ, that is not the case. He was “informally asked” Jussie if he would surrender his phone … to verify he was talking to his manager on his cell when he was attacked.

Smollett was apparently “uncomfortable” doing that and declined, but he was never asked about phone records.

Another error in reporting has been that the two assailants were wearing MAGA hats. That is not the case, they screamed “MAGA country.”

Reports also indicated that the Empire actor had the rope around his neck long after the incident when he was being treated at the hospital. That is not true as well.

He did keep the rope around his neck until the police arrived at his friend’s apartment, 42 minutes after the incident occurred. He kept the rope on so that he could “preserve the evidence.”

TMZ has also reported that a woman, who lives in Smollett’s apartment building, allegedly told police of a man “loitering” outside the building’s entrance before the attack.

The woman told TMZ that she had gone out to walk her dogs when she saw the man whom she said “looked out of place” and was hanging around the building by its entrance and the parking garage.

She then described the man in detail to the outlet, including all the clothing he was wearing. She then stated she saw what “looked like a rope or a clothesline” coming out of his sweatshirt.

The woman also noted there was another man in the area as well.

(Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty)

The two stories broke within an hour of each other: First, Bruce McArthur, the Toronto serial killer who killed eight men with links to the city’s gay village, pleaded guilty to his heinous crimes. Then came the news that Jussie Smollett—the star of Fox’s Empire—had been attacked in what police are investigating as a hate crime.

The details of the attack on Smollett are chilling. Racist and homophobic epithets were allegedly hurled at the actor. He had bleach poured on his face. And, evoking the horrors of America’s historic treatment of black people, a rope was wrapped around his neck—essentially a noose.

These two stories are separate but they reflect a stark reality for non-white people in the LGBT+ community: Being out can be a matter of life and death for us.

The images of white gay couples celebrating marriage equality, or white gay people marching jubilantly at Pride parades, might make it seem like equality has been achieved. But far from it. True equality is a long way off when gay people of colour continue to be ostracised within their communities, and are attacked by others for the colour of their skin.

What must Smollett have been thinking and feeling in the early hours of Tuesday morning when his (reportedly white) assailants denigrated him between blows, asking him if he was that “faggot Empire n***er?” Both these words, through their bitter history, are used to dehumanise their recipient, to have the equivalent effect of a dagger through the heart. Combined in the same moment of hatred, how small must Smollett have been made to feel? Stripped of his fame, philanthropic achievements and acting accolades all in one moment.

“I shudder to think that a man could tell that I was insecure or an ‘outsider’ and prey on that.”

I’ve been called a “black c**t” and I can tell you that that I have shrivelled into myself. In one moment, I have felt ripped of all my personality, my validity as a contributing member of society, and judged solely because of the colour of my skin.

In the McArthur case, it’s telling that the majority of his victims had brown skin and ethnic-sounding names, like me. Seven of the eight victims had ties to Toronto’s gay village, home of its LGBT+ community. Some had emigrated to Canada from their homelands—perhaps to get away from intolerant views on homosexuality that still prevail in countries in South Asia.

Many of my South Asian relatives consider homosexuality to be an abomination—an aberration from god’s design—and, so, much of my life has been spent sitting silently as they shouted at a gay kiss on television, or casually dropped the “faggot” bomb when the opposing team scored a goal.

A friend of McArthur’s first known victim Skandaraj Navaratnam, who disappeared in 2010, said Navaratnam “came [to Canada] from so much heartache in Sri Lanka.” Karen Fraser, on whose property landscaper McArthur disposed of the dismembered bodies of his victims, recalls meeting at least two of them. She described one as being “very lost, obviously not adapting to Canada very quickly.”

“I’ve been called a “black c**t” and I can tell you that that I have shrivelled into myself.”

McArthur, it seems, targeted men marginalised in an already marginalised community. Men whose disappearances, perhaps, the police wouldn’t expend their resources investigating—after all, brown and black people are usually the villains in the police narrative. Eight men disappeared between 2010 and 2017, but McArthur was not arrested until last year.

For a brown person like me, that is chilling.

That could have been me. I, too, ventured out of the confines of my own community and visited gay spaces, sometimes with friends, sometimes alone, trying to find a place that I belonged. I shudder to think that a man could tell that I was insecure or an ‘outsider’ and prey on that. And if I were to go missing, would the police care?

A minority within a minority is a scary place to be."

Releasing the two images, Chicago police said surveillance video of the attack has not yet been found, but that more cameras are being reviewed.

The suspects are reported to have shouted “racial and homophobic slurs” and Jussie says they referenced MAGA – the slogan Make America Great Again.

Jussie Smollett’s family have said the attack on the black and gay Empire actor in downtown Chicago this week was a “hate crime”.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn’t spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home.

Smollett’s family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked “racial and homophobic hate crime” and that he has been forthright with the police.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 am Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Donald Trump expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels."

The Empire actor, who plays gay singer Jamal Lyon, was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago earlier this week, leaving him with a series of injuries.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” he added.

The actor ended his statement by saying: “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Before Smollett released his statement, his family labelled the attack as “racist, homophobic and domestic terrorism”.

The Sun reported his family pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

It reads: “This was a racial, homophobic hate crime … We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings.”

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

""The Umbrella Academy"" star got emotional while talking about the recent attack on Jussie Smollett, and how leaders like Trump and Pence empower hatred.

Ellen Page gave an incredibly powerful and impassioned speech about the state of hate in the world and how it's reached this level thanks to powerful men like Trump and Pence on ""The Late Show.""

The star of Netflix's ""The Umbrella Academy"" got emotional herself as she spoke about the recent attack on Jussie Smollett, the seeming unwillingness of the media to be direct about things like hate crimes and even climate change. She railed against people in power who seek to cause the suffering of others as the catalyst for this kind of violence.

Throughout it, Colbert mostly just sat back and let her speak. At one point, she apologized for being ""really fired up tonight,"" but Colbert assured her there was nothing to apologize for.

""It feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the president and the vice president, Mike Pence, who wishes I coudn't be married,"" she said. ""Let's just be clear, the vice president of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.""

Page made her way to the topic of Jussie Smollett by discussing what she sees as the refusal of people in power and even the media to just accept climate change for what it is, and who inordinately marginalized people and people of color have suffered even in that arena.

""We have a media that's saying it's a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime,"" she said. ""Its absurd. This s--t isn't a debate.""

She also doesn't think it's a mystery why that crime happened today. ""Connect the dots. This is what happens,"" she said. ""If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?

""Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street.""

She acknowledged her platform and privilege, which is why she was taking this opportunity to speak out. ""I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you can meet,"" she told Colbert. ""I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f-----g stop.""

Page also spoke about her experiences coming up in Hollywood where she claims to have experienced plenty of misogyny and homophobia, but she sees it as systemic to an industry that is so ""narrow in it's ideas of who can tell stories and who can be in the stories.""

While she did acknowledge that there has been change in recent years, she is urging Hollywood to pick up the pace. ""there is some progress, there is some more representation but honestly, I really think we need to hurry up,"" she said. ""It's not cutting it.""

The entire discussion, which was more like an impassioned, well-informed and personally meaningful monologue, is worth checking out. Page feels what she's trying to express so viscerally that it is an emotional experience for both her and those who witnessed it.

Colbert's studio audience gave her a sustained standing ovation. You can check it out for yourself in the video above.

According to a January 31 report from Entertainment Tonight, Empire actor Jussie is staying strong and will soon be heading back to work following the incident. He could potentially be back in the public eye as early as February 2 after being released from the hospital.

According to an Empire source who spoke out to the outlet, Jussie will be returning to the show in his role of Jamal Lyon once filming resumes.

“As of now, Jussie plans to return to work when filming for his role picks up again,” the insider revealed, shortly after the Inquisitr reported that filming for the Fox series was temporarily shut down due to the freezing temperatures currently gripping Chicago, where the show is filmed.

They added that the halt on filming due to inclement weather has allowed Smollett to take a little “time to process everything that happened” to him.

But while it could be a few more days until work on the show picks back up on the drama, Jussie could actually be back in the spotlight a little sooner than that after being hospitalized following the brutal attack.

ET reported that the Empire star currently has no plans to cancel his scheduled appearance at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on February 2 after the insider described him as being so “strong.”

“Jussie is planning to perform a musical show this weekend in L.A.,” the source said. “He knows that what happened to him is unfortunate, but he’s not going to let it get the best of him.”

The source then added that Smollett is “a fighter” and won’t be slowing down his busy schedule.

“[He] will push through this, like everything else he has fought through in his life.”

As confirmed by CNN, the talented Empire actor was attacked by two people in Chicago on January 29, who allegedly shouted both homophobic and racial slurs at him. Police also claimed that the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck and even poured a chemical substance on him, which resulted in the actor being hospitalized for his injuries.

The Guardian described the horrific incident as a “MAGA hate crime” and claimed that the attackers allegedly told him “This is MAGA country” as they abused him.

As the Inquisitr shared, a number of celebrities have condemned the attack against Smollett, sharing messages of support for the actor across social media. Some of the huge names to speak out in support include John Legend, Ariana Grande, and several of the star’s Empire castmates, including his on-screen parents, Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson."

Before Smollett released his statement, his family labelled the attack as “racist, homophobic and domestic terrorism”.

The Sun reported his family pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

It reads: “This was a racial, homophobic hate crime … We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings.”

They continued: “These are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2am on Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven’t seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett’s description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

White House optimistic after China trade talks

Donald Trump has said he will soon meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, confident that they can reach “the biggest deal ever made” to end the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Trump welcomed China’s vice-premier, Liu He, to the White House on Thursday, after two days of talks in Washington, after which China’s trade delegation said they had “clarified a timetable and roadmap” for further negotiations.

Border wall. The president’s negotiations with Democrats are going less well, he said in an interview with the New York Times, implying he is still prepared to declare a national emergency to fund a wall at the southern border.

The leftwing former mayor of San Salvador, Nayib Bukele, is the favourite to win Sunday’s presidential election in El Salvador, after standing on an anti-graft platform following a string of government corruption scandals. Should the 37-year-old win this weekend, he will join a wave of anti-corruption candidates sweeping to power across Latin America, from both right and left, which began with the popular uprising that unseated the president of neighbouring Guatemala in 2015.

The FBI opened an investigation that cast a California civil rights group as “extremists”, and members of the Ku Klux Klan as victims, after a clash between the two at a white supremacist rally in Sacramento in 2016, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. Federal authorities began surveilling By Any Means Necessary after one of the leftist group’s members was stabbed at the rally.

Rebecca Solnit argues that Trump’s lurid, largely baseless warnings about the threat at the southern border are a distraction from the real dangers within – not least rightwing extremist violence, perpetrated by white men.

During an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the Juno actress gave a passionate speech criticising President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their consistent attacks on minorities.

“I am really fired up tonight, it feels impossible not to feel this way right now, with the president and Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married,” she said.

“Let’s just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the Governor of Indiana.”

Ellen then made reference to the recent attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who was beaten and had a noose tied around his neck in a suspected homophobic and racist attack.

“Connect the dots. This is what happens,” she continued.

“If you are in a position of power, and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go though your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?

“Kids are gonna be abused, and they’re gonna kill themselves, and people are gonna be beaten on the streets.

“I have travelled the world and I have met the most marginalised people you could meet. I am lucky to have the time and the privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.”

On Thursday’s Late Show to promote her new Netflix series The Umbrella Academy, an adaptation of Gerard Way and Gabriel Bá’s Dark Horse Comics series about a family of grown-up child superheroes, Ellen Page, instead, used her network airtime to fight some real-world evils. The actress and noted environmental and LGBTQ activist picked up on Stephen Colbert’s questions about her one-year anniversary with her wife, the dancer and choreographer Emma Portner, to deliver a blistering rebuke to those in positions of power—naming, naturally Donald Trump and Mike Pence—whose entire mission in life has been, according to Page, “to want to cause suffering.”



Segueing from a discussion of global warming—and the media’s coddling of those with a vested interest in still calling the end of “life as we know it” a debate—the Inception star laid into Pence by name as someone whose lifelong hatred of, and campaign against, gay people has caused untold but all-too-observable harm. Noting that the same news outlets and pundits that kowtow to the “debate” over global warming are also waffling over whether or not to call the racist, homophobic attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett on Tuesday a hate crime, Page had Colbert’s in-studio audience silently spellbound as she stated, passionately:

If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them—you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you can meet. I am lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.

Page, indeed, has used her considerable celebrity to travel the world, for her show Gaycation, to examine the ways in which marginalized LGBTQ people are impacted by hateful bigots in positions of power. (She sat down with Brazilian politician—and now president—Jair Bolsonaro to confront one such powerful bigot about comments about “beating the gay out of” children, for example.) And, while she apologized to Colbert for being “really fired up tonight,” Colbert gave the fired- up Page plenty of space to lay out Mike Pence’s long history as Indiana governor of supporting “gay conversion” therapy, and trying to ban gay marriage. With Colbert deftly holding up the picture of Page and Portner that he had shown earlier in the interview for emphasis, Page explained how the v ice p resident of the United States “wishes I couldn’t be married.” “Connect the dots,” Page urged Colbert’s viewers, once more pointing out how hateful rhetoric from the top actually winds up hurting people—sometimes on the streets of Chicago."

The 31-year-old actress appeared on Thursday’s “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” where she was very candid and passionate when talking about the current state of the world, America’s leadership, the showbusiness industry, and the recent racist and homophobic attack on actor Jussie Smollett.

Page didn’t hold back when discussing the tough topics, getting upset to the point of tears multiple times throughout her nine-minute interview.

She began by talking about her experience as a young actress growing up in the industry.

“In terms of the level of misogyny and homophobia I’ve dealt with, it’s been really unfortunate,” she said. “It was very hard for me and I dealt with a lot of stuff that was totally normalized since really young.”

“What would you say to that young person?” host Colbert asked.

“I’d give her a hug, and I’d tell her she’s not alone,” Page replied, holding back tears. “And that she can reach out to people. And that behavior’s not OK.”

Page went on to talk about the industry, global warming and more, adding, “Sorry, I’m really fired up tonight, but it feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married, let’s just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy.”

Prior to becoming the Vice President, Pence served as the governor of Indiana. He has previously denied supporting conversion therapy, though he has publicly opposed same sex marriage and signed into law a bill that made it legal for businesses to cite religious freedom when refusing service to gay and transgender people. In Congress he voted against employment nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people and also voted against the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell.”

Page thinks that these public stances against the LGBTQ community are directly related to the recent attack of Smollett.

“I don’t know [Jussie] personally, I send all of my love — connect the dots, this is what happens,” she said of the crime. “If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you wanna cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f**king stop.”

Page’s words were met with a standing ovation from “The Late Show”’s live audience, as she was in tears by the end of her interview.

Smollett has been hospitalized in Chicago since his attack early Tuesday morning. He told police that he was approached by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, and at one point wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance — now believed to be bleach — on him.

President Donald Trump has spoken out about the attack, saying, “That I can tell you is horrible. I’ve seen it, last night. I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned.”

We know that undocumented immigrants commit crime at lower rates than US-born people; that most undocumented people in the US got here by overstaying their visas, not coming across the southern border illicitly and that undocumented people are a crucial part of the labor force. But we also know that if you can get people excited about imaginary threats, you can distract them from the real ones, and that often the greatest dangers are the people fomenting the excitement.

Mass shootings show why we must stop pandering to white male fragility | Laurie Penny Read more

We already know that the serious threats are coming from inside the house.

Recently, Trump has been telling lurid and apparently baseless stories about women being victimized by traffickers on the border. If this sounds familiar, it’s because he campaigned on pumped-up stories about Mexico sending rapists to the US. But he had nothing to say about the border patrol agent who killed four women in September, one of them transgender, and was only caught because a fifth escaped from his pickup truck.

Last week, when the US government was partly shut down because of the president’s hostage-taking tantrum tactics to get his border wall, native-born white men – not immigrants, not Muslims – proved, once again, to be a major source of violence and hate in America.

Last week, four young white men were arrested on 19 January, in upstate New York for a plot to kill Muslims in nearby Islamberg; they had 23 guns and “makeshift bombs packed with nails and black powder”. One of them had invited Trump to his Eagle Scout ceremony in 2017.

The same day, Christopher Cleary, a 27-year-old white man from Colorado, was arrested in Provo, Utah, after making credible threats to indiscriminately kill women. According to one report, Cleary “had written a long Facebook diatribe about being a virgin and wanting to become ‘the next mass shooter’”. He was already on probation for stalking and making threats of domestic violence – the sort of history that is common among men who commit mass killings.

And in Florida last Wednesday, a 21-year-old white former prison guard was charged with first-degree murder of five women in a bank. A woman who met him in a psychiatric hospital told reporters: “For some reason [he] always hated people and wanted everybody to die.” These days five deaths aren’t even big news, and the likelihood he targeted women specifically was overlooked in most news reports.

Last week, another young white man went on a killing spree, this time in Louisiana, starting with the 20-year-old woman he had been dating, her 17-year-old brother, and her grandfather. Dakota Theriot, 21, reportedly went on to kill his parents and fled in his father’s truck to Virginia, where he was captured at his grandmother’s house. His grandmother had, according to news reports, fled to a motel out of fear of her grandson.

Crimes like these are happening in a broader context of white male extremists committing far-right attacks. A new report from the Anti-Defamation League finds: “In 2018, domestic extremists killed at least 50 people in the US, a sharp increase from the 37 extremist-related murders documented in 2017.” That makes last year “the fourth-deadliest year on record for domestic extremist-related killings since 1970”. What’s more, “every single extremist killing – from Pittsburgh to Parkland – had a link to rightwing extremism.”’

Last week, USA Today reported: “Self-avowed racist James Jackson pleaded guilty Wednesday morning to killing a black man with a sword in 2017, part of his plan to stop interracial relationships and express his hatred for black people.” And this week, two white men reportedly beat and hung a noose around the neck of black gay actor Jussie Smollett.

We know that rightwing extremist violence almost always means white men, and that it usually means racism and misogyny

We know that rightwing extremist violence almost always means white men, and that it usually is accompanied by racism and misogyny – and in the case of last fall’s synagogue massacre, antisemitism. We also know that rightwing politicians have done much to work up their base with fear and with hatred and to normalize violence, the kind that doesn’t get called out enough. The kind that doesn’t get called out enough.

Whatever fears Republicans may stoke about women being abducted on the border, they don’t actually care about violence against women. This is a country where the Republican party fought hard to get a man accused of attempted rape appointed to the supreme court less than a year after they did their best to get Roy Moore elected to the Senate despite the nine women with credible allegations that he sexually abused or harassed them when they were very young. Meanwhile, Trump’s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, is busily dismantling Title IX protections for campus rape victims while gushing sympathy for those charged with sexual assault.

The border wall distracts us from Trump’s own troubles, including his likely culpability in the collusion with Russia. More importantly, it distracts us from things that actually kill a lot of people, including gun violence, car accidents, disasters, poor air quality and lack of access to medical care – and domestic violence when it becomes domestic homicide, as it does about a thousand times a year.

Climate change, too, is a killer; the Paradise fire, which was partly driven by climate change, killed 86 and left more than 10,000 homeless and jobless, and many are suffering now in the midwest’s power vortex-driven extreme cold, which has caused eight deaths so far. Instead of tackling such threats, the Trump administration is busy rolling back on the 2011 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which could cause more than 11,000 deaths annually from air pollution from coal, in addition to fueling runaway climate change and trashing the Paris climate treaty.

These are the walls that would make us safer: around the fossil fuel industry, to prevent mining and lobbying and burning the filthiest of fuels; around the NRA and those who want guns to proliferate; around racists and antisemites and misogynists and homophobes and the entitlement that lies behind the delusions that anyone has the right to take another’s life; and maybe around the White House.

We’re not going to build them, at least not literally, and we know walls don’t work. But in the meantime it serves us all to remember what is and is not a real threat to real lives. And that the most serious threat is coming from inside the building."

Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)

1. Arms control treaty

The US is poised to begin pulling out of one of the world’s most important nuclear treaties. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to announce today that the US will stop participating in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, according to two US officials and multiple diplomatic sources. This would be a stunning development because the 1987 treaty has been a centerpiece of European security since the Cold War. The US and European allies have maintained for years that the Russians are violating the agreement. But if the US does indeed drop out of the treaty, fears of a new nuclear arms race with Russia ramp up considerably.

2. Russia investigation

Senate investigators have gotten new information showing Donald Trump Jr.’s mysterious phone calls ahead of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting were not with his father, three sources with knowledge of the matter told CNN. Records provided to the Senate Intelligence Committee show the calls were between Trump Jr. and two of his business associates, the sources said, and appear to contradict Democrats’ long-held suspicions that the blocked number was from then-candidate Donald Trump. The information could answer a key question about the meeting Trump’s eldest son set up to get Russian dirt on the Clinton campaign.

3. Border security talks

President Trump said the ongoing talks in Congress over border security, aimed at avoiding another government shutdown, are a “waste of time.” The President, in an interview with The New York Times, hinted he’s prepared to circumvent the talks between Democrats and Republicans. Does that mean he’ll declare a national emergency if lawmakers don’t provide money for a border wall? Trump was cryptic, saying he had “set the stage for doing what I’m going to do.” Parts of the government could shut down again by February 15 if lawmakers can’t put together a deal the President likes.

4. Birth tourism

Looks like the US is starting to crack down on what’s known as birth tourism. Three people were arrested on charges of running “birth tourism” companies that catered to Chinese clients in Southern California. This marks the first time that federal charges have been filed over the practice. “Birth tourists” travel to foreign countries to give birth, so their children can get the citizenship of that country. The US confers citizenship automatically upon babies born on its soil. Some other countries do not grant citizenship automatically unless at least one parent is a citizen.

5. ‘Empire’ actor attack

A letter containing white powder was sent to the set of “Empire” just days before actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by two men in Chicago. The white powder turned out to be aspirin, said police, who also released a picture of two people wanted for questioning in the case. Smollett said he was returning from a Subway sandwich shop early Tuesday when two men physically assaulted him, called him homophobic and racist slurs, placed a noose around his neck and poured an unknown substance on him. Investigators have video of Smollett walking into a hotel after the incident with what appears to be a noose around his neck.

The Big Bang Theory cast have revealed they’ve got a huge fan base in prisons – other than Kunal Nayar whose following is mainly made up of accountants.

The gang appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show this week where they spilled all on weeping throughout the final season, which is fair, and their unconventional fandom, who they’ve called their ‘extended family’.

Penny star Kaley Cuoco told Ellen: ‘We do get a lot of letters from prison.’

‘If I was in prison, I would write,’ admitted Johnny Galecki.

Simon Helberg, who plays Howard, joked: ‘When the return address says Riker’s Island, you don’t have to open it.’

Although, Kunal was just confused. ‘I don’t think I know one Indian in prison,’ he teased. ‘I get a lot of letters from accountants.’

There’s just nine episodes left for The Big Bang Theory cast left to film, so emotions are understandably high AF on set.

Kaley recalled a moment she and Johnny had with the crew during shooting that ended in a ‘big group hug’.

‘We were doing a scene before the holiday, we were just blocking, and we were the only two in it, just kind of rehearsing the scene when, out of nowhere, I just started bawling,’ she explained to Ellen.

‘And the crew, all the camera guys and everyone came out and said, “We’re so glad you cried cause we’ve been waiting to cry” and they all gave us this big group hug.’

Jim Parsons, who plays Sheldon, has been holding it together so far, but admitted that he fears he will ‘absolutely lose my shit’.

Speaking about the real world impact of The Big Bang Theory, Amy star Mayim Bialik added: ‘It feels especially impactful that not only can we bring people joy and make them laugh, but we are also putting a different face on science and scientists.’

The Big Bang Theory airs Thursdays on CBS and E4.

DAILY POST had reported that Jussie was attacked and called a Faggot in Chicago on Monday at around 2 AM after he went to a Subway with plans to get food.

When asked about his reaction on the attack that left Jussie with a fractured rib, Trump, being interviewed by veteran journalist April Ryan in the White House, expressed sadness over the situation.

Trump said: “It was horrible. I’ve seen it, last night. I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.

“What I think is the worst sin of all is the fact that we’re allowing people to come into this country and sell drugs and human traffic and do all of these horrible things, that if we had the simplicity of a well-constructed, beautiful barrier or wall, they wouldn’t be able to come into our country.”"

It was February 2017 when I first heard about Chyna Gibson, a beloved stage performer who had been gunned down in her hometown of New Orleans. My stomach dropped, as it does every time I hear about another Black transgender woman being attacked or murdered. Over the next few weeks, I ravenously consumed every article I could find that humanized her (and there weren’t many). I learned that she was only a few years older than me and that she had performed at The Jungle, the first gay club that I had ever gone to in Atlanta. I read that she eventually moved to Northern California, just like I had nearly a year before, and that she had a mother that loved her. In her story — and its end — I saw myself.

The despondency I felt when Gibson was murdered was similar to what I felt when news broke that Empire star Jussie Smollett had been assaulted early Tuesday morning. Though I was used to the Black LGBTQ+ community raising up these heinous acts, this time I witnessed the general public offering up their concern and desire for accountability and progress. It was encouraging to see deep discussion on how white supremacy especially threatens Black queer people. (Though I did notice a number of people and media outlets diminishing the fact that the incident was also steeped in homophobia.) But throughout the day, I was also reminded of all of the times that many of the same folks who were speaking out for Smollett had been silent when scores of our Black transgender sisters were attacked or murdered.

As long as I’ve been an activist and community organizer, I’ve witnessed the disparity of concern that is placed on some people’s brushes with violence over others. When a cisgender Black person, typically a heterosexual man, is attacked or murdered, I can depend on the larger Black community to commiserate. I’ll see signs held with their names at marches, viral hashtags, mentions by public figures, and a demand for change to make conditions better for them. With Smollett, the privilege of celebrity also pulls stronger on the heartstrings of the community. If he weren’t a wealthy, famous, and attractive man, it’s highly doubtful that he would have become a trending topic.

When Black trans women are brutalized, I have mostly come to expect silence from nearly every group that we’re part of. After we are diminished and marginalized in our lives, should we then be murdered, we can expect careless investigators and police officers releasing inaccurate names and genders and an endless justification for our deaths, suggesting we were ‘tricking’ our assailants or that we made bad life choices that placed us in a precarious situation. The hierarchy of whose lives actually matter is clear.

There was no outpouring of social media posts when Dana Martin, a 31-year-old Black transgender woman was murdered earlier this month. As more reports come out about Candice Elease Pinky, a Black trans woman who was chased with a gun and shot in broad daylight in Houston last week, I’m curious to see if, with this widespread concern for Black LGBTQ+ victims, her experience will be elevated as well. And what about the next inevitable attack on a Black trans woman? Will we continue to be erased and ignored from the various communities and movements that we’re apart of?

Similarly, when I think of the LGBTQ+ community at-large, I think of the decades of inaction around the brutality that trans women of color have faced. Every day, I see large non-profit organizations and privileged white queer people invoke the brilliance of Marsha P. Johnson with no regard for the fact that she was allegedly murdered under circumstances similar to recent Black trans victims like Martin, who was found shot multiple times and left for dead. And if there does happen to be a response from groups or organizations, it’s simply the documenting and sharing of information about the attack — not a deployment of resources to support the Black trans organizers working on these issues every day.

Many people find it difficult to see that violence is intersectional, and that we must analyze it with nuance, understanding that various oppressive systems create the conditions for a specific instance to occur. This is why we often see initiatives that focus on alleviating threats of violence for one specific, marginalized identity group at a time: white cisgender women, white LGBTQ+ people, Black cishet men, and on and on. So when a Black transgender woman like Gibson is murdered, people can’t grasp that she was not only murdered for her gender, but also her race, her sexuality, and her socioeconomic status.

I saw myself in Gibson’s experience because she was also a Black trans woman. But we shouldn't have to have the exact same identities to be concerned about others. A major problem with the cisgender public is that there's a reluctance to truly comprehend our experiences even when we're actually living and breathing. If a Black trans victim’s story does gain some traction, they are inevitably reduced to just a number or a statistic, rather than acknowledged as a human being with loved ones and dreams that they left behind.

To adapt the words of James Baldwin: The reality of being a Black transgender woman in this country is to be in mourning almost all of the time. I don’t have the luxury of choosing which group I care about each day. I ache for the Michael Browns, Tamir Rices, Rekia Boyds, and the Gemmel Moores, but I also ache for the Mesha Caldwells, Keanna Mattels, and Sasha Walls. It’s not uncommon for me to read posts from other Black trans women about the difficulty of making it through the days when we learn that another one of our sisters was slain. We check in with each other via text or phone call, just trying to feel less alone in our mourning because we know that transmisogyny renders our experiences as less than others.

The forces against all marginalized people are overwhelming, and doesn’t seem to be letting up in this political climate of brazen bigotry. Just as we call out the white supremacists or the homophobes, we need to call out the transmisogynists and hold them accountable for their particular brand of terrorism. If we can name that the hateful rhetoric from the current president, his administration, and other conservative politicians has contributed to a culture where the Charleston shooting, the events of Charlottesville, or even this attack on Smollett can happen, let's keep the same energy for naming that the anti-trans rhetoric espoused every day — by public figures and the average person — plays a part in a rampant lack of consideration for trans lives."

He recently missed out on an opportunity to host the Oscars after Twitter users exhumed several of his old tweets and comedy routines that included homophobic sentiments and then he refused to apologize for his actions.

Hart wrote on Twitter and Instagram. “Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett,” “This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world????”

In response to his tweet, however, many users on Twitter pointed out the comedian’s history of homophobic comments.

It’s a hate crime.

The actor told investigators he heard them shout ‘MAGA country’, pledging their support to the president.

Page fired a stunning attack on the commander-in-chief and his vocally anti-LGBT Vice President Mike Pence because their hateful policies, she claimed, go hand in hand with the escalating attack on the marginalised.

‘Connect the dots, this is what happens,’ she began, visibly welling up.

‘If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering — what do you think is going to happen?

‘Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street.’

After stressing that she felt ‘fire up’, The Umbrella Academy star highlighted Pence’s shameful homophobic stance.

‘The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife,’ she deadpanned, while Colbert held up a photo of Page with her wife, Emma Porter. ‘He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.’

Concluding her deeply heartfelt appeal, the actress finished: ‘I have travelled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.’

Smollett has received a downpour of support since his attack on Tuesday.

His family have since released a statement stressing that the star’s attack can only be described as a ‘racist and homophobic hate crime’.

They wrote: ‘This was a racial, homophobic hate crime … We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings.

‘These are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. ‘We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme.’"

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning.

“His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

They thanked the public “for their prayers” and said the family was “so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive”.

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of his walk home, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at about 2am Tuesday.

He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Smollett’s manager called police about 40 minutes after Smollett got home, Guglielmi said.

When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still have not seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett’s description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to detectives.

That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Donald Trump campaign’s Make America Great Again slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” the president told reporters.

The spot where Smollett says he was attacked is not far from the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

Ellen Page has emotionally hit out at the Trump administration for spreading hatred which she linked to the suspected racist and homophobic attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett.

On Thursday’s (January 31) episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the lesbian actress condemned Vice President Mike Pence’s anti-LGBT views before telling the studio audience to “connect the dots.”

She said: “In terms of what happened the other day to Jussie… this is what happens.”

A visibly furious Page told Colbert: “I have travelled the world and I have met the most marginalised people you can meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this.”

“This needs to f***ing stop,” she added, to enormous applause from the audience.

Page also explained during the interview that she was “really fired up tonight, but it feels impossible not to be this way right now with the president and the Vice President Mike Pence who, like, wishes I couldn’t be married.”

Turning to speak directly to the audience, she added: “Let’s just be clear, the Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife,” displaying a picture of herself with her wife, Emma Portner.

“He wanted to ban that in Indiana—he believes in conversion therapy,” she said, to boos from the audience.

“He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the Governor of Indiana.”

Donald Trump has condemned the attack on Jussie Smollett

On January 31, two days after the attack on Smollett, Trump condemned the “horrible” assault.

Pressed on the issue by American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan, he said: “That I can tell you is horrible. I’ve seen it last night, I think that’s horrible, It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

There are allegations that the attackers shouted a pro-Trump slogan and racist, homophobic slurs during the violent incident.

Chicago — Jussie Smollett’s family said Thursday that the attack on the black and gay “Empire” actor in downtown Chicago this week was a “hate crime” and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police. Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn’t spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,""

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Smollett’s family issued a statement through a spokesman on Thursday saying they believed he was the victim of an unprovoked “racial and homophobic hate crime” and that he has been forthright with the police, who were still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning.

“His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

They thanked the public “for their prayers” and said the family was “so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive”.

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of his walk home, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at about 2am Tuesday.

He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Smollett’s manager called police about 40 minutes after Smollett got home, Guglielmi said.

When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still have not seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett’s description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to detectives.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Donald Trump campaign’s Make America Great Again slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” the president told reporters.

The spot where Smollett says he was attacked is not far from the Trump International Hotel and Tower."

Jussie Smollett will take to the stage this weekend, just days after being brutally attacked in a possible hate crime.

The Empire actor was assualted in Chicago late on Tuesday night by two men, who beat him up, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him.

The assailants shouted: ‘This is MAGA country’, leading the Chicago Police Department to state they were treating the attack as a possible homophobic and racial hate crime.

Now, just days after the horrendous attack which left Jussie hospitalised, the 35-year-old will perform at the Troubadour in Los Angeles this Saturday, where TMZ claim he will make reference to the attack.

According to the website, Jussie will reference MAGA (Make America Great Again), homophobia and racism during the gig.

This comes as Jussie’s family branded the attack on the actor as an ‘inhumane act of domestic terrorism’.

‘Hateful words lead to hateful actions,’ a statement shared with TMZ read.

‘This was a racial, homophobic hate crime … We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings.

‘These are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme.’

Chicago police have released CCTV images of two possible persons of interest who they want to speak to in relation to the case.

A host of Jussie’s celebrity friends have shared their support for the star, who plays Jamal Lyon on Empire, including the cast of The Big Bang Theory, who stood by Smollett with a heartfelt Instagram post.

Images of two ""people of interest"" have been released by police investigating a suspected hate attack on a US actor.

Jussie Smollett, known for the show Empire, was attacked by two people in Chicago earlier this week.

He was hit, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope was wrapped around his neck.

The suspects are reported to have shouted ""racial and homophobic slurs"" and Jussie says they referenced MAGA - the slogan Make America Great Again.

Jussie hasn't spoken since the attack, but his publicist has released a family statement to the news agency Reuters.

""Our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack,"" it says.

""We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.""

The creator of Empire, Lee Daniels, posted an emotional video on Instagram in the days after the attack.

He said: ""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck.

""America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united.""

US comedian and presenter Steve Harvey also supported the actor with an Instagram video, saying: ""This ain't about sexual preference or nothing. This is about coming to the aid of another brother that has tasted the brutality of hatred and racism and bigotry.""

“Let’s just be clear. The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana.”

Mr Pence, who was the governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017, has long been accused of holding anti-LGBT views.

Page said: “I am fired up tonight, it feels impossible not to feel this way right now, with the president and Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married.

“Let’s just be clear. The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana.”

Page said Mr Pence advocates conversion therapy, although a spokesman for the politician has denied the allegation and told the New York Times in 2016 a “past campaign statement had been misinterpreted”. Ellen Page condemned politicians she accused of homophobia (Ian West/PA)

Page accused Mr Pence of attacking the LGBT community while he was governor, before adding that she thinks there is a link between anti-gay rhetoric and violence being carried out against members of the community.

She pointed to the case of Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who earlier this week was allegedly the victim of a homophobic and racist attack.

Page said: “Connect the dots. This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble – you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?

“Kids are going to be abused and they are going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have travelled the world and I have met the most marginalised people you can meet.

“I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f****** stop.”

The audience burst out into sustained applause while an emotional Page collected herself.

Page was appearing on Colbert to promote her new Netflix show The Umbrella Academy.

LOS ANGELES, Feb 1 — The family of television actor Jussie Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hip-hop musical drama Empire, spoke out yesterday to condemn the assault he reported suffering in Chicago at the hands of two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

Chicago police said detectives have been unable to obtain cell phone records to “independently verify” a key part of Smollett’s story — that he was talking with his manager by phone at the time he was accosted.

Smollett, an African-American who is openly gay in real life, has not commented publicly, but his publicist issued a statement attributed to his family that read:

“Our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.”

It added that Smollett had “told the police everything” and that “his story has never changed.”

But NBC News, citing police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, reported Smollett himself had refused to turn over his cell phone or phone records to investigators to confirm the call to his manager.

“Cell phone records were not provided to investigators when asked,” Guglielmi confirmed in an email to Reuters while declining to clarify who failed to furnish them.

Guglielmi also said police had “no reason to doubt” the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack in the early hours of Tuesday.

Late on Wednesday, investigators released a pair of images from surveillance video showing two “potential persons of interest” sought for questioning in what police said they are treating as a “possible hate crime”.

The two figures, seen only in silhouette, are pictured walking together down a dimly lit sidewalk between a snow-covered median strip and the side of a building. Police said footage from additional cameras was being reviewed.

Police accounts say Smollett reported two men approached him on the street shouting racial and homophobic slurs, then struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Smollett took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police said.

The news spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested the story was a hoax. In releasing the surveillance camera images on Twitter, police said detectives “are taking this development seriously.”

President Donald Trump gave further credence to the incident in remarks to reporters, saying the attack on Smollett was “horrible” and “doesn’t get worse,” Variety reported.

Empire debuted on the Fox network in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show. — Reuters"

Chicago - About a dozen Chicago police detectives have been sifting through footage from nearly every surveillance camera in Streeterville [a neighborhood in the Near North Side community area of Chicago] these last few days, piecing together ""a digital puzzle"" they hope will solve what happened outside the apartment building of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett. So far they've been able to track stretches of Smollett's walk from a Subway shop to his apartment in the 300 block of East North Water Street early Tuesday, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. Somewhere along the way, Smollett said, two men walked up, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him and wrapped a rope around his neck. None of that has been caught by any of the cameras detectives have checked. They did spot two people walking near the area around the time of the incident, but the images are dark and the faces are not clear.

Celebrities and politicians have condemned the attack and voiced their support for Smollett, who is black and openly gay and an activist for LGBTQ [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer] rights.

Representative Bobby Rush, Democrat-Illinois, has called on the FBI to investigate the attack as a hate crime. President Donald Trump, asked about it at a news conference, said, ""It's horrible. Doesn't get worse.""

Taraji Henson, who plays Smollett's character's mother on the show, tweeted: ""I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn't and we all feel his pain right now. @jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone.""

But the lack of progress in the case has fuelled some harsh skepticism on social media. Smollett's family acknowledged that in releasing its first public statement about the incident Thursday.

""We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" the statement said.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received.""

For now, the only lead police appear to have are pictures from a surveillance camera on New Street near Illinois Street, taken between 1:30 am [0730 GMT] and 1:45 am Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on Fox's ""Empire,"" said he was attacked about 15 to 30 minutes later around the corner.

""They are outside on a street walking,"" Guglielmi said. ""They are in the area that we have determined it could have taken place ... in the time and the area. It certainly leads us to have questions for them.""

Smollett told police he had just left a Subway when two men in dark clothes approached and yelled the slurs. Smollett told police he was hit and a chemical - maybe bleach - was poured on him. They put a rope around his neck and yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" he told detectives. The initials stand for Make America Great Again, a Trump campaign slogan.

Police were called just after 2:30 a.m. A friend of the actor told responding officers that ""a noose was placed over the friend's neck.""

So far, police detectives have used at least three surveillance cameras to piece together what Guglielmi called ""a digital puzzle,"" tracking the movements of Smollett and the two people of interest. Smollett is seen walking in one direction on a street and the two other people are walking the other way.

""One was going north and one going south,"" Guglielmi said. There are times when Smollett and the two people are out of range.

""They kind of all go off camera and reappear in different cameras,"" he said. ""You almost have to watch them at the same time"" because each camera shows the same time stamp but from different angles.

There is no footage so far of any attack, he said.

Guglielmi said footage from the apartment building is sharp and shows Smollett walking in with a white rope around his neck. ""We can confirm that, yeah, it was a rope, tied as a noose. It was tied that way,"" he said. ""You can tell it's a rope tied as a noose.""

Forty minutes later, as officers responded with their body cameras turned on, Smollett still had the rope around his neck, but it was untied.

""It was draped around his neck still, but it's not fashioned as a noose,"" Guglielmi said. ""It was loosely dangling rope."" Officers took the rope and some of Smollett's clothing as evidence.

Smollett went on his own to Northwestern Memorial Hospital nearby and was treated for cuts to his face, according to Guglielmi.

The actor told police he was on the phone with his manager during the attack, but both of them have refused to turn over their phone records, Guglielmi said.

""Both the victim and his manager have made statements to detectives that they were on the phone with each other,"" the police spokesman said in an email. ""We were not able to independently verify that because they did not turn over cellphone records to police when asked.

""That being said, we have no reason to doubt the statements given, and the reason that detectives requested cellphone records is because the manager and the victim have a financial relationship with each other,"" he added. ""Because of that, independent verification was needed for the investigation.""

Brandon Moore, Smollett's music manager, declined to comment to The Chicago Tribune. ""Nothing I can tell you,"" he said by phone.

A week before Smollett reported the attack, a letter containing white powder and making racial and homophobic threats was mailed to the actor at Cinespace Chicago Film Studios, where ""Empire"" is filmed, according to police. The letter triggered a hazardous materials call, but fire crews determined the powder was not dangerous.

The FBI has since taken over the investigation into the letter while Chicago police continue to look into Tuesday's incident, authorities said.

""Empire,"" which premiered on the Fox network in 2015, is a musical drama that films in Chicago for most of the year. Smollett plays a gay musician.

Production on ""Empire"" resumed Thursday after Chicago's subzero temperatures shut down filming of TV shows across the city Wednesday. ""Empire"" filmed scenes at Cinespace, a source told the Tribune.

Trump, Pelosi stances on wall suggest deal will be difficult

WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared Thursday that there'll be no ""wall money"" in any compromise border security deal as she and President Donald Trump signaled that congressional negotiators may never satisfy his demands for his cherished Southwest border proposal.

Trump, who in recent weeks has expressed indifference to whether the term ""wall"" or something else is used, clung with renewed tenacity to the word that became his campaign mantra, declaring, ""A wall is a wall."" Yet in a series of tweets and statements, he issued conflicting messages about what he'd need to declare victory and suggested that merely repairing existing structures along the boundary could be a major component of a triumph.

Amid signs that Trump's leverage in Congress is atrophying, he seemed to aim one tweet at his conservative followers. He wrote that Democrats ""are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I've got you covered. Wall is already being built, I don't expect much help!""

Pelosi, D-Calif., left the door open for an accord that could finance some barriers, citing what she said was already existing ""Normandy fencing"" that blocks vehicles.

""If the president wants to call that a wall, he can call that a wall,"" she told reporters. She added: ""Is there a place for enhanced fencing? Normandy fencing would work.""

Long johns to short sleeves: Rapid thaw follows polar blast

CHICAGO -- In Illinois, temperatures could rise by 80 degrees within days. In Michigan, melting snow and rain and a 17-mile ice jam could lead to flooding. Across the Midwest, the sudden warmth was sure to bring more broken roads and busted water mains.

The polar vortex that brought many cities to a standstill was expected to end with a rapid thaw that experts say could be unprecedented. But the sudden swing from long johns to light jackets and short sleeves could create problems of its own.

""I don't think there's ever been a case where we've seen (such a big) shift in temperatures,"" in the winter, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the Weather Underground firm. ""Past record-cold waves have not dissipated this quickly. ... Here we are going right into spring-like temperatures.""

On Thursday, the system marched east, spreading arctic conditions over an area from Buffalo to Brooklyn. In western New York, a storm that dumped up to 20 inches of snow (51 centimeters) gave way to subzero temperatures and face-stinging wind chills. In New York City, about 200 firefighters battling a blaze in a commercial building took turns getting warm on buses. The number of deaths that could be blamed on the cold climbed to at least 15.

For the nation's midsection, relief was as close as the weekend.

US expected to announce treaty withdrawal as soon as Friday

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is poised to announce Friday that it is withdrawing from a treaty that has been a centerpiece of superpower arms control since the Cold War and whose demise some analysts worry could fuel a new arms race.

An American withdrawal, which has been expected for months, would follow years of unresolved dispute over Russian compliance with the pact, known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty. It was the first arms control measure to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched cruise missiles with a range between 500 kilometers (310 miles) and 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles). Russia denies that it has been in violation.

U.S. officials also have expressed worry that China, which is not party to the 1987 treaty, is gaining a significant military advantage in Asia by deploying large numbers of missiles with ranges beyond the treaty's limit. Leaving the INF treaty would allow the Trump administration to counter the Chinese, but it's unclear how it would do that.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in early December that Washington would give Moscow 60 days to return to compliance before it gave formal notice of withdrawal, with actual withdrawal taking place six months later. The 60-day deadline expires on Saturday, and the administration is expected to say as early as Friday that efforts to work out a compliance deal have failed and that it would suspend its compliance with the treaty's terms.

The State Department said Pompeo would make a public statement on Friday morning, but it did not mention the topic.

Trump plan would channel prescription discounts to patients

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration Thursday unveiled a plan to channel now-hidden prescription drug rebates directly to patients, saying it would bypass middlemen and lower prices for consumers.

The proposed regulation from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar would eliminate behind-the-scenes discounts among drugmakers, insurers and go-betweens and instead require that they be paid directly to consumers when they buy their medications.

The idea is to do away with a hidden cost seen as contributing to artificially high list prices for prescription drugs. The proposal was co-authored with the Health and Human Services inspector general's office.

The plan comes as President Donald Trump is under political pressure to deliver results on his repeated promises to slash prescription drug costs. Democrats in Congress want to empower Medicare to directly negotiate prices with drug companies, but Republicans prefer a market-based approach that keeps the government out of setting prices.

The impact for consumers would not be immediate, since the changes would take effect over the next year if all goes according to plan. Also, drugmakers do not currently provide discounts for all their medications.

US border agency says it's made biggest-ever fentanyl bust

PHOENIX -- U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials announced Thursday their biggest fentanyl bust ever, saying they captured nearly 254 pounds (114 kilograms) of the synthetic drug that is fueling a national epidemic of fatal opioid overdoses from a secret compartment inside a load of Mexican produce heading into Arizona.

The drug was found hidden Saturday morning in a compartment under the rear floor of a tractor-trailer after a scan during a secondary inspection indicated ""some anomalies"" in the load, and the agency's police dog team alerted officers to the presence of drugs, Nogales CBP Port Director Michael Humphries said.

Most of the seized fentanyl with an overall street value of about $3.5 million was in white powder form, but about 2 pounds of it (1 kilogram) was contained in pills. Agents also seized nearly 395 pounds (179 kilograms) of methamphetamine with a street value of $1.18 million, Humphries said.

""The size of a few grains of salt of fentanyl, which is a dangerous opioid, can kill a person very quickly,"" Humphries said. The seizure, he said, had prevented an immeasurable number of doses of the drug ""that could have harmed so many families.""

President Donald Trump praised the bust in a tweet Thursday, writing: ""Our great U.S. Border Patrol Agents made the biggest Fentanyl bust in our Country's history. Thanks, as always, for a job well done!""

Venezuela opposition leader to police: Leave my family alone

CARACAS, Venezuela -- The Venezuelan opposition leader challenging Nicolas Maduro's claim to the presidency warned officers from a feared state security unit Thursday to stay away from his family after he accused them of showing up at his apartment in a tense brush with the very force he is trying to persuade to switch allegiance and back him.

A visibly flustered but determined Juan Guaido told a crowd gathered at a university that members of a special police unit known for its brutal tactics had gone to his high-rise apartment in a middle-class neighborhood of Caracas while his 20-month-old daughter was inside.

""I hold you responsible for anything that might happen to my baby,"" the 35-year-old lawmaker said as his wife stood beside him.

He rushed home and emerged an hour later holding his smiling daughter, named for Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan patriot who paved the way for Venezuela's independence, and described how four agents from the police's Special Action Force had arrived at the building and asked security guards stationed there for his wife.

""Children are sacred,"" he admonished the agents as a crowd of supporters applauded. ""Wives are sacred. So don't cross that red line.""

Trump says State of Union address to stress 'unity'

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Thursday that ""unity"" will be the theme of his first State of the Union address under divided government and that he respects Stacey Abrams, who will give the Democratic response.

""I hope she does a good job. I respect her,"" Trump said of Abrams, who will be the first black woman to deliver the rebuttal.

Trump will give his speech Tuesday before a joint session of Congress at a sensitive time in talks over keeping the government open and funding the border wall he is demanding as part of any deal. Members of Congress are inviting federal workers worried about another shutdown after Feb. 15. Special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian election meddling also hovers.

Trump will also be surrounded by living reminders of the changes wrought by the 2018 midterm elections that ushered Democrats into the House majority.

Sitting behind him: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who maneuvered the president into retreating last week on his demand for a border wall in exchange for an end to the longest government shutdown in history.

Study: Many small kids in US are using too much toothpaste

NEW YORK -- Too many young kids are using too much toothpaste, increasing their risk of streaky or splotchy teeth when they get older, according to a government survey released Thursday.

About 40 percent of kids ages 3 to 6 used a brush that was full or half-full of toothpaste, even though experts recommend no more than a pea-sized amount, the study found.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention findings were based on a survey of parents of more than 5,000 kids ages 3 to 15.

Health officials recommend that all people drink fluoridated water, and that everyone 2 or older brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.

But the amount is important. Children under 3 are only supposed to use a smear of toothpaste the size of a grain of rice. Kids 3 to 6 are supposed to keep it to a pea-sized amount.

'Empire' actor's family calls for justice in Chicago attack

CHICAGO -- Jussie Smollett's family said Thursday that the attack on the black and gay ""Empire"" actor in downtown Chicago this week was a ""hate crime"" and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn't spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett's family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

They thanked the public ""for their prayers"" and said the family is ""so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.""

""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,"" the family said. ""Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.""

Facebook says Apple is restoring a key developer tool

NEW YORK -- Facebook says Apple is restoring its access to a key development tool that the iPhone maker disabled Wednesday.

Late Tuesday, TechCrunch reported that Facebook paid teens and other users who agreed to download an app called Facebook Research. That app could extensively track their phone and web use. Apple said Facebook was abusing the tool , known as a developer enterprise certificate, to distribute the app on iPhones in a way that allowed the social network to sidestep Apple restrictions on data collection.

By revoking the certificate for the iOS software that powers the iPhone and iPad, Apple closed off Facebook's efforts to sidestep Apple's app store and its tighter rules on privacy.

Apple did not immediately respond to a message for comment Thursday afternoon. Facebook did not say whether it agreed to any conditions for the certificate restoration.

In an internal memo sent on Wednesday, Facebook told employees it is ""working closely"" with Apple to reinstate access. It also told workers to install the public versions of apps from the app store. Apps that it said ""may not work"" included internal versions of Facebook, Workplace, Instagram and the Ride app, which helps workers with transportation. WhatsApp was not affected."

Smollett’s family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked “racial and homophobic hate crime” and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

They thanked the public “for their prayers” and said the family is “so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.”

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said. “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

They said such incidents will continue to happen until people are held accountable.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama “Empire” is shot in Chicago and follows an African-American family navigating the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Smollett has told police that he was walking home from a Subway restaurant when the attack occurred. Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of his walk home, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett’s manager called police about 40 minutes after Smollett got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven’t seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett’s description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels. Smollett was walking in an area that has high-end hotels and restaurants. It also has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett’s walk home, Guglielmi said.

It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn’t far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned. CC

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett’s manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven’t seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett’s description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

President Trump expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday."

Chicago police said detectives have been unable to obtain cell phone records to “independently verify” a key part of Smollett’s story - that he was talking with his manager by phone at the time he was accosted.

Smollett, an African-American who is openly gay in real life, has not commented publicly, but his publicist issued a statement attributed to his family that read:

“Our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.”

It added that Smollett had “told the police everything” and that “his story has never changed.”

But NBC News, citing police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, reported Smollett himself had refused to turn over his cell phone or phone records to investigators to confirm the call to his manager.

“Cell phone records were not provided to investigators when asked,” Guglielmi confirmed in an email to Reuters while declining to clarify who failed to furnish them.

Guglielmi also said police had “no reason to doubt” the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack in the early hours of Tuesday.

Late on Wednesday, investigators released a pair of images from surveillance video showing two “potential persons of interest” sought for questioning in what police said they are treating as a “possible hate crime.”

The two figures, seen only in silhouette, are pictured walking together down a dimly lit sidewalk between a snow-covered median strip and the side of a building. Police said footage from additional cameras was being reviewed.

Police accounts say Smollett reported two men approached him on the street shouting racial and homophobic slurs, then struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Smollett took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police said.

The news spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested the story was a hoax. In releasing the surveillance camera images on Twitter, police said detectives “are taking this development seriously.”

President Donald Trump gave further credence to the incident in remarks to reporters, saying the attack on Smollett was “horrible” and “doesn’t get worse,” Variety reported.

The Latest: Trump pulls the plug on arms treaty with Russia

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is pulling the plug on a nuclear arms treaty with Russia, accusing Moscow of violating the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty with “impunity” by deploying banned missiles.

Moscow denies it is in violation and has accused Washington of resisting its efforts to resolve the dispute.

The Trump decision reflects his administration’s view that the arms treaty was an unacceptable obstacle to more forcefully confronting not only Russia but also China.

The move announced Friday sets the stage for delicate talks with U.S. allies over potential new American missile deployments.

Democrats in Congress and some arms control advocates criticized Trump’s decision as opening the door to an arms race.

IMMIGRATION-FORCE-FEEDING

ICE force-feeding detainees on hunger strike

Three times a day, a 22-year-old Indian man on a hunger strike says, he is dragged from his cell in a Texas immigration detention center, his feet scraping the floor as he goes. He’s put on a bed where he says his arms and legs are strapped down and a group of people force-feed him by pouring liquid into tubes pushed through his nose.

The man is among a group of nine detainees in the El Paso facility who immigration officials acknowledged Friday are being hydrated and fed against their will under court orders. That’s up from six men who were being fed through nasal tubes Wednesday when the Associated Press first reported on the force-feeding.

In a statement, ICE said it fully respects the rights of all people to voice their opinion without interference.

GOVERNOR-KLAN-BLACKFACE-THE LATEST

The Latest: Planned Parenthood calls for Northam to resign

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Planned Parenthood is calling on Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to resign after he acknowledged appearing in a photo wearing a racist costume.

The abortion-rights group joins a growing list of Democrats and progressive advocacy groups calling for the Democratic governor to step aside.

Northam has apologized for appearing in a photo in which one person is dressed in blackface and another is wearing a full Ku Klux Klan uniform, but he is resisting calls to resign. The photo appeared in his 1984 medical school yearbook.

Pro-choice groups such as Planned Parenthood have been key supporters of Northam during his political career. Northam has recently come under fire from Republicans for supporting looser restrictions on late-term abortions.

CHICAGO (AP) — A 90-year-old woman has died in the extreme cold after locking herself out of her home in southwestern Michigan.

WOOD-TV says Ada Salna was found covered with snow on the steps of her home Wednesday near Three Rivers in St. Joseph County. Pathologist Joyce deJong says Salna died of hypothermia. Blood loss from a cut also contributed to her death.

The TV station says Salna was feeding birds when she was locked out.

STATE OF UNION-TRUMP-PREVIEW

Trump’s State of the Union to focus on ‘choosing greatness’

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is ready to deliver his State of the Union speech following a roller-coaster will-it-or-won’t-it-happen ride. His topic is to be “choosing greatness.”

White House officials say Trump is not expected to dwell on the government shutdown or on the looming Feb. 15 deadline for a budget deal. Instead, Trump is expected to strike a unifying tone and focus on areas of potential bipartisan compromise.

A senior administration official said Friday that Trump will speak on five areas: immigration, infrastructure, drug pricing, trade and international diplomacy. The official wasn’t authorized to publicly discuss about the speech and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The White House didn’t address Trump’s suggestion Friday that he may use the speech to announce his plans to declare a national emergency to bypass Congress and build his long-promised border wall.

VENEZUELA-POLITICAL CRISIS-THE LATEST

The Latest: Bolton: US to send humanitarian aid to Venezuela

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton has tweeted that the United States plans to send humanitarian aid to Venezuela despite President Nicolas Maduro’s refusal to accept aid.

Bolton’s comments come after opposition leader Juan Guaido said late Thursday that he would defy the government aid ban and receive large convoys of medicine into Venezuela with the help of neighboring nations.

Bolton tweeted on Friday: “Pursuant to the request of Interim President Juan Guaido, and in consultation with his officials the US will mobilize and transport humanitarian aid_medicine, surgical supplies, and nutritional supplements for the people of Venezuela. It’s time for Maduro to get out of the way.”

Guaido declared last week that he’s interim president of Venezuela and vowed to topple Maduro’s administration. He’s backed by the United States and roughly two dozen nations.

MEASLES OUTBREAK-EXEMPTIONS

Northwest US measles cases prompt look at vaccine exemptions

VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) — A measles outbreak near Portland, Oregon, has revived a bitter debate over so-called personal belief exemptions to childhood vaccinations.

At least 43 people in Washington and Oregon have fallen ill in recent weeks with the extraordinarily contagious virus.

More than a dozen more cases are suspected, and people who were exposed to the disease traveled to Hawaii and Bend, Oregon.

That raises the possibility of more cases among the unvaccinated.

Now state lawmakers in Washington want to remove a provision that allows parents to opt out of vaccines for personal or philosophical beliefs.

Four percent of Washington secondary school students have non-medical vaccine exemptions.

In Oregon, which has a similar law, 7.5 percent of kindergarteners in 2018 were missing shots for non-medical reasons.

BOOKS-SALINGER

Open the vaults: Unpublished Salinger work to be released

NEW YORK (AP) — One of the book world’s publishing’s greatest mysteries is finally ending: J.D. Salinger’s son says previously unpublished work by his late father will be coming out.

In comments which appeared Friday in The Guardian, Matt Salinger confirmed longstanding reports that the author “The Catcher in the Rye” had continued to write long after he stopped publishing books. He and Salinger’s widow are “going as fast as we freaking can” to prepare the material for release.

Salinger says any new work might be years away and did not cite any specific titles or plots. He did indicate that the Glass family made famous in such fiction as “Franny and Zooey” would be seen again.

J.D. Salinger died in 2010. This year marks the centennial of his birth.

EMPIRE CAST MEMBER-ATTACK

‘Empire’ actor defends himself in 1st comments since attack

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett is disputing rumors circulating on social media that he has been less than cooperative with the investigation into a racially-charged attack in which he says two masked men beat him and wrapped a rope around his neck in downtown Chicago.

In his first public statement since the attack early Tuesday, the black and gay actor said in a news release that he has been completely honest and “consistent on every level” with the police. He also said he is grateful for the outpouring of support he’s received.

Police are searching for surveillance footage of the attack, but they say video does show Smollett returning home with a rope around his neck just after he says he was beaten.

Several LGBTQ and black activist groups are planning to hold a rally in New York City on Friday evening for Smollett and other LGBTQ survivors of violent crime.

ELECTION 2020-CORY BOOKER-THE LATEST

The Latest: Booker wants to keep private health insurance

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker says he wants universal health insurance coverage in the U.S. But the New Jersey senator says he doesn’t want to eliminate private insurance.

That’s one of the differences between Booker and one of his 2020 White House rivals, Sen. Kamala Harris of California.

She made headlines this week by saying she wants to expand Medicare to cover all Americans, and that could mean eliminating private health insurance plans. Such a move would be a politically difficult and represent a drastic overall to the system.

Booker is suggesting he would back more incremental proposals that would expand Medicare, while allowing private insurers to continue to provide coverage.

Trump suspends arms treaty, citing Chinese, Russian threats

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is pulling the plug on a decades-old nuclear arms treaty with Russia, lifting what it sees as unreasonable constraints on competing with a resurgent Russia and a more assertive China. The move announced Friday sets the stage for delicate talks with U.S. allies over potential new American missile deployments.

In explaining his decision, which he had foreshadowed months ago, President Donald Trump accused Moscow of violating the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty with “impunity” by deploying banned missiles. Moscow denies it is in violation and has accused Washington of resisting its efforts to resolve the dispute.

Democrats in Congress and some arms control advocates criticized Trump’s decision as opening the door to an arms race.

“The U.S. threat to terminate the treaty will not bring Russia back into compliance and could unleash a dangerous and costly new missile competition between the United States and Russia in Europe and beyond,” the private Arms Control Association said. It argued that Washington had not exhausted options for drawing Russia back into compliance.

Trump said in a statement that the U.S. will “move forward” with developing its own military response options to Russia’s banned deployment of cruise missiles that could target western Europe.

ICE force-feeding detainees on hunger strike

Three times a day, a 22-year-old Indian man on a hunger strike says, he is dragged from his cell in a Texas immigration detention center, his feet scraping the floor as he goes. He’s put on a bed where he says his arms and legs are strapped down and a group of people force-feed him by pouring liquid into tubes pushed through his nose.

The man is among a group of nine detainees in the El Paso facility who immigration officials acknowledged Friday are being hydrated and fed against their will under court orders. That’s up from six men who were being fed through nasal tubes Wednesday when The Associated Press first reported on the force-feeding.

“They tie us on the force-feeding bed, and then they put a lot of liquid into the tubes, and the pressure is immense so we end up vomiting it out,” said the man, who called the AP Friday from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility where he is being held. “We can’t talk properly, and we can’t breathe properly. The pipe is not an easy process, but they try to push it down our noses and throats.”

Speaking through an interpreter, the hunger striker interviewed by the AP said he has lost 50 pounds since he began refusing food more than a month ago after coming to the United States seeking asylum. AP is only using his last name, Singh, out of family concerns for his safety in the U.S. and India. He said he is refusing food to protest guards’ unfair treatment of him and other Punjabis, who he said are being denied bond while other detainees from other countries were allowed out.

In a statement, ICE said it fully respects the rights of all people to voice their opinion without interference.

Virginia governor apologizes for racist photo; not resigning

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam apologized on Friday for a racist photo in which he appeared more than 30 years ago, but said he did not intend to heed calls to resign from both Republicans and prominent fellow Democrats, including several presidential hopefuls.

The yearbook images were first published Friday by the conservative news outlet Big League Politics. The Virginian-Pilot later obtained a copy from Eastern Virginia Medical School, which Northam attended. The photo shows two people looking at the camera — one in blackface wearing a hat, bow tie and plaid pants; the other in a full Ku Klux Klan robe.

An Associated Press reporter saw the yearbook page and confirmed its authenticity at the medical school.

In his first apology, issued in a written statement Friday night, Northam called the costume he wore “clearly racist and offensive,” but he didn’t say which one he had worn.

He later issued a video statement saying he was “deeply sorry” but still committed to serving the “remainder of my term.”

Human toll of cold: more than 2 dozen dead, hundreds hurt

CHICAGO (AP) — The dangerous cold and heavy snow that hobbled the northern U.S. this week has retreated, but not before exacting a human toll: more than two dozen weather-related deaths in eight states and hundreds of injuries, including frostbite, broken bones, heart attacks and carbon monoxide poisoning.

In Illinois alone, hospitals reported more than 220 cases of frostbite and hypothermia since Tuesday, when the polar vortex moved in and overnight temperatures plunged to minus 30 (minus 34 Celsius) or lower — with wind chills of minus 50 (minus 45 Celsius) or worse in some areas.

Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis normally sees around 30 frostbite patients in an entire winter. It admitted 18 in the past week, spokeswoman Christine Hill said Friday.

“I definitely saw more frostbite than I’ve ever seen in my entire career just in the last three days,” said Dr. Andrea Rowland-Fischer, an emergency department physician at Hennepin Healthcare.

Most of those patients, she said, had underlying problems that made it difficult for them to take care of themselves: the developmentally delayed, the mentally ill, the very young and the very old. They also included people with injuries related to drugs and alcohol — people who passed out or did not realize they were cold or injured.

Trump’s State of the Union to focus on ‘choosing greatness’

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump heads into his State of the Union address dogged by bruising midterm losses and sinking poll numbers, wounded by a blistering standoff with Democrats. But for the stately speech, he plans to embrace unity — at least for the night.

“Choosing Greatness” is the official White House theme.

Addressing the nation at the weakest point of his presidency, Trump will seek to use the ceremonial moment to pitch a unifying vision and reset relations with Democrats. The prime-time presidential set-piece Tuesday night comes amid a bitter border wall fight that nearly derailed the speech altogether, but Trump is not expected to dwell on the rancor.

“I really think it’s going to be a speech that’s going to cover a lot of territory, but part of it’s going to be unity,” Trump told reporters this week.

While Trump may strive for a unifying tone for the evening, harsh rhetoric has been a constant of his presidency. Previous efforts by Trump to shift gears have been short-lived and have struck many as disingenuous, given the ferocity with which he often takes on Democrats. Even on Friday, Trump was going after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi by name, calling her clueless and her ideas dangerous.

Struggle for control of Venezuela returning to the streets

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Momentum is growing for Venezuela’s opposition movement led by lawmaker Juan Guaido, who has called supporters back into the streets for nationwide protests Saturday, escalating pressure on embattled President Nicolas Maduro to step down.

A defiant Maduro’s socialist government has called on its own loyalists to flood the streets waving flags to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Bolivarian revolution launched by the late Hugo Chavez.

The dueling demonstrations will play out amid a political standoff in its second week of heightened tensions — and with the potential to spark violent clashes between the opposition and security forces.

Guaido has turned down offers from the presidents of Mexico and Uruguay to negotiate with Maduro. In a letter Guaido urged both presidents to back Venezuela’s struggle, saying to remain neutral aligns them with Maduro.

“At this historical moment that our country is going through, to be neutral is to be on the side of the regime that has condemned hundreds of thousands of human beings to misery, hunger and exile — including death,” he said.

AP FACT CHECK: Taxpayers have already spent money on Foxconn

Confusion has swirled around electronic manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group’s plans for a $10 billion campus in southeast Wisconsin that promised to bring 13,000 jobs — most of them blue-collar factory positions— to build high-tech display screens.

Wisconsin lawmakers offered up to $2.85 billion worth of incentives in 2017 to lure the world’s largest electronics manufacturer to the state, sparking criticism that the state was giving away too much money.

But Foxconn’s plans were thrown into doubt Wednesday when a company official said that the Taiwanese company was backing away from making LCD panels in favor of becoming a “technology hub” employing mostly research, development and design jobs. The company again shifted course Friday, saying it would return to earlier plans to make the LCD panels after a conversation between Foxconn’s chairman and President Donald Trump.

Foxconn’s contradictory statements triggered a flurry of finger-pointing among Wisconsin politicians this week.

In a joint statement, Wisconsin’s Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald defended the Foxconn incentive package they helped create.

Northwest measles outbreak revives debate over vaccine laws

VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) — A measles outbreak near Portland, Oregon, has revived a bitter debate over so-called “philosophical” exemptions to childhood vaccinations as public health officials across the Pacific Northwest scramble to limit the fallout.

At least 44 people in Washington and Oregon have fallen ill in recent weeks with the extraordinarily contagious virus, which was eradicated in the U.S. in 2000 as a result of immunization but arrives periodically with overseas travelers. More than a half-dozen more cases are suspected, and people who were exposed to the disease traveled to Hawaii and Bend, Oregon, raising the possibility of more diagnoses in the unvaccinated.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee last week declared a state of emergency because of the outbreak.

“I would hope that this ends soon, but this could go on for weeks, if not months,” said Dr. Alan Melnick, public health director in Clark County, Washington, just north of Portland. The county has had most of the diagnosed cases so far. “

Of the confirmed cases, 37 are people who were not immunized. Most of the confirmed cases have been children under 10. Authorities said Friday one case was a person who had received one dose of the measles vaccine.

Patriots have habit of Super Bowl trips, Rams are newcomers

ATLANTA (AP) — Hey, have you guys been here before?

If you’re a New England Patriot, the answer pretty much is “all the time.”

If you play for the Rams, the reply basically is “never in my life.”

So if experience is a factor in Sunday’s Super Bowl, the overwhelming edge is with the 2½-point favorites from Foxborough who are 5-3 in NFL title games with Tom Brady at quarterback and Bill Belichick in the hoodie on the sideline.

The Rams, whose past two Super trips were representing St. Louis in 2000 and ’02, have four players who have gotten this far. New England has four on its defensive line alone.

Perfect attendance: 3 fans to keep Super Bowl streak alive

ATLANTA (AP) — Don Crisman knows precisely when the streak began: Jan. 15, 1967. The ticket price for the Super Bowl at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was $12.

“Good seats,” Crisman, 82, said. “You could buy $6 tickets, and $10. There were three prices.”

On Sunday, Crisman, Gregory Eaton and Tom Henschel will attend Super Bowl 53 . They’re the last surviving members of the Never Miss a Super Bowl Club, the only known fans with a perfect attendance record for the NFL’s biggest game.

“I’ve missed weddings, I’ve missed funerals, but I’ve never missed a Super Bowl,” said Eaton, 79, from Lansing, Michigan. “Anyone in my family knows don’t plan anything because I’m gone that week.”

Ticket prices have soared through the years. Eaton said he paid $2,000 for his ticket to Sunday’s Rams-Patriots game. The most he paid was $3,000 for Super Bowl 48 in East Rutherford, New Jersey, in 2014.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared Thursday that there’ll be no “wall money” in any compromise border security deal as she and President Donald Trump signalled that congressional negotiators may never satisfy his demands for his cherished Southwest border proposal.

Trump, who in recent weeks has expressed indifference to whether the term “wall” or something else is used, clung with renewed tenacity to the word that became his campaign mantra, declaring, “A wall is a wall.” Yet in a series of tweets and statements, he issued conflicting messages about what he’d need to declare victory and suggested that merely repairing existing structures along the boundary could be a major component of a triumph.

Amid signs that Trump’s leverage in Congress is atrophying, he seemed to aim one tweet at his conservative followers. He wrote that Democrats “are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I’ve got you covered. Wall is already being built, I don’t expect much help!”

Pelosi, D-Calif., left the door open for an accord that could finance some barriers, citing what she said was already existing “Normandy fencing” that blocks vehicles.

“If the president wants to call that a wall, he can call that a wall,” she told reporters. She added: “Is there a place for enhanced fencing? Normandy fencing would work.”

Long johns to short sleeves: Rapid thaw follows polar blast

CHICAGO (AP) — In Illinois, temperatures could rise by 80 degrees within days. In Michigan, melting snow and rain and a 17-mile ice jam could lead to flooding. Across the Midwest, the sudden warmth was sure to bring more broken roads and busted water mains.

The polar vortex that brought many cities to a standstill was expected to end with a rapid thaw that experts say could be unprecedented. But the sudden swing from long johns to light jackets and short sleeves could create problems of its own.

“I don’t think there’s ever been a case where we’ve seen (such a big) shift in temperatures,” in the winter, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the Weather Underground firm. “Past record-cold waves have not dissipated this quickly. … Here we are going right into spring-like temperatures.”

On Thursday, the system marched east, spreading arctic conditions over an area from Buffalo to Brooklyn. In western New York, a storm that dumped up to 20 inches of snow (51 centimetres) gave way to subzero temperatures and face-stinging wind chills. In New York City, about 200 firefighters battling a blaze in a commercial building took turns getting warm on buses. The number of deaths that could be blamed on the cold climbed to at least 15.

For the nation’s midsection, relief was as close as the weekend.

US expected to announce treaty withdrawal as soon as Friday

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is poised to announce Friday that it is withdrawing from a treaty that has been a centerpiece of superpower arms control since the Cold War and whose demise some analysts worry could fuel a new arms race.

An American withdrawal, which has been expected for months, would follow years of unresolved dispute over Russian compliance with the pact, known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty. It was the first arms control measure to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched cruise missiles with a range between 500 kilometres (310 miles) and 5,000 kilometres (3,100 miles). Russia denies that it has been in violation.

U.S. officials also have expressed worry that China, which is not party to the 1987 treaty, is gaining a significant military advantage in Asia by deploying large numbers of missiles with ranges beyond the treaty’s limit. Leaving the INF treaty would allow the Trump administration to counter the Chinese, but it’s unclear how it would do that.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in early December that Washington would give Moscow 60 days to return to compliance before it gave formal notice of withdrawal, with actual withdrawal taking place six months later. The 60-day deadline expires on Saturday, and the administration is expected to say as early as Friday that efforts to work out a compliance deal have failed and that it would suspend its compliance with the treaty’s terms.

The State Department said Pompeo would make a public statement on Friday morning, but it did not mention the topic.

Trump plan would channel prescription discounts to patients

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration Thursday unveiled a plan to channel now-hidden prescription drug rebates directly to patients, saying it would bypass middlemen and lower prices for consumers.

The proposed regulation from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar would eliminate behind-the-scenes discounts among drugmakers, insurers and go-betweens and instead require that they be paid directly to consumers when they buy their medications.

The idea is to do away with a hidden cost seen as contributing to artificially high list prices for prescription drugs. The proposal was co-authored with the Health and Human Services inspector general’s office.

The plan comes as President Donald Trump is under political pressure to deliver results on his repeated promises to slash prescription drug costs. Democrats in Congress want to empower Medicare to directly negotiate prices with drug companies, but Republicans prefer a market-based approach that keeps the government out of setting prices.

The impact for consumers would not be immediate, since the changes would take effect over the next year if all goes according to plan. Also, drugmakers do not currently provide discounts for all their medications.

US border agency says it’s made biggest-ever fentanyl bust

PHOENIX (AP) — U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials announced Thursday their biggest fentanyl bust ever, saying they captured nearly 254 pounds (114 kilograms) of the synthetic drug that is fueling a national epidemic of fatal opioid overdoses from a secret compartment inside a load of Mexican produce heading into Arizona.

The drug was found hidden Saturday morning in a compartment under the rear floor of a tractor-trailer after a scan during a secondary inspection indicated “some anomalies” in the load, and the agency’s police dog team alerted officers to the presence of drugs, Nogales CBP Port Director Michael Humphries said.

Most of the seized fentanyl with an overall street value of about $3.5 million was in white powder form, but about 2 pounds of it (1 kilogram) was contained in pills. Agents also seized nearly 395 pounds (179 kilograms) of methamphetamine with a street value of $1.18 million, Humphries said.

“The size of a few grains of salt of fentanyl, which is a dangerous opioid, can kill a person very quickly,” Humphries said. The seizure, he said, had prevented an immeasurable number of doses of the drug “that could have harmed so many families.”

President Donald Trump praised the bust in a tweet Thursday, writing: “Our great U.S. Border Patrol Agents made the biggest Fentanyl bust in our Country’s history. Thanks, as always, for a job well done!”

Venezuela opposition leader to police: Leave my family alone

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The Venezuelan opposition leader challenging Nicolas Maduro’s claim to the presidency warned officers from a feared state security unit Thursday to stay away from his family after he accused them of showing up at his apartment in a tense brush with the very force he is trying to persuade to switch allegiance and back him.

A visibly flustered but determined Juan Guaido told a crowd gathered at a university that members of a special police unit known for its brutal tactics had gone to his high-rise apartment in a middle-class neighbourhood of Caracas while his 20-month-old daughter was inside.

“I hold you responsible for anything that might happen to my baby,” the 35-year-old lawmaker said as his wife stood beside him.

He rushed home and emerged an hour later holding his smiling daughter, named for Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan patriot who paved the way for Venezuela’s independence, and described how four agents from the police’s Special Action Force had arrived at the building and asked security guards stationed there for his wife.

“Children are sacred,” he admonished the agents as a crowd of supporters applauded. “Wives are sacred. So don’t cross that red line.”

Trump says State of Union address to stress ‘unity’

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that “unity” will be the theme of his first State of the Union address under divided government and that he respects Stacey Abrams, who will give the Democratic response.

“I hope she does a good job. I respect her,” Trump said of Abrams, who will be the first black woman to deliver the rebuttal.

Trump will give his speech Tuesday before a joint session of Congress at a sensitive time in talks over keeping the government open and funding the border wall he is demanding as part of any deal. Members of Congress are inviting federal workers worried about another shutdown after Feb. 15. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election meddling also hovers.

Trump will also be surrounded by living reminders of the changes wrought by the 2018 midterm elections that ushered Democrats into the House majority.

Sitting behind him: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who manoeuvred the president into retreating last week on his demand for a border wall in exchange for an end to the longest government shutdown in history.

Study: Many small kids in US are using too much toothpaste

NEW YORK (AP) — Too many young kids are using too much toothpaste, increasing their risk of streaky or splotchy teeth when they get older, according to a government survey released Thursday.

About 40 per cent of kids ages 3 to 6 used a brush that was full or half-full of toothpaste, even though experts recommend no more than a pea-sized amount, the study found.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention findings were based on a survey of parents of more than 5,000 kids ages 3 to 15.

Health officials recommend that all people drink fluoridated water, and that everyone 2 or older brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.

But the amount is important. Children under 3 are only supposed to use a smear of toothpaste the size of a grain of rice. Kids 3 to 6 are supposed to keep it to a pea-sized amount.

‘Empire’ actor’s family calls for justice in Chicago attack

CHICAGO (AP) — Jussie Smollett’s family said Thursday that the attack on the black and gay “Empire” actor in downtown Chicago this week was a “hate crime” and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn’t spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett’s family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked “racial and homophobic hate crime” and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

They thanked the public “for their prayers” and said the family is “so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.”

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said. “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

Facebook says Apple is restoring a key developer tool

NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook says Apple is restoring its access to a key development tool that the iPhone maker disabled Wednesday.

Late Tuesday, TechCrunch reported that Facebook paid teens and other users who agreed to download an app called Facebook Research. That app could extensively track their phone and web use. Apple said Facebook was abusing the tool , known as a developer enterprise certificate, to distribute the app on iPhones in a way that allowed the social network to sidestep Apple restrictions on data collection.

By revoking the certificate for the iOS software that powers the iPhone and iPad, Apple closed off Facebook’s efforts to sidestep Apple’s app store and its tighter rules on privacy.

Apple did not immediately respond to a message for comment Thursday afternoon. Facebook did not say whether it agreed to any conditions for the certificate restoration.

In an internal memo sent on Wednesday, Facebook told employees it is “working closely” with Apple to reinstate access. It also told workers to install the public versions of apps from the app store. Apps that it said “may not work” included internal versions of Facebook, Workplace, Instagram and the Ride app, which helps workers with transportation. WhatsApp was not affected.

The family of Jussie Smollett—the Empire actor who was hospitalized this week after being subjected to a violent, racist, and homoephobic attack in Chicago—has now issued a statement on his behalf. Posted to the social media account of Smollett’s sister, actress Jurnee Smollett Bell, the note denounces the “racial and homophobic hate crime,” while pledging support for Smollett, describing him as “a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.”

The family’s note also focuses on the fact that the attack against Smollett—which occurred early in the morning last Tuesday—was symptomatic of wider issues facing vulnerable populations throughout America at the present moment :

We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country.

US expected to announce treaty withdrawal as soon as Friday

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is poised to announce Friday that it is withdrawing from a treaty that has been a centerpiece of superpower arms control since the Cold War and whose demise some analysts worry could fuel a new arms race.

An American withdrawal, which has been expected for months, would follow years of unresolved dispute over Russian compliance with the pact, known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty. It was the first arms control measure to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched cruise missiles with a range between 500 kilometres (310 miles) and 5,000 kilometres (3,100 miles). Russia denies that it has been in violation.

U.S. officials also have expressed worry that China, which is not party to the 1987 treaty, is gaining a significant military advantage in Asia by deploying large numbers of missiles with ranges beyond the treaty’s limit. Leaving the INF treaty would allow the Trump administration to counter the Chinese, but it’s unclear how it would do that.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in early December that Washington would give Moscow 60 days to return to compliance before it gave formal notice of withdrawal, with actual withdrawal taking place six months later. The 60-day deadline expires on Saturday, and the administration is expected to say as early as Friday that efforts to work out a compliance deal have failed and that it would suspend its compliance with the treaty’s terms.

The State Department said Pompeo would make a public statement on Friday morning, but it did not mention the topic.

Trump plan would channel prescription discounts to patients

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration Thursday unveiled a plan to channel now-hidden prescription drug rebates directly to patients, saying it would bypass middlemen and lower prices for consumers.

The proposed regulation from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar would eliminate behind-the-scenes discounts among drugmakers, insurers and go-betweens and instead require that they be paid directly to consumers when they buy their medications.

The idea is to do away with a hidden cost seen as contributing to artificially high list prices for prescription drugs. The proposal was co-authored with the Health and Human Services inspector general’s office.

The plan comes as President Donald Trump is under political pressure to deliver results on his repeated promises to slash prescription drug costs. Democrats in Congress want to empower Medicare to directly negotiate prices with drug companies, but Republicans prefer a market-based approach that keeps the government out of setting prices.

The impact for consumers would not be immediate, since the changes would take effect over the next year if all goes according to plan. Also, drugmakers do not currently provide discounts for all their medications.

US border agency says it’s made biggest-ever fentanyl bust

PHOENIX (AP) — U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials announced Thursday their biggest fentanyl bust ever, saying they captured nearly 254 pounds (114 kilograms) of the synthetic drug that is fueling a national epidemic of fatal opioid overdoses from a secret compartment inside a load of Mexican produce heading into Arizona.

The drug was found hidden Saturday morning in a compartment under the rear floor of a tractor-trailer after a scan during a secondary inspection indicated “some anomalies” in the load, and the agency’s police dog team alerted officers to the presence of drugs, Nogales CBP Port Director Michael Humphries said.

Most of the seized fentanyl with an overall street value of about $3.5 million was in white powder form, but about 2 pounds of it (1 kilogram) was contained in pills. Agents also seized nearly 395 pounds (179 kilograms) of methamphetamine with a street value of $1.18 million, Humphries said.

“The size of a few grains of salt of fentanyl, which is a dangerous opioid, can kill a person very quickly,” Humphries said. The seizure, he said, had prevented an immeasurable number of doses of the drug “that could have harmed so many families.”

President Donald Trump praised the bust in a tweet Thursday, writing: “Our great U.S. Border Patrol Agents made the biggest Fentanyl bust in our Country’s history. Thanks, as always, for a job well done!”

Venezuela opposition leader to police: Leave my family alone

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The Venezuelan opposition leader challenging Nicolas Maduro’s claim to the presidency warned officers from a feared state security unit Thursday to stay away from his family after he accused them of showing up at his apartment in a tense brush with the very force he is trying to persuade to switch allegiance and back him.

A visibly flustered but determined Juan Guaido told a crowd gathered at a university that members of a special police unit known for its brutal tactics had gone to his high-rise apartment in a middle-class neighbourhood of Caracas while his 20-month-old daughter was inside.

“I hold you responsible for anything that might happen to my baby,” the 35-year-old lawmaker said as his wife stood beside him.

He rushed home and emerged an hour later holding his smiling daughter, named for Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan patriot who paved the way for Venezuela’s independence, and described how four agents from the police’s Special Action Force had arrived at the building and asked security guards stationed there for his wife.

“Children are sacred,” he admonished the agents as a crowd of supporters applauded. “Wives are sacred. So don’t cross that red line.”

Trump says State of Union address to stress ‘unity’

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that “unity” will be the theme of his first State of the Union address under divided government and that he respects Stacey Abrams, who will give the Democratic response.

“I hope she does a good job. I respect her,” Trump said of Abrams, who will be the first black woman to deliver the rebuttal.

Trump will give his speech Tuesday before a joint session of Congress at a sensitive time in talks over keeping the government open and funding the border wall he is demanding as part of any deal. Members of Congress are inviting federal workers worried about another shutdown after Feb. 15. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election meddling also hovers.

Trump will also be surrounded by living reminders of the changes wrought by the 2018 midterm elections that ushered Democrats into the House majority.

Sitting behind him: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who manoeuvred the president into retreating last week on his demand for a border wall in exchange for an end to the longest government shutdown in history.

Study: Many small kids in US are using too much toothpaste

NEW YORK (AP) — Too many young kids are using too much toothpaste, increasing their risk of streaky or splotchy teeth when they get older, according to a government survey released Thursday.

About 40 per cent of kids ages 3 to 6 used a brush that was full or half-full of toothpaste, even though experts recommend no more than a pea-sized amount, the study found.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention findings were based on a survey of parents of more than 5,000 kids ages 3 to 15.

Health officials recommend that all people drink fluoridated water, and that everyone 2 or older brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.

But the amount is important. Children under 3 are only supposed to use a smear of toothpaste the size of a grain of rice. Kids 3 to 6 are supposed to keep it to a pea-sized amount.

‘Empire’ actor’s family calls for justice in Chicago attack

CHICAGO (AP) — Jussie Smollett’s family said Thursday that the attack on the black and gay “Empire” actor in downtown Chicago this week was a “hate crime” and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn’t spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett’s family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked “racial and homophobic hate crime” and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

They thanked the public “for their prayers” and said the family is “so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.”

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said. “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

Facebook says Apple is restoring a key developer tool

NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook says Apple is restoring its access to a key development tool that the iPhone maker disabled Wednesday.

Late Tuesday, TechCrunch reported that Facebook paid teens and other users who agreed to download an app called Facebook Research. That app could extensively track their phone and web use. Apple said Facebook was abusing the tool , known as a developer enterprise certificate, to distribute the app on iPhones in a way that allowed the social network to sidestep Apple restrictions on data collection.

By revoking the certificate for the iOS software that powers the iPhone and iPad, Apple closed off Facebook’s efforts to sidestep Apple’s app store and its tighter rules on privacy.

Apple did not immediately respond to a message for comment Thursday afternoon. Facebook did not say whether it agreed to any conditions for the certificate restoration.

In an internal memo sent on Wednesday, Facebook told employees it is “working closely” with Apple to reinstate access. It also told workers to install the public versions of apps from the app store. Apps that it said “may not work” included internal versions of Facebook, Workplace, Instagram and the Ride app, which helps workers with transportation. WhatsApp was not affected.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared Thursday that there’ll be no “wall money” in any compromise border security deal as she and President Donald Trump signalled that congressional negotiators may never satisfy his demands for his cherished Southwest border proposal.

Trump, who in recent weeks has expressed indifference to whether the term “wall” or something else is used, clung with renewed tenacity to the word that became his campaign mantra, declaring, “A wall is a wall.” Yet in a series of tweets and statements, he issued conflicting messages about what he’d need to declare victory and suggested that merely repairing existing structures along the boundary could be a major component of a triumph.

Amid signs that Trump’s leverage in Congress is atrophying, he seemed to aim one tweet at his conservative followers. He wrote that Democrats “are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I’ve got you covered. Wall is already being built, I don’t expect much help!”

Pelosi, D-Calif., left the door open for an accord that could finance some barriers, citing what she said was already existing “Normandy fencing” that blocks vehicles.

“If the president wants to call that a wall, he can call that a wall,” she told reporters. She added: “Is there a place for enhanced fencing? Normandy fencing would work.”

Long johns to short sleeves: Rapid thaw follows polar blast

CHICAGO (AP) — In Illinois, temperatures could rise by 80 degrees within days. In Michigan, melting snow and rain and a 17-mile ice jam could lead to flooding. Across the Midwest, the sudden warmth was sure to bring more broken roads and busted water mains.

The polar vortex that brought many cities to a standstill was expected to end with a rapid thaw that experts say could be unprecedented. But the sudden swing from long johns to light jackets and short sleeves could create problems of its own.

“I don’t think there’s ever been a case where we’ve seen (such a big) shift in temperatures,” in the winter, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the Weather Underground firm. “Past record-cold waves have not dissipated this quickly. … Here we are going right into spring-like temperatures.”

On Thursday, the system marched east, spreading arctic conditions over an area from Buffalo to Brooklyn. In western New York, a storm that dumped up to 20 inches of snow (51 centimetres) gave way to subzero temperatures and face-stinging wind chills. In New York City, about 200 firefighters battling a blaze in a commercial building took turns getting warm on buses. The number of deaths that could be blamed on the cold climbed to at least 15.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration is pulling the plug on a decades-old nuclear arms treaty with Russia, lifting what it sees as unreasonable constraints on competing with a resurgent Russia and a more assertive China. The move announced Friday sets the stage for delicate talks with U.S. allies over potential new American missile deployments.

In explaining his decision, which he had foreshadowed months ago, President Donald Trump accused Moscow of violating the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty with ""impunity"" by deploying banned missiles. Moscow denies it is in violation and has accused Washington of resisting its efforts to resolve the dispute.

Democrats in Congress and some arms control advocates criticized Trump's decision as opening the door to an arms race.

""The U.S. threat to terminate the treaty will not bring Russia back into compliance and could unleash a dangerous and costly new missile competition between the United States and Russia in Europe and beyond,"" the private Arms Control Association said. It argued that Washington had not exhausted options for drawing Russia back into compliance.

Trump said in a statement that the U.S. will ""move forward"" with developing its own military response options to Russia's banned deployment of cruise missiles that could target western Europe.

Foxconn again shifts Wisconsin plan after Trump intervenes

MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Foxconn Technology Group has shifted its stated strategy yet again on Friday for a massive Wisconsin campus, crediting a conversation with President Donald Trump for cementing plans to proceed with building a factory to make high-tech liquid display screens.

The news capped a week of confusion about Foxconn's plans in Wisconsin. The company announced in 2017, to much fanfare, that it planned to invest $10 billion in the state and hire 13,000 people to build an LCD factory that could make screens for televisions and a variety of other devices.

The company last year said it was reducing the scale of what was to be made in Wisconsin, from what is known as a Gen 10 factory to Gen 6. But this week, even that was thrown into question with Foxconn executive Louis Woo said it couldn't compete in the television screen market and would not be making LCD panels in Wisconsin.

But on Friday, in yet another twist, Foxconn said after discussions with the White House and a personal conversation between Trump and Foxconn chairman Terry Gou, it plans to proceed with the smaller manufacturing facility.

""Great news on Foxconn in Wisconsin after my conversation with Terry Gou!"" Trump tweeted.

'Love ain't easy': Booker brings upbeat vibe to 2020 fight

WASHINGTON (AP) - Cory Booker leapt into the 2020 presidential race on Friday with a call for Americans to unite in a time of bitter polarization while some of his Democratic rivals are taking a more combative stance as they vie to take on President Donald Trump.

Booker's entry into the Democratic primary was steeped in history and symbolism, befitting his status as the second black candidate in a historically diverse field. Invoking the legacy of the national movements for civil rights and for women's suffrage, the New Jersey senator urged a return to a ""common sense of purpose"" and cast his appeal to the nation's better angels as an uplifting alternative to Trump.

The 49-year-old Booker told reporters outside his home in Newark that ""love ain't easy,"" adding: ""The people I admire are the people that lead by calling out the best of who we are and not the worst. So, I'm running for president because I believe in us. I believe in these values.""

Whether Democrats are in the mood to embrace Booker's optimistic persona after two years of fuming about Trump's presidency remains to be seen. With Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren running as a champion for the middle class in a fight against powerful interests, and California Sen. Kamala running on taking on Trump directly, Booker's fate may hinge on a bet that the electorate will respond again to the soaring oratory that helped Barack Obama break through in 2008.

Known for his easy way with voters during an age of selfies and social media, Booker, the former mayor of Newark, announced his bid with a video that showcased his personal ties to the ""low-income, inner city community"" he says he led to a comeback. Booker won a special Senate election in 2013 and then a full Senate term in 2014.

Human toll of cold: more than 2 dozen dead, hundreds hurt

CHICAGO (AP) - The dangerous cold and heavy snow that hobbled the northern U.S. this week has retreated, but not before exacting a human toll: more than two dozen weather-related deaths in eight states and hundreds of injuries, including frostbite, broken bones, heart attacks and carbon monoxide poisoning.

In Illinois alone, hospitals reported more than 220 cases of frostbite and hypothermia since Tuesday, when the polar vortex moved in and overnight temperatures plunged to minus 30 (minus 34 Celsius) or lower - with wind chills of minus 50 (minus 45 Celsius) or worse in some areas.

Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis normally sees around 30 frostbite patients in an entire winter. It admitted 28 in the past week, spokeswoman Christine Hill said Friday.

""I definitely saw more frostbite than I've ever seen in my entire career just in the last three days,"" said Dr. Andrea Rowland-Fischer, an emergency department physician at Hennepin Healthcare.

Most of those patients, she said, had underlying problems that made it difficult for them to take care of themselves: the developmentally delayed, the mentally ill, the very young and the very old. They also included people with injuries related to drugs and alcohol - people who passed out or did not realize they were cold or injured.

Young Maduro loyalist is new hope for Venezuela's socialists

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - Amid the political turmoil roiling Venezuela it's easy to overlook this milestone: the 20th anniversary on Saturday of Hugo Chavez's Bolivarian revolution.

On Feb. 2, 1999, Chavez took office with a fiery anti-imperialist rhetoric that would inspire leaders across Latin America and reshape the region's relations with Washington.

But many now wonder how much longer the late leader's political movement - known as Chavismo - can survive with an economy on its knees and the U.S. pushing harder than ever for regime change.

One person refusing to throw in the towel is Hector Rodriguez, the governor of Miranda state and the face of the next generation of the ruling socialist party, whose meteoric rise could be undone by the current crisis.

The 36-year-old was just a teenager when Chavez took power. Now one of the last remaining allies of President Nicolas Maduro who still enjoys a respectable approval rating, Rodriguez is searching, along with other loyalists, for answers to how to rescue the country, and with it, Chavez's increasingly tarnished legacy.

'Empire' actor says account of attack has been consistent

CHICAGO (AP) - ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett said Friday that he has been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation into what he says was a racist and homophobic attack on him in downtown Chicago earlier this week.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home - including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck - they haven't found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

Family made billions on opioid as crisis raged, filing says

BOSTON (AP) - The family behind OxyContin raked in billions of dollars as it pushed to keep patients on the powerful painkiller longer despite evidence that the drug was helping to fuel the nation's deadly opioid crisis, Massachusetts authorities allege in newly public court documents.

While aggressively marketing OxyContin, the Sackler family also sought to profit off the drug abuse crisis its company helped create by exploring selling drugs used to treat addiction and reverse overdoses, state lawyers contend in previously secret parts of their lawsuit against Purdue Pharma.

Attorney General Maura Healey is suing Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma, along with some company executives and members of the wealthy Sackler family, in an effort to hold them accountable for the toll of the state's drug crisis. Massachusetts' is the first state case to personally name members of the Sackler clan, whose name is emblazoned on walls at some of the world's great museums and universities.

Purdue had fought to keep the new allegations secret, but three courts ruled against the company. Its lawyers said after the wholly unredacted complaint was released late Thursday that Massachusetts is trying to ""single out Purdue, blame it for the entire opioid crisis, and try the case in the court of public opinion rather than the justice system.""

Health officials say nearly 48,000 overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2017 involved some type of opioid, including illicit drugs.

Trump's 'America first' mantra will be prominent in address

WASHINGTON (AP) - For all of President Donald Trump's talk about ""America first,"" the next two years of his presidency could shine a sharp spotlight on America abroad.

His State of the Union address next week will be dissected for clues on how he'll deal with a full plate of foreign policy challenges. His words will serve as fodder for ongoing partisan debate about whether his decisions will have passing or long-lasting effects on the world.

Will he pull troops from Afghanistan? Can he coax North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program? What will America's future role be in Syria? What about U.S. power struggles with China, Russia and Iran, instability in the Middle East and U.S. relations with European allies?

""There is so much polarization around this whole discussion of Trump - pro-Trump, anti-Trump - that it's hard to make sweeping declarations about the success or failure of Trump's foreign policy,"" said John Hannah, who has held foreign policy posts in both Democratic and Republican administrations.

""There's been some good and some bad, but also a risk that the president's own unpredictability is undercutting some of his important achievements,"" said Hannah, who is now with the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

Science Says: Internet craze behind a brain-tingling beer ad

A new Super Bowl commercial aims to calm frenzied football fans with oddly relaxing images of actress Zoe Kravitz whispering into a pair of microphones and softly tapping on a bottle.

The beer ad already has drawn more than 10 million views and stands to expose a vast audience to an internet craze known as ASMR, or autonomous sensory meridian response.

Some people spend hours watching videos of hair brushing, paper crinkling or ""happy little clouds"" artist Bob Ross painting because they say it makes their brains tingle. They report feeling a rush from the subtle, repetitive sights and sounds, but is it all in their heads?

Not everyone feels ASMR. And so far, there's not enough evidence to recommend it as a stand-alone treatment for depression, anxiety, insomnia or any of the other problems its fans claim it solves.

But a few scientists are trying to study ASMR, and there is evidence that there might be something to it. And if any harm is done, it's not financial: It's usually free.

Indiana, Kentucky join Planned Parenthood's western alliance

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Planned Parenthood's affiliate overseeing Hawaii and three western states announced Friday that it was adding Indiana and Kentucky, a first-of-its-kind consolidation based not on geography but on reallocating resources to fight new abortion restrictions in the Midwest and South.

The arrangement by the women's health nonprofit places Indiana and Kentucky under a Seattle-based affiliate that currently oversees clinics in Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho and western Washington.

Chris Charbonneau, the CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands, said her group has an annual budget of about $70 million. She said its donors wanted to help Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky.

In recent years, that Indianapolis-based group has faced the legal costs of challenging far-reaching limits on abortion rights sought by Republican lawmakers in both states - including a proposed bill before Kentucky's Legislature that would ban abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.

""They feel like other parts of the country have a tougher row to hoe and they're looking forward to supporting this effect,"" Charbonneau said of the donors. ""... The political environments in Indiana and Kentucky have been particularly oppressive and they've made getting health care to low-income people in the states difficult."""

By Steve Gorman

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The family of television actor Jussie Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hip-hop musical drama ""Empire,"" spoke out on Thursday to condemn the assault he reported suffering in Chicago at the hands of two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

Chicago police said detectives have been unable to obtain cell phone records to ""independently verify"" a key part of Smollett's story - that he was talking with his manager by phone at the time he was accosted.

Smollett, an African-American who is openly gay in real life, has not commented publicly, but his publicist issued a statement attributed to his family that read:

""Our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.""

It added that Smollett had ""told the police everything"" and that ""his story has never changed.""

But NBC News, citing police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, reported Smollett himself had refused to turn over his cell phone or phone records to investigators to confirm the call to his manager.

""Cell phone records were not provided to investigators when asked,"" Guglielmi confirmed in an email to Reuters while declining to clarify who failed to furnish them.

Guglielmi also said police had ""no reason to doubt"" the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack in the early hours of Tuesday.

Late on Wednesday, investigators released a pair of images from surveillance video showing two ""potential persons of interest"" sought for questioning in what police said they are treating as a ""possible hate crime.""

The two figures, seen only in silhouette, are pictured walking together down a dimly lit sidewalk between a snow-covered median strip and the side of a building. Police said footage from additional cameras was being reviewed.

Police accounts say Smollett reported two men approached him on the street shouting racial and homophobic slurs, then struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Smollett took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police said.

The news spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested the story was a hoax. In releasing the surveillance camera images on Twitter, police said detectives ""are taking this development seriously.""

President Donald Trump gave further credence to the incident in remarks to reporters, saying the attack on Smollett was ""horrible"" and ""doesn't get worse,"" Variety reported.

""Empire"" debuted on the Fox network in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Jussie Smollett’s family has broken their silence after the Empire star was attacked on Tuesday, January 29.

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violence and unprovoked attack,” the Smollett family said in a statement to Us Weekly on Thursday, January 31. “We want to be clear — this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.”

The family said the actor, 36, has been working closely with authorities since he was hospitalized and “his story has never changed.” The Smolletts added: “We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.”

The family also raised awareness about “targeted hate crimes” that happen far too often in society. “These are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such,” they said. “They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall.”

The statement concluded on a powerful note: “We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed to Us on Tuesday that Smollett was hospitalized after he was attacked by two people while they yelled “racial and homophobic slurs toward him.”

“The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.” Guglielmi added. “At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

On Wednesday, January 30, the Chicago Police Department identified “potential persons of interest wanted for questioning in reference to” the attack. Smollett has yet to speak publicly about what happened, but he has received tons of support from fans, friends and fellow celebrities."

Being the new face of Balmain came with a campaign from Cara Delevingne that features an iconic look from Janet Jackson.

Delevingne and Balmain creative director Oliver Rousteing posed with him standing behind Delevingne with his hands over her breasts. This is a classic look back ad the 1993 Rolling Stone cover which featured a then 24-year-old Janet.

“It references all the iconic album covers of the 90s, which were big pop-culture moments of our childhood,” Rousteing told WWD. “Choosing to pose naked was all about authenticity. We’re going back to basics: I wanted something pure and transparent.”

This is the second time that Delevingne has stared in a campaign for Balmain as she posed for their 2014 collection with models Jordan Dunn and Binx Walton.

While being nude isn’t ideal for a fashion campaign, Rousteing said that he wanted Delevingne’s modeling skills to

“do the talking.” “I love her so much that I don’t want to see any clothes on her,” he said. ”Her gaze is so strong and magnetic, it’s nearly an item of clothing in itself.”

“He didn’t fall out,” Anaheim police Sgt. Daron Wyatt said (via the Orange County Register). “He had to maneuver himself around the safety mechanism.”

The man, who has cognitive disabilities, climbed out of the vehicle while it was in the middle of the initial climb. The ride was stopped when operators realized the man was missing. He was found unharmed and uninjured. No police report was filed."

Following the racist, homophobic attack on the “Empire” star, Hart took to his social media to show solidarity with Smollett. And people quickly reminded him of how he used homophobic language in his jokes, how he refused to apologize for it.

Rather than back down, Hart took to Twitter to confront those challenging the sincerity of his condolences. “I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person. Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do…CHANGE!” Hart wrote.

The host argued that not only are Donald Trump‘s policies the hats symbolize not racist, they are to the benefit and inclusion of minorities, telling viewers to keep wearing the hats and show what “true tolerance” looks like.

Ingraham began the segment by showing clips from other networks and political figures, saying that “it’s now gotten so bad in America that wearing a Trump hat is basically considered a hate crime.”

The host went through several other prominent recent stories, including comments by Tom Brokaw, the alleged attack on actor Jussie Smollett, and the debacle over the Covington Catholic school students (full clip below), saying that “the goal” of Democrats and the media is “to brand an entire belief system as immoral, evil, toxic, and of course it’s racist.”

Ingraham argued that “by any objective analysis, Donald Trump’s policies are working. And they’re not scary, and they’e not racist, and they’re not anti-woman, and they’re not anti-immigrant.”

“Not only is this conservative agenda working,” she claimed, “it’s working really well for minorities.”

She said that the resistance doesn’t care about those successes and want people to be “angry and resentful” instead. Republicans should “actively engage in minority communities” and not “be bullied out of them,” she said, and the President and his cabinet should “travel to cities like Oakland and Chicago and Baltimore, not just to safe Zones in red states” and meet with people and listen to them. She then closed with advice regarding the MAGA hats.

“As for those red hats? Well I would continue to wear them whenever and wherever you like,” said Ingraham. “And when doing so, be sure to show everyone around you what true tolerance, kindness, and inclusiveness looks like.”

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett (pictured above right) accused two unknown Trump supporters of attacking him in Chicago in the wee hours of Tuesday morning.

Smollett, who is gay and African-American, claimed the attackers made homophobic and racist remarks to him.

Smollett alleged the men tried to throw a noose around his neck and yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

These hate-crime allegations horrified Americans.

Authorities are investigating the allegations, but so far they have found no video evidence of the attack itself on nearby surveillance cameras. Other questions arose after more details emerged.

“In the initial reports there was no mention of MAGA,” police said in a statement to People. “When detectives [followed] up with [Smollett] later in the day, he recalled the offenders making those comments and detectives completed a supplemental report.”

President Donald Trump condemned the alleged hate-crime attack on Thursday, saying at the White House, “That I can tell you is horrible. I’ve seen it. It doesn’t get worse.”

But it didn’t take long for many liberals and media members to blame the president and lump all of his supporters together as racists.

MORE NEWS: Special Guest JeRon Smith, Deputy Assistant To President Trump

The same thing happened when media members and Democrats gave Native-American activist Nathan Phillips the benefit of the doubt after a video went viral showing his confrontation with Trump supporters.

The video showed an encounter between Phillips and MAGA hat-wearing teens from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky — specifically, Nick Sandmann. The incident occurred after the March for Life rally in Washington, D.C., near the Lincoln Memorial.

People on social media at first targeted Sandmann and the other kids, accusing them of racism and assuming they’d approached and surrounded Phillips to mock him. But far more complete videos showed otherwise. Instead, it was Phillips who approached the teenagers while beating a drum and chanting. He got right up in Sandmann’s face and continued chanting for some time. Sandmann merely stood there.

Yet the damage was done — and as a result of messages spread by many in the media and others, the Covington teens received death threats and torrents of verbal abuse on social media targeting their faith, their political affiliation, and their families. Their school received bomb threats and their families were targeted.

“It’s now gotten so bad in America that wearing a Trump hat is basically considered a hate crime,” Ingraham said.

“The goal, my friends, is to brand an entire belief system as immoral, evil, toxic and of course it’s racist,” Ingraham added. “Liberals who used to love discourse … they now prefer the easier route: Just call someone a Nazi or a closet KKK member and you’re done.”

“This is the same hatred, of course, that we saw hurled at those Covington Catholic High School boys,” Ingraham noted. “Like lightning, the media instantly branded them as MAGA-hatted racists, products of an evil religious education who dared to disrespect this Native-American protester. Only later did we learn that it was the kids who had been harassed and confronted by adults.”

Now there’s a “new MAGA incidence” brewing with the Smollett allegations. And again, “the media is rushing in to judgment” without all of the facts and evidence, Ingraham said.

“It is irresponsible and frankly unjust to tar all Trump supporters as racists and haters because you disagree with the president or because some nut-bag did something hateful and awful,” Ingraham warned. “This destructive racial narrative has infected our political life.”

Ingraham asked Project 21 Chairman Horace Cooper why “the resistance” is using a “broad racism brush” applied “so generously to Trump and his supporters.

Cooper replied, “Because it’s effective. It is a very good way to stop people from being able to see how important the policies are, how effective they are, how impactful they are. It is working, and it will keep continuing to occur unless we can call these people out for doing it.”

Liberals and media members are “scouring the news to find little episodes that they can show to create a counter-narrative that’s false,” Cooper argued.

Former Georgia state Rep. Dee Dawkins-Haigler (D) said she doesn’t believe “all Trump supporters are racists.”

“But I do think some racists are Trump supporters,” Dawkins-Haigler added. “And so what we need to do is make sure that we have civil conversations in this country. Because to be honest with you, I kind of like the criminal justice reform” that Trump supported and signed into law, she said.

“But [Trump’s] rhetoric throughout the campaign trail to even now — it turns people off and it has certain bases all worked up,” Dawkins-Haigler said.

The Fox News host urged Republicans to do the following: “Don’t play defense. Don’t apologize for your beliefs. Actively engage in minority communities. Don’t be bullied out of them. Listen to the concerns of the people — even when it’s uncomfortable.

Bruce LeVell, a Trump campaign diversity adviser, told Ingraham that “the Left has always been using the race card — as I call [it], the real voter suppression — to intimidate brown folks like me across the country to keep us from looking at” conservative ideas.

Ingraham said liberals want minority Americans “to be angry and resentful.”

The Fox News host urged Republicans to do the following: “Don’t play defense. Don’t apologize for your beliefs. Actively engage in minority communities. Don’t be bullied out of them. Listen to the concerns of the people — even when it’s uncomfortable, and it will be. Explain your policies without the filter of an unfriendly media.”

“And as for those red hats, well, I’d continue to wear them whenever and wherever you like. And when doing so, be sure to show everyone around you what true tolerance, kindness and inclusiveness looks like,” Ingraham said.

Early Monday morning, Empire star Jussie Smollett was allegedly attacked by two mas ked wh ite men in Chicago who beat and berated the 36-year-old actor while yelling racist and homophobic slurs and putting his head in a noose, pouring an unknown chemical on him before fleeing on foot. Smollett, who told police the two men yelled “this is MA GA country,” was transported to a nearby hospital.

After the initial release of a curiously worded statement, Chicago Police, who announced the investigation of the attack as a hate crime, identified two “persons of interest” while issuing a community alert featuring photos of two men walking away from an overhead security camera.

In the days since the attack near his home, Smollett has been the recipient of an outpouring of love from industry peers and and public servants alike. While social media users, celebrities and politicians have taken the time to decry the actions of the two suspects, (and, in the case of Rep. Maxine Waters, the president that emboldens them) media outlets have taken the path of least intellectual honesty in their descriptions of the racist, homophobic attack as “racially charged’ and possibly homophobic.

Thursday, Smollett’s family issued their first statement since the public learned of the attack against their loved one. In it, they took the time to condemn the act, along with the media’s rush to cowardice.

“To be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,”the family wrote. The statement also implored citizens to combat racism and homophobia wherever they see it, while highlighting the fear of random physical violence among members of the LGBTQ+ community and people of color alike.

She continued by describing the man saying he was Caucasian with a beard wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood and blue jeans that were too short, exposing “thick, grey hunting socks” with camel-colored dress shoes. She also noticed he had a rope like item hanging from his sweatshirt.

As we reported, the Empire star’s concert at the Troubadour is still on despite his alleged attack, where two white men fractured one of his ribs, put a noose around his neck, poured a substance believed to be bleach on him, and yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

According to TMZ, the 35-year-old landed in L.A. on Thursday, merely two days after being discharged from the hospital.

The actor — who is reportedly still sporting scars and swelling — not only still plans to go on, he will most likely discuss issues such as homophobia, racism, and America under President Donald Trump while on stage.

Though tickets for the intimate venue — which has a capacity of 400 — were available on Tuesday but quickly sold out. However, because of the media attention surrounding the concert, tickets which sold for $20-$35 each are being resold for TWICE that amount or even more.

As we wrote on Wednesday, Chicago PD released a screen grab from surveillance footage that shows two persons of interest in the area at the time of the alleged incident.

""We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" the statement said in part. ""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""

According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, Smollett was beaten by two men who approached him by yelling out ""racial and homophobic slurs"" at approximately 2 a.m. on Tuesday morning (approx. 7pm on Wednesday evening). They proceeded to assault Smollett and ""poured an unknown chemical substance"" on him.

The two men are also said to have put a rope around Smollett's neck before fleeing on foot. Smollett then transported himself to a nearby hospital.

An investigation into an attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett is producing few clues.

The attack was heinous and unconscionable.

Early on the morning of Tuesday on the 300 block of East North Water Street in Chicago, Empire actor Jussie Smollett was brutally attacked. According to the actor, two individuals approached Smollett and quickly attacked, screaming ‘MAGA’ and spilling bleach on him.

The attack appeared to be a premeditated hate crime. One attacker had a rope tied in the fashion of a noose, and tightened it around Smollett’s neck. The actor was apparently grabbing a bite to eat at Subway, and returning to his apartment when the incident occurred.

Smollett is openly-gay, African-American, and an ardent supporter of LGBTQ rights.

“This is MAGA country!” one of the attackers purportedly screamed, referring to the Trump campaign slogan, ‘Make America Great Again’. Before the attack, the pair also identified the Empire actor by name, and called him the n-word.

Smollett and his manager say they were on the phone while the incident occurred.

After the assault, the attackers quickly ran away, while Smollett hobbled back to his apartment building. Approximately forty minutes later, police responded with body cameras. The noose was loosened but still around his neck.

The crime was met with horror, and quickly sparked an investigation by Chicago PD detectives.

A number of high-profile celebrities and politicians quickly denounced the action. In short order, a serious investigation into a hate crime was initiated.

Representative Bobby Rush, D-Ill., called for an immediate investigation by the FBI. Donald Trump quickly described the action “horrible… it doesn’t get any worse.”

“I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now,” wrote Empire co-star Taraji P. Henson. “@jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone.”

Meanwhile, a massive investigation was launched by the Chicago Police.

But despite the presence of multiple cameras and roughly a dozen investigators, little has been found on film. The only image released, above, shows two dark figures lumbering down the street.

Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Communications Officer for the Chicago Police, released the image of the shadowy individuals on Twitter. Despite the grainy and non-descript nature of the photo, it looks like the only clue so far.

“Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,” Guglielmi tweeted.

According to the Chicago Tribune, footage from three different cameras were surveilled for hours. But nothing has appeared. “So far, police detectives have used at least three surveillance cameras to piece together what [Guglielmi] called ‘a digital puzzle,’’ tracking the movements of both Smollett and the two persons of interest,” the paper reported.

“Smollett is seen walking in one direction on a street and the two other people are walking the other way,” Guglielmi relayed.

The single published photo has sparked a wave of unanswered questions.

According to Guglielmi, the photo was snapped on New Street near Illinois Street, and taken between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. Smollett says he was attacked approximately 30 minutes later.

It’s difficult to tell if either individual is carrying a weapon, noose, or container of bleach.

Smollett reported that he was on the phone with his manager, who reported hearing ‘MAGA’ chants and a scuffle. But both individuals refused to hand over their cellphones to police investigators, however.

“Both the victim and his manager have made statements to detectives that they were on the phone with each other,” Guglielmi continued. “We were not able to independently verify that because they did not turn over cell phone records to police when asked.”

Meanwhile, a raft of disconnected details and unanswered questions are starting to surface.

On social media, dozens of commenters — if not hundreds — are openly calling the account a fabrication.

Many pointed to the extremely low, sub-zero temperatures, which would instantly freeze a substance like bleach. Others wondered how the attack was missed by multiple cameras.

Another question is why Smollett’s manager didn’t immediately call 911.

Among the critics is Erykah Badu, who appeared to openly question the account. “Are y’all sure you know the facts before we tare shit up?” Badu tweeted.

Guglielmi says despite the missing pieces, the investigation is being taken very seriously.

“While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.”

But he also noted that an expanded search has produced little more than a grainy image.

“Detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find a video to be able to release a public description of the offenders,” Guglielmi noted. “Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect’s vehicle to be able to share.”

Meanwhile, Smollett’s family has strongly responded, and reiterated that the attack is a hate crime.

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,” the family stated. “Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received.”

More as the investigation continues. The Chicago PD has asked anyone with information to contact 312-747-8380 or tip anonymously details to cpdtip.com."

The unnamed woman said a man she described a “redneck” was drifting around the building about 12:30 AM Tuesday. She said she took her dogs out for a walk and witnessed the man pacing between the parking garage and entrance, the entertainment news outlet reports.

He reportedly “looked out of place” and appeared agitated as he smoked a cigarette, she said. The woman described the man as a white male, “with scruff on his face wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood and blue jeans that were too short, exposing thick, grey hunting socks” with camel-colored dress shoes, the report said. reports.

The man reportedly was wearing a rope or clothesline, which came from the bottom of his sweatshirt. Smollett reportedly was attacked and had a rope wrapped around his neck.

The woman claimed that the man was not alone and was staring at another man about 300 feet away. That man, she said was positioned near the entrance to the building.

She says she hurried back inside her building after five minutes because she got “creeped out” by the man’s presence.

The woman said she woke up around 4 a.m., and learned that Smollett was attacked as she headed to the gym. The concierge, she said, encouraged her to call the police to report what she witnessed and he gave her two phone numbers.

Persons of Interest Sought

It looks like police are finally making progress in tracking down the people responsible for the racist, homophobic attack against Jussie Smollett.

According to TMZ, investigators have captured multiple persons of interest on surveillance video and plan to release photos to the public in an effort to bring them in for questioning.

While they didn’t refer to the individuals as “suspects,” they plan to release the images soon.

The Empire actor and singer was brutally beaten by two men wearing ski masks in Chicago early Tuesday morning. They reportedly doused the openly gay actor with bleach and tied a noose around his neck while shouting “MAGA country.”

According to the reports, Smollett was walking out of Subway when someone yelled “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n*****?” before attacking him.

According to That Grape Juice, Fox Studios received hate mail earlier this month targeted to the 36-year-old actor. Cut out letters from magazines spelled out “You will die black f**.”

It’s funny how suspicious white men don’t get the cops called on them for loitering like Black folks. But let’s hope the nosey neighbor’s account results in an arrest."

HISTORIC LA DINER FINDS NEW RELEVANCE How did Johnnie’s Coffee Shop turn into a gathering for the political left?

Details of the sign of Johnie’s Coffeeshop, featured in countless movies and music videos, is now a registered historic landmark. Photographed on January 24, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. (James Bernal for KPCC)

The foyer of Johnie’s Coffee Shop on Wilshire and Fairfax smells like weed, musk and dog*. A beat-up piano sits next to stacks of flyers from leftist organizations, and the area is guarded, on this particular afternoon, by a brown-and-white canine with a red bandana around his neck who comes jogging up to the door, barking at unknown newcomers.

Inside, the former restaurant is plastered with political signs with slogans like “#CleanDreamAct DACA Strong,” “Healthcare is a Human Right” and “#stopcagingfamilies.” Once a pinnacle of 1950s Googie architecture, Johnie’s took on new life when it played host to a high-profile 2016 event for U.S. Senator and then-presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

But many Angelenos are wondering what the space is being used for now.

“What is happening to the Johnnie’s Coffee shop at Wilshire/Fairfax? Just a Bernie Sanders landmark?” one LAist reader asked.

YOU CAN’T EVER REALLY DELETE A TWEETHoward Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO who has floated an independent run at the White House, deleted a tweet Wednesday in which he praised a column that insulted other 2020 contenders said The Hill.

In the now-deleted tweet, Schultz linked to a piece that called Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) “shrill” and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) “Fauxcahontas,” a reference to her claims of Native American heritage.

MISSIONARY POSITIONS WILL EXCITE RELIGIOUS BASE IN MISSISSIPPI The Methodist church’s debate and embracement over gay marriage could affect Mississippi politicians in election year.

This year Mississippi politicians, including many Methodist politicians, will be running for office as the issues of gay marriage and the ordination of gay ministers play out in the United Methodist Church. While the New Orleans Saints were battling last week in the NFC championship game (i.e. getting hosed) several hundred Mississippi Methodists were meeting at Christ United Methodist Church in Jackson to discuss the explosive issues of gay marriage and the ordination of gay ministers.

According to the United Methodist Church Mississippi Conference web page, there are more than 165,000 Methodists in the state. There are probably more United Methodist politicians in the state than members of any other congregation except perhaps Southern Baptists. It is safe to assume Methodist politicians will be involved in the issue this election year.

HOMOPHOBIC GREEK BISHOP JAILED Greek Bishop Amvrossios has been jailed for anti-gay speech according to the Greek Reporter.

A Greek court has convicted prominent Greek Orthodox Bishop Amvrossios of violating laws against racism and abusing his office over an anti-gay blog posting.Amvrossios, Bishop of Kalavryta and Aigialeia in the southern Peloponnese region, received a seven-month sentence, suspended for three years.

Amvrossios urged readers in his 2015 posting to “spit upon” homosexuals, adding: “They are not human beings, they are rejects of nature.”

The three-judge court in the southern town of Aigio unanimously found against the bishop, who is one of the most conservative in the Greek Orthodox Church of Greece. A lower court had acquitted him, but the case was appealed. Lawyer Kleio Papandoleon, representing a group of citizens seeking legal action against the bishop, hailed Monday’s ruling, saying it set limits to “inflammatory and racist speech.”

Yep, she.

Harris will be one of the few women ever to play college football. She’s received multiple scholarship offers to four-year programs and while she still hasn’t decided among them, she’s set her sights on an even bigger goal: the NFL.

“I first developed an interest in football when I was about four – between four and six years old. People around me – they weren’t too fond of me playing football. They said that I could get hurt a lot easier playing with guys,” she said.

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett’s apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven’t found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett’s walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor was at home and recovering. Smollett’s family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying the actor was the victim of a “racial and homophobic hate crime” and pushing back against any suggestion that he was anything but truthful with the police.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

President Donald Trump expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn’t far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

Police did not release the actor’s name but a statement from Fox, which airs “Empire,” identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime. Smollett is black and openly gay.

According to a police statement, the actor was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an “unknown substance” on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that when officers first came in contact with Smollett, he still had a rope around his neck. While being interviewed by detectives, Guglielmi said Smollett told them that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The police spokesman added that the two men were wearing masks. Investigators have not found any surveillance video or witnesses from which they can put together a description of the offenders, he said.

Smollett was able to take himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was last reported in good condition.

Guglielmi also said the FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago last week.

Jamal Lyon, Smollett’s character, is the gay, middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Tuesday in support of Smollett. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence,” the statement read.

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels also voiced his support for Smollett in an Instagram video.

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” Daniels said. “You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.”

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

“He is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I’ve ever met,” Harris said Tuesday, adding that she’s still learning more details about the incident.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues and he released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

“Empire” is shot in Chicago and a Fox spokeswoman said the program is currently in production.

—EXCLUSIVE: Family of ‘Empire’ star Jussie Smollett issues statement—

“I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heartfelt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person,” Hart tweeted Wednesday.

Just a day before, Hart was blasted by critics who cited his past homophobic tweets as a disqualifier when it came to sending supportive sentiments the Empire star’s way. Hart was called out and criticized with many still angered over his 10-year-old homophobic jokes that have recently dogged him into stepping down as host of the Oscars, PEOPLE reports.

“Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do… CHANGE!” Hart added.

Like many celebrities, Hart took to Instagram to stand with Smollett after he was violently attacked in Chicago.

But it didn’t go over well for Hart who was blasted for his old homophobic jokes that landed him in the middle of controversy. He has apologized several times, and has made several appearances on shows like “Good Morning America” and “Ellen” in which comedian Ellen DeGeneres encouraged him to consider hosting the Oscars. But the internet was far less forgiving and continued to remind him of the jokes, insisting the impact lingered.

Hart, however, said he’s trying to be the change.

Persons of Interest Sought

It looks like police are finally making progress in tracking down the people responsible for the racist, homophobic attack against Smollett.

According to TMZ, investigators have captured multiple persons of interest on surveillance video and plan to release photos to the public in an effort to bring them in for questioning.

While they didn’t refer to the individuals as “suspects,” they plan to release the images soon.

The Empire actor and singer was brutally beaten by two men wearing ski masks in Chicago early Tuesday morning. They reportedly doused the openly gay actor with bleach and tied a noose around his neck while shouting “MAGA country.”

According to the reports, Smollett was walking out of Subway when someone yelled “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n*****?” before attacking him.

According to That Grape Juice, Fox Studios received hate mail earlier this month targeted to the 36-year-old actor. Cut out letters from magazines spelled out “You will die black f**.”"

Two men attacked African American actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago, Illinois, placing a noose around his neck and yelling homophobic and racist slurs.



Smollett, 36, was attacked at around 02:00 on Tuesday, according to reports.



Police are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.



The attackers allegedly beat Smollett and then poured a chemical substance on him, placing the rope around his neck as if they were going to hang him, according to police.



As of 10:00, 29 January, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders, police said in a statement.



“Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect's vehicle to be able to share.” Chicago police added, “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”



Smollett, who is gay, stars on the Fox show Empire as character Jamal Lyon, a singer songwriter who is also gay. The actor said that his attackers screamed 'MAGA country' as they got away, a reference to US President Donald Trump's slogan 'Make American great again'.

On the other hand, most states still lack laws banning discrimination, and bills that would curtail gay rights keep popping up.

The latest State Equality Index, a yearly report of statewide laws and policies that affect LGBT people produced by the Human Rights Campaign and the Equality Federation Institute and released Thursday, revealed a record 17 states (and the District of Columbia) earning a top rating. That’s an increase of four states over last year and more than double the eight states from 2014, the first year the index was published.

Of course, that still leaves 33 states in the other three rankings, with 28 of them in the lowest category, dubbed “High Priority to Achieve Basic Equality.’’

“It’s incredibly important that these states have taken action to make sure LGBTQ people are afforded equal rights under the law in their states, but certainly, it’s concerning that there are still 33 states that are not there,’’ said Cathryn Oakley, the Human Rights Campaign’s state legislative director and senior counsel.

Just as troubling to the campaign, the nation’s largest gay rights organization, is the spate of legislative initiatives that have sprouted since the 2015 Supreme Court decision that guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry.

The index details more than 100 bills it considers anti-LGBT that were introduced across 29 states in 2018. Only two passed.

Oakley also cited measures like Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 2015 and North Carolina’s so-called bathroom bill of 2016 – both seen as infringing on LGBT rights – as either responses or anticipatory moves related to the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling.

On Thursday, the Arkansas state Supreme Court rejected an attempt by the city of Fayetteville to continue enforcing its ordinance banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, saying the measure violates a state law aimed at preventing local protections for LGBT people.

That was viewed as a jurisdictional ruling more than anything else, but Arkansas is one of 30 states that doesn’t provide civil rights protection based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

The Human Rights Campaign is one of the advocacy groups pushing for an Equality Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in areas including employment, housing and public accommodations.

“LGBTQ people still face the sobering reality that their rights are determined by which side of a state or city line they call home,’’ campaign president Chad Griffin said in a statement. “As this year’s State Equality Index makes clear, the time has come for us to do away with this patchwork of state laws and to protect all LGBTQ people by passing the federal Equality Act.’’

Previous attempts at such a law have died in committee, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has committed to making the bill a priority. The California Democrat has public support on her side: A survey published in August by the Public Religion Research Institute showed 71 percent of Americans favor safeguards for the LGBT community.

In addition, the campaign said, more than 130 major companies throughout the country have joined its effort to push for the bill.

But there’s no certainty the Republican-controlled Senate would approve it, and even less that President Donald Trump – who wants to ban transgender people from serving openly in the military – would sign it.

Oakley said the campaign is optimistic about the bill’s prospects this year while recognizing it will be a huge undertaking to get it passed.

“It’s absolutely a big lift, but it should be a big lift,’’ she said. “It’s a major piece of civil rights legislation, and it only makes sense it would take work to pass it. That said, it’s had bipartisan support in the past, and we know we have tremendous support from the American public, and we have a lot of support from the business community.’’

Smollett's family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday and shut down people who suggested that Smollett was anything but honest with the police.

The family said they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked 'racial and homophobic hate crime' and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

'Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,' the family said.

They thanked the public 'for their prayers' and said they are 'so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive'.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2am Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an 'unknown chemical substance' on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a noose still around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

'We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,' the family said.

'Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.'

They said such incidents will continue to happen until people are held accountable.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn't spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home.

Smollett's manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, Guglielmi said.

This image provided by the Chicago Police Department and taken from surveillance video shows two people of interest in an attack on Smollett walking along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

The attack took place here, in the street, outside the apartment building where Smollett stays while he is in Chicago filming. It is in between two luxury apartment buildings and two hotels but police say they have not yet recovered surveillance footage of it

When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck.

Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

The area is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants and has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home, Guglielmi added.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

Smollett and his manager Brandon Z. Moore both told police they were on the phone when the attack happened. Moore said he heard the attackers yell 'this is MAGA country'

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, that appears to be dated from January 18, stating: 'You will die black f*g'. Fox Studio received the letter on the 22nd and cops said it was laced with powder Tylenol

'It's like putting together a puzzle,' he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released.

Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in 'MAGA country,' an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's 'Make America Great Again' slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

'That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,' the president told reporters when asked about the matter.

Jay King, 18, and Judah Norwood,17, said in the lawsuit filed last week against the Pinellas County School District they were also targeted by racial slurs and ‘sexual depravity.’ The suit claims their former teammates at East Lake High School tried to force them to race naked with Oreo cookies wedged between their butt cheeks. And the loser of the ‘Oreo Run’ would have been forced to eat both cookies, the report says. They are seeking $15,000 in damages.

King and Norwood both refused to participate, and as a result, their teammates bullied them and called them the n-word. An assistant coach also used the racist slur, which led them to transfer schools. Norwood ended up stop playing baseball.

Todd Hoover, a lawyer for the students, said there was a ‘lack of adequate supervision’ by the staff.

The district conducted an investigation, but found no evidence of wrongdoing by coaches or administrators.

The lawsuit states that some of the students teammates allegedly exposed themselves while warming up and would often touch each other inappropriately in front of their coaches. The coaches did nothing. The suit does not mention if the two were touched.

“I’m not a liar,” King said confronting the school board about the allegations at a meeting on Tuesday night. “Everything I said is true. Hazing, sexual harassment and bullying did occur.”

King said he heard about hazing on the team before entering his senior year but didn’t believe it, the Tampa Bay Times writes.

“They were telling me about it in the fall, and I thought it was a joke,” King told the news outlet. “I didn’t take it serious until the day actually came up.”

The lawsuit charges that the students and their families suffered mental and emotional stress, including anxiety, depression, insomnia and low self-esteem due to the team’s ‘negligent supervision.’"

Smollett, 35, who stars as Jamal Lyon on Fox's ""Empire,"" is recovering after he was attacked on Tuesday by two unknown men in what was a homophobic and racially-charged incident in Chicago.

The Chicago Police Department said that the television star was walking down a street when he was approached by the men who yelled out racial and homophobic slurs.

Smollett was attacked about the face and the men also poured a chemical substance onto him and tied a rope around his neck.

""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,"" 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.

""This despicable act only shamefully reveals how deeply the diseases of hatred, inequality, racism and discrimination continue to course through our country's veins,"" ""Empire"" star Lady Grace Byers said alongside a photo of herself with Smollett.

""Praying deeply for our brother as he heals and recovers. Fervently awaiting the moment that these vile, despicable cowards and purveyors of hate and evil are brought to a smoldering justice.""

""Your light will continue to shine bright, which is the part these disgusting people fail to realize. I hope you make a speedy recovery and continue to educate, motivate, and inspire millions. Love you big bro,"" ""Empire"" star Serayah said next to a photo of herself standing alongside Smollett.

Steve Harvey offered his support in the form of a video. ""As a black man in this country, I'm down with you. I know a lot of brothers that's down with you. This ain't about sexual preference or nothing. This is about coming to the aid of another brother that has tasted the brutality of hatred, racism, and bigotry. So we down with you Jussie Smollett.""

""Stand with my brother @jussiesmollett sending you light and love. Be strong. We got you,"" Jordan said.

""No matter what's happening around us, @JussieSmollett is ALWAYS quick w/a massive smile & hug. Thats the kind of man he is.

""I've known Jussie since he was 10 years old, and a man of @JussieSmollett's talent, intellect and kindness should be an undisputed blessing to our community. My heart is hurting knowing that he's suffering...and for what? Just for being?"" Berry said.

""The fact his presence on this earth would be perceived as a threat to anyone only shows the magnitude of their fear and confusion. I pray that our country learns to heal, that we may see each other for WHO we are and nothing more. We gotta find the LOVE yawl!"" she continued."

The movies that made the most money in 2018 - such as Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Incredibles 2 - were all directed by men.

That's the norm when it comes to Hollywood's biggest films, according to US campaign group, Time's Up.

They've shared figures which reveal only 4% of the biggest earning films from the past decade have been directed by women.

And now they're calling on Hollywood studios and stars to change that.

Time's Up has launched the #4percentchallenge, and stars Tessa Thompson, Brie Larson and Bryce Dallas Howard are among the names to lend their support.

'Women are hired on experience and men are hired on potential'

Time's Up's campaign to draw attention to this inequality has been welcomed by rising female film talent here in the UK.

""Four percent is a pretty depressing figure, but things like this challenge are absolutely necessary,"" British director Georgia Parris told Radio 1 Newsbeat.

She premiered her first full-length film, Mari, at the BFI Film Festival.

""It's that age-old problem that women are hired on experience and men are hired on potential.

""So if we're not being given the opportunities to gain that experience then how is the problem ever going to change?""

Image copyright Mari poster Image caption Georgia premiered her first full-length movie last year

But she says the success of 2017's Wonder Woman is an early sign that things are starting to change.

""I think there's a sense that women tend to direct sensitive, female-based issue films but these are the ones that tend to cost less money,"" she adds.

""But you look at something like Wonder Woman and that's done hugely well.

""We're starting to see those snippets of women being trusted with bigger budgets.""

'Raw, truthful depiction of women'

Movements like the #4percentchallenge are inspiring confidence in future movie-makers, such as film student and aspiring director Beatrice Sutcliffe.

""We're living in the dark ages when it comes to representation in film and the films that are being made,"" Beatrice tells Newsbeat.

""We need to try and give women more of a spotlight because it's so unequal.""

""I'm passionate about breaking through that.""

Image copyright Beatrice Sutcliffe Image caption Beatrice is curating a women's film festival in London this summer for women's network, Like Minded Females

Alongside a more ""truthful depiction of women,"" Beatrice says she wants to see an end to male-directed films using women's bodies as a punchline.

""I want to see a film where a woman actually has her period and it doesn't stop her,"" she says.

""That's raw, that's real, that's what women are going through. At the end of the day, when a woman is having a period in a film, it tends to be as a comical gag.

""A female director can bring that raw, truthful depiction of women.""

Aim is to help 'all groups thrive'

Time's Up claims movies directed by women are more inclusive for girls and women, female characters over 40 and racial and ethnic groups.

""Women directors also hire other women in key behind-the-camera roles,"" it says in a statement.

""The aim is to humanize production processes so that all groups can thrive at work in safe contexts.""

They're asking actors to commit to working with a female director in the next 18 months.

Already, a number of well known actors have signed up to support the campaign.

A list of supporters on the Time's Up's website includes Amy Schumer, Armie Hammer, Jordan Peele, Jussie Smollett, Reese Witherspoon and Zazie Beetz - among many others.

Efforts have been made in the UK to raise female representation, such as 38% of the films screened at the 2018 BFI Film Festival (a major London event) being directed by women.

Big studios are starting to make changes too

Film studios such as JJ Abrams' Bad Robot, Universal and Disney have also signed up to support the #4percentchallenge, and Disney CEO Bob Iger claims his company is already making big steps toward better female representation in the director's chair.

Skip Twitter post by @RobertIger Many have contacted us about accepting the 4% challenge, but I’m proud to say 40% of @DisneyStudios’ upcoming movie slate is being directed by women and we are striving for more! — Robert Iger (@RobertIger) January 31, 2019 Report

Among comments of support for Disney's stance, some say they just want studios to ""hire the best person for the job,"" regardless of gender.

But Georgia says storytellers need to represent society more than this viewpoint suggests.

""Men can direct beautifully - sensitive and feminine stories as well. But at the end of the day, if we're only ever given one viewpoint, a male viewpoint, that is not representative of the world that we live in,"" she says.

""We just have to have a variation of women telling those stories as well to get a more equal balance.""

Captain Marvel

Disney's next big Marvel movie, Captain Marvel, has two directors - one woman, one man (Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck).

""With Captain Marvel coming, I think it's a really important time for female directors, especially those who want to work in the big mainstream Hollywood stuff to come forward and really fight to do that work,"" says Beatrice.

Many of Disney's biggest franchise films currently in production - such as Avengers: Endgame, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, Star Wars IX and The Lion King are all directed by men.

However, other Disney films such as Marvel films The Eternals and Black Widow and the Mulan remake all have female directors.

Smollett plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on Empire. He alleges two men beat him, hurled racist and homophobic insults, and doused him with an “unknown chemical substance.” The actor reportedly said the suspects then put a rope around his neck before running away.

Smollett returned to his apartment after the alleged incident, and his manager, Brandon Moore, called law enforcement from there about 40 minutes later, according to Chicago Police. His attackers purportedly yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the President Donald Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, according to Moore.

Read the family’s full statement below:

In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.

Smollett has five siblings who have all been involved in the entertainment industry, first acting together in the short-lived 1990s television series On Our Own. His sister Jurnee Smollett-Bell (pictured, right) has also worked regularly in television, with recurring roles on Friday Night Lights and True Blood.

Meanwhile, detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking in downtown Chicago before and after he says he was attacked by two masked men, including video of him arriving home with a rope around his neck. However, they are still searching for footage of the attack itself. The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett’s apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Earlier Thursday, TMZ reported a neighbor of Smollett claimed to have a man who looked like a “redneck” lurking near the entrance to their apartment building roughly 90 minutes before the alleged attack. The neighbor, who told the media outlet she did not want to be identified, claims to have seen the man anxiously pacing between the complex’s entrance and parking garage around 12: 30 a.m. Tuesday. She said the man had had “scruff on his face” and wore a blue winter beanie, a blue sweatshirt and jeans short enough to reveal he was wearing “thick, grey hunting socks.”

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. However, they still have not found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

Jussie Smollett’s family said Thursday that the attack on the black and gay “Empire” actor in downtown Chicago this week was a “hate crime” and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn’t spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett’s family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked “racial and homophobic hate crime” and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett’s manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven’t seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett’s description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

The area is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants and has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett’s walk home, Guglielmi said. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn’t far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hour-long drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

""With love & gratitude, the Smollett Family.""

Actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell, the Empire star's sister, shared an emotional message to her Instagram, alongside a smiling snapshot of herself and her brother, along with their siblings.

""Because there’s a light in him that cannot be dimmed, because we are a family of joyful warriors, we will not let this get the best of us,"" she wrote. ""Although this is a picture from happier times, this is the spirit to which we chose to move forward...they will not steal, our joy.""

The attack occurred on Tuesday morning, a source previously told ET, claiming that Smollett was walking in Chicago when two men started yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, before repeatedly hitting him. According to the source, the men then poured a substance on him believed to be bleach and one of the attackers put a rope around his neck.

On Wednesday night, the Chicago Police Department -- who previously told ET that they were investigating the case as a possible hate crime -- shared photos of persons of interest in the case, taken from a surveillance camera in the area.

A spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department previously told ET that Smollett still had the rope around his neck from the attack when he made contact with officers at 2:42 a.m. on Tuesday. The spokesperson says that Smollett told detectives in a follow-up interview late Tuesday afternoon that his two attackers yelled, “MAGA country” to him during the attack. According to police, the offenders fled the scene.

A source told ET on Tuesday that Smollett -- who has received an outpouring of support from his Empire co-stars, as well as other celebrities -- is ""thankful to be alive.""

“Jussie is surrounded by family and friends and is thankful to be alive,” the source said. “Jussie is a fighter and will come out of this stronger.”

On Thursday, a source told ET that Smollett was gearing up to return to work again. He plans to return to work on Empire when the show picks back up after being on temporary shutdown due to the weather, and is expected to still perform his scheduled set at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on Saturday.

""Jussie is planning to perform a musical show this weekend in L.A. Jussie is strong. He knows that what happened to him is unfortunate, but he’s not going to let it get the best of him,"" the source said. ""He’s a fighter and will push through this, like everything else he has fought through in his life.""

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Jussie walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Jussie told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Jussie on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Jussie's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.
