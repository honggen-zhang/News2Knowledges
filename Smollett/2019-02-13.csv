Spokespeople for the Chicago Police Department (CPD) said surveillance footage of the area has not confirmed the presence of any potential assailants in “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) hats, and they confirmed that the suspicious hot sauce bottle of a bleach-smelling liquid appeared on the scene after police had canvassed the area multiple times.

“The person in question is a victim of a crime currently under investigation by the Chicago Police Department,” police officer Michael Carroll told PJ Media.

Last week, Fox 32 Chicago anchor Rafer Weigel tweeted, “[Chicago Police Superintendent] Eddie Johnson says [Jussie Smollett] is still being treated as the victim in this case but if the investigation does reveal he made a false report he will be held accountable.”

#ChicagoPolice Supt Eddie Johnson says #JussieSmollett is still being treated as the victim in this case but if the investigation does reveal he made a false report he will be held accountable. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 5, 2019

Earlier this week, CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that the redacted phone records Smollett turned over to police “do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” ABC7 Chicago reported. Even so, it appears police have not discovered conclusive evidence that Smollett was lying.

Smollett claimed that on January 29, attackers wearing MAGA hats had screamed “This is MAGA country!” before seizing him, putting a noose around his neck, and pouring an unknown bleach-smelling liquid on him.

This week, The New York Post discovered a suspicious hot sauce bottle with bleach-smelling liquid that may have been planted at the scene to corroborate Smollett’s story, which might be a hoax.

PJ Media asked CPD if there were any bottles of bleach-smelling liquid discovered by police n the original report of the scene. CPD officer Michael Carroll said, “No.”

When asked about the hot sauce bottle of bleach-smelling liquid, Carroll said it was “correct” to say it was not at the scene at the time of the original police investigation. “It is unclear if that bottle is related to the incident as it was not discovered during any of the earlier canvases, but we took it for analysis,” he said.

The spokesman also described the evidence to corroborate Jussie Smollett’s claims. “We have collected physical evidence related to this incident, including rope, clothing from the victim, as well as video from numerous closed-circuit cameras in the surrounding area,” Carroll said.

The Chicago Police Department spokesman added, “Recovered video has not depicted any confrontation with the victim.”

PJ Media asked about the footage, specifically whether or not it depicts men in MAGA hats. “That is not confirmed at this time,” PO Michelle Tannehill said.

As more evidence comes to light, it seems more and more likely Jussie Smollett’s story is a hoax. The lack of video confirmation of the altercation is suspicious. The lack of footage showing MAGA hat-wearing assailants is suspicious. The appearance — after multiple police canvases — of the hot sauce bottle is suspicious. Jussie Smollett’s redactions of his phone records are also suspicious.

It remains possible Smollett is telling the truth, but it seems increasingly likely this is a hoax. As of right now, the Chicago Police Department has not decided to change its view of Jussie Smollett as the victim. But this story is far from over.

“Empire’s” Jussie Smollett said he is “p**** off” at people who don’t believe that he was the victims of a racial and homophobic attack.

As we reported, Jussie filed a police reported that he was savagely attacked, a noose was put around his neck, while racial and homophobic slurs were thrown at him.

The 36-year-old actor sat down with ABC’s “Good Morning America” where he expressed that he is angry about the attack and at people who do not believe his account.

“It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ’cause it’s the truth,” Smollett said. “Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.'” “And then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth,'” Smollett said.

Social media began to doubt Smollett’s claims after police said they were not able to find footage of the alleged attack and that he refused to hand over his cell phone records.

The full interview will be aired at a later date.

""I'm pissed off,"" Smollett said, according to an excerpt of the interview, which will air on Thursday. ""It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks.""

The Empire actor told Roberts that he was frustrated, not only by the attack that happened in late January but also by those who said they didn't believe him.

""Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it because it's the truth,"" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It's the truth."" At one point, Smollett choked up when Roberts asked if he feared for his life when he was attacked.

The African-American actor, who is openly gay, was walking in Chicago when someone allegedly hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, according to a statement from the Chicago Police Department. Police said two men allegedly attacked the Empire actor by throwing ""an unknown chemical substance"" at the actor and attempting to tie a rope around Smollett's throat. The Chicago PD also noted that it was investigating the attack as a ""possible hate crime.""

ABC News reported that Smollett also informed the police that his alleged attackers yelled ""MAGA Country"" at him in a reference to President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. The actor's music manager, who was reportedly on the phone with Smollett at the time, told Variety he ""clearly"" heard the same words.

Although Smollett gave his phone records to the Chicago Police Department to confirm that he was on the phone with his music manager before the attack, authorities said the content was too redacted to provide any substantial information for the case.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi stated, ""We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation. However, the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation."" The New York Times reported that Smollett's representatives claimed the actor redacted information to protect the ""privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.""

In addition to many in the entertainment industry and beyond expressing solidarity with him and denouncing the attack, Smollett's family has also been vocally supportive. Two days after the attack, his family released a statement, slamming the ""violent and unprovoked"" incident on Smollett. They called him a ""warrior who light cannot be dimmed"" and said the attack on him was a ""racial and homophobic hate crime.""

""Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable,"" Smollett's family said in the statement. ""Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall."""

Jussie Smollett has said he is ‘pissed off’ at people still not believing his account of what happened when he was attacked by two masked men in Chicago.

The Empire star, 36, has given his first TV interview since the attack, which is set to air on Good Morning America on Thursday, and has vented his frustration at those doubting he is telling the truth.

According to The Independent, he says: ‘I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks.’

TMZ states the men in question ‘beat Jussie up, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him’, before screaming: ‘This is MAGA country’ and running away.

The attack is now being treated as a ‘hate crime’ as the attackers allegedly hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor.

Jussie, who was reportedly ‘reluctant’ at first to report the attack, has had to face criticism on social media that details of his ordeal have been ‘fabricated’.

Sharing his frustration in his new interview, Jussie says: ‘You know, at first it was a thing of, “Listen if I tell the truth, then that’s it, because it’s the truth,” then it became a thing of, like, “Oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth.”

‘And then it became a thing of, like, “Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.”‘

At the beginning of February, Jussie said he believes ‘justice will be served’ and that he is determined to ‘lead with love’.

‘As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,’ he told Essence.

‘Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.’

Jussie has since returned to the public eye and performed his first concert since being attacked in West Hollywood earlier this month.

He made an emotional appearance and told the crowd that he wasn’t going to let his attackers win.

Arriving on-stage to much applause, Jussie stated: ‘I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the motherfuckers win.

He ended his show by telling the audience: ‘We are proud. We are gay.’

In a preview clip of what will air Thursday on “Good Morning America,” Smollett says the aftermath of the attack, which police are investigating as a possible hate crime, has left him feeling “pissed off.”

Prompted by Roberts to elaborate, he said some of his anger is toward his alleged attackers but also those who have cast doubt on his story.

“It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, because it’s the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth,'” he said.

Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” Smollett said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

The 36-year-old “Empire” actor and musician identifies as gay and plays a gay character on the series.

Smollett and his manager, Brandon Moore, told authorities they were speaking on the phone with each other at the time of the attack, Chicago police said.

On Monday, police said it received “limited and redacted phone records” from Smollett and were planning to analyze them.

“Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police,” a spokesperson for Smollett said in a statement Tuesday. “Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” Smollett’s rep added.

Smollett made his first public appearance and performance since the attack on February 2.

During his concert at the Troubadour club in West Hollywood, Smollett told fans that he was “not fully healed yet.”

He said his ribs were bruised during the attack and while he did immediately see a physician, he was not hospitalized.

After the attack, Smollett released a statement saying his body was “strong but my soul is stronger.” He also nodded to the doubts some have cast on his account.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett added. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett’s family also issued a statement, condemning the attack, calling it a “racial and homophobic hate crime.”

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning,” the statement read. “His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

Chicago police have released photos of persons who they believe could have information about the attack and have asked for the public’s help in identifying who they are."

Just your daily reminder that people are vile: a Florida woman threatened to burn a black police officer’s family after he arrested her for drunk driving.

According to the police report obtained by BuzzFeed News, Julie Edwards (above) went on a racist and violent tirade against Volusia County Sheriff’s Office deputy Brandon King once she was inside his cruiser, telling him that her “KKK friends will burn your family” and that “n****** should’ve never been let out of slavery.”

Responding to a disturbance report last Friday, King arrived at a DeLand house to find the 53-year-old trying to leave the property in her vehicle. After smelling alcohol on her breath and noticing that she was slurring, King asked Edwards to take a breathalyzer test — which she refused.

Edwards was reportedly cuffed for refusing to take the test, then tried to walk away from the officer, and resisted his attempts to get her inside his police car.

When she was finally in the car and King was filing the paperwork for her arrest, Edwards apparently began her racist rant, saying that “my KKK people will [find you].” She can be heard saying in the released police footage (below):

“They know people like you. Hey, ain’t a damn thing wrong with burning a cross in your yard, is there? … You f**ked with the wrong white people.”

Edwards was later heard telling the officer that his “eyes will be poked out” and that the “KKK got your ass, boy,” adding:

“My KKK friends will burn your family. You should never be here in the first place. You ever been whipped on a whipping post?”

The report states that King took the woman’s threats to be serious, as he did not know what she was capable of.

The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office released edited footage from the incident on Tuesday, writing in a tweet, “Before you go on a racist rant, just remember we have body cams”:

Edwards is facing charges of making threats against a law enforcement officer, resisting an officer without violence, DUI, and prior refusal to submit to testing. She bonded out of Volusia County Jail and is currently not in custody.

She was previously arrested twice in 2011 on charges including DUI, resisting arrest with violence, battery on a law enforcement officer, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and domestic battery.

In a brief promo for the interview, Smollett is seen tearing up after Roberts asks him if he feared for his life at any point during the attack.

The 36-year-old Smollett claims he was attacked around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 after leaving a Subway restaurant in Chicago’s downtown Streeterville neighborhood. Smollett told police that he was talking on his cell phone with his talent manager, Brandon Moore, when two men approached him and began yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him. They then began beating him about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, which police believe to be bleach.

At some point during the attack, the men wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck. Surveillance video from the area shows two figures walking in the area where Smollett says the attack occurred, but does not contain footage of the actual attack. Video does show Smollett leave the camera’s view, and emerge over a minute later “wearing a rope like a neck tie,” according to Chicago police.

Moore later told police that he heard the attackers calling Smollett “Empire faggot [racial expletive]” and shouting “This is MAGA country!”

Smollett eventually returned to his home and called police about 40 minutes after the attack. Officers who responded to the house noted that the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and a rope draped around his neck. He was taken to a hospital and treated for injuries sustained during the attack.

While police publicly say they are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, and characterize Smollett as “cooperating” with detectives, the department has also noted that Smollett initially declined to hand over his cell phone or phone records to detectives, which made it hard to confirm whether he was indeed on the phone with Moore at the time of the attack.

When he did turn in phone records, he did so in PDF format, and the records were heavily redacted. As a result, detectives rejected the records and have asked Smollett to submit his phone bill or a download of his entire phone, reports Entertainment Tonight.

A representative for Smollett released a statement noting that the actor is “the victim here.”

“Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” the statement said.

“Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice. Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

Smollett received an outpouring of support in the wake of the attack, with even President Trump weighing in to say the attack was “horrible.”

But several news and media outlets, particularly those supportive of the president, including National Review and the conservative blog Gateway Pundit, have questioned the veracity of Smollett’s account. Conservative radio host and Mediaite contributor John Ziegler even penned an opinion column in which he posits that Smollett lied about the attack — and that police don’t believe his account.

In the column, Ziegler alleges that police and media outlets continue to treat the story as fact because they don’t want to be seen as questioning the veracity of a black, gay, liberal celebrity who might be a victim of a hate crime, or deal with any blowback for calling into question the events surrounding the alleged attack.

“As a conservative, I look at this as his Political Correctness Force Field. Smollett’s protection here is literally about as strong as it gets, especially in Chicago, a city that has a large black population and is extremely liberal,” he writes.

In response to speculation surrounding whether Smollett lied, FOX 32 Chicago’s Rafer Weigel tweeted last week that Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said Smollett is still being treated as a victim as this time, but will be held “accountable” if police believe he made a false report. Weigel later opined that he did not believe that Chicago Police would allow the case to remain unsolved, so they’ll either find the alleged attackers or charge Smollett with filing a false report.

Since so many have asked me if @Chicago_Police will let #JussieSmollett case go unsolved, I’ll give my opinion. Given the high-profile nature of the crime, I don’t believe so. I believe they’ll either find the perpetrators responsible or charge #Smollett w/ filing a false report — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 8, 2019

Smollett released a statement on Feb. 1 about the attack, and expressing frustration over “certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread” by media outlets about the incident. The following day, he appeared on stage at his West Hollywood show at The Troubadour, telling fans he was going to “stand strong” and believes “justice will be served.”

“Thank you so much, and I’m glad you came,” Smollett told the audience. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all, and I had to be here tonight. It sounds powerful but I couldn’t let those motherfuckers win. … Regardless of what anyone says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you will all stand with me.”

Chicago police are also investigating a separate incident that occurred a week before the attack, when a postal worker dropped off a threatening letter at the studio where Empire is filmed. It was postmarked in the suburb of Bedford Park on Jan. 18, with the letters MAGA written in the upper-left corner of the envelope. The note, which was comprised of cut-up letters from books and magazines and contained a white powder inside, allegedly read: “You will die, black fag.” The powder was later to be crushed-up acetaminophen, an ingredient found in Tylenol reports the Chicago Tribune.

Police have not said whether they believe the incidents are related, but they continue to be investigated separately, with the FBI taking the lead in the mail case.

Best TV of 2018 1/10 10) Save Me Lennie James's missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic's impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned. Sky 2/10 9) Cunk on Britain How much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk's history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan's resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What's the most political thing that's ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker's fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan's vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. BBC 3/10 8) Sally4Ever You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain. Sky 4/10 7) The Little Drummer Girl This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. BBC 5/10 6) A Very English Scandal Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it? BBC 6/10 5) Patrick Melrose Edward St Aubyn's Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick's childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he's ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David's wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. Sky 7/10 4) Dynasties At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger & Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world's response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. BBC 8/10 3) Killing Eve It's unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it's simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country's outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings' novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing. BBC 9/10 2) England vs Colombia Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I'm including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate's men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. Rex Features 10/10 1) Succession The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn't go that far but it's certainly at the top. Alamy Stock Photo 1/10 10) Save Me Lennie James's missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

He added: “Then it became a thing of, like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth.’

“And then it became a thing of, like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.’”

Smollett’s interview comes two weeks after police said a 36-year-old member of the Empire cast (who wasn’t named in the police statement but has been identified as Smollett) was attacked by two people at approximately 2am on Tuesday, 29 January.

According to police, the unknown offenders yelled racial and homophobic slurs at Smollett, then ”began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim”.

“At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victims neck. The offenders fled the scene,” the police statement adds.

Authorities have said that Smollett told them the alleged assailants had yelled: “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett took himself to the hospital and was in “good condition”, according to authorities.

The actor later said in a statement that he was OK, adding: ”My body is strong but my soul is stronger.”

Police have investigated the case but no arrests have been made."

JUSSIE SMOLLETT DEFENDED BY CRISIS MANAGER AS CHICAGO POLICE SAY PHONE RECORDS 'INSUFFICIENT'

Smollett, 36, in a clip of the interview published Wednesday, said that while he's angry about his alleged attackers, ""it's also the attacks.""

""At first it was a thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it — cause it's the truth,"" he said. ""Then it became a thing of like, oh, how can you doubt that? Like how do you not believe that? It's the truth.""

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told the Chicago Police Department that he was attacked by two men on Jan. 29 while walking home to his apartment. He alleged the men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him.

Responding officers, according to a police report, found Smollett with a white rope hanging from his neck.

The actor told ABC News that while some people don't believe what he says occurred, ""then it became a thing of like, oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth — you don't even want to see the truth.""

Smollett initially told police that during the attack, he was on the phone with his manager, and his manager claims to have heard part of the attack — making him the only known witness.

Police, however, said that while Smollett submitted his phone records as evidence, they were ""insufficient,"" as the records were heavily redacted.

Smollett's crisis manager defended the actor on Tuesday, telling Fox News that Smollett ""is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police.""

""We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie's attackers and bring them to justice,"" he continued.

A neighbor claimed to have seen a “redneck” with a rope but Chicago police were unable to find video surveillance from the area to support the claim. The description of the “redneck” did not match Smollett’s description of his attackers.

Smollett filed a report with the Chicago Police Department on Jan. 29 stating that two men hurled racist and homophobic slurs before beating him. Smollett also told police his attackers poured a chemical, possibly bleach, over him and put a noose around his neck.

The Chicago Police Department said it is investigating the alleged attack as a possible hate crime.

The 36-year-old actor, who is openly gay, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he is angry about the attack and at people who do not believe his claims.

Social media users began to cast doubt over Smollett's claims after police said they were not able to find footage of the alleged attack after going through a voluminous amount of recordings from the many surveillance cameras in the area.

""I want that video found so badly,"" Smollett said. ""I want them to stop being able to say 'alleged attack.' I want them to be able to see that I fought back. I want a little gay boy to see that I … fought back,"" he said to ABC News.

Officials have released a picture of two ""potential persons of interest"" from a surveillance camera located near where Smollett says he was attacked.

Police said Smollett refused to turn over his phone and phone records to prove he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack. Smollett later gave investigators a PDF file containing a redacted list of his calls.

Smollett said he didn't want to hand over his phone because he has ""private pictures and videos and numbers,"" and he was already wary because of the way some reacted to his account of the attack. ""Inaccurate false statements had already been out there,"" Smollett told ABC News.

One of those rumors was that Smollett has said his attackers were wearing MAGA hats. He said that's not the case. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some kind of racist sundae,"" Smollett said.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson has said he has no reason to believe Smollett is ""not being genuine with"" investigators.

The actor released a statement in the days following the alleged assault and said he was ""working with authorities, and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level.""

""I will never be the man that this did not happen to,"" Smollett said on Good Morning America. ""I'm forever changed."""

“At first it was a thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it ’cause it’s the truth,” Smollett said of his skeptics. “Then it became a thing of like, oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.”

When asked what’s making him angry, the actor answered, “It’s the attackers and it’s also the attacks.”

“I’m pissed off,” Smollett said in a clip of his first interview since the incident, which aired in full on Good Morning America on Thursday morning.

Jussie Smollett , the Empire actor who reported an attack to Chicago police last month that’s being investigated as a possible hate crime, says he's angry that some people are doubting him.

In the Good Morning America interview, Smollett said he believed the two dark figures seen in grainy surveillance images released by police were the men who attacked him.

""For me when that was released I was like, OK. We're getting somewhere,"" Smollett said. ""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. Never did.""

Smollett, who plays one of the most prominent black gay characters on television, told Chicago police on Jan. 29 that he had been attacked early in the morning by two men who hit him in the face, poured a bleachlike chemical on him, tied a rope around his neck, and yelled racist and anti-gay slurs. The actor also told authorities that he had received hate mail on Jan. 22.

The Chicago Police Department and FBI are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Smollett told ABC's Robin Roberts that he thinks he was targeted because he's been an outspoken critic of the president.

""I can just assume I come really, really, really hard against 45,"" Smollet said, referring to Donald Trump. ""I come really, really hard against his administration.""

However, some started to doubt Smollett’s claims when police weren’t immediately able to find surveillance footage supporting his report. Others have been critical of his decision to send police redacted phone records that investigators deemed “not sufficient in a criminal case.”

""Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,"" Smollett’s publicist said in a statement.

Smollett told Good Morning America that he was not willing to hand over his phone to authorities because it stored private pictures and videos as well as the phone numbers of his friends, family, and cast mates.

""If I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" he said on Thursday's interview. ""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country.""



A Chicago police spokesperson confirmed to BuzzFeed News that reports about police possibly charging Smollett for making a false report are not true.

""[Smollett] is still considered a victim,"" a Chicago police spokesperson said Tuesday."

In an interview airing Thursday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Smollett says he is ""pissed off"" over the reaction to his statements about the incident. Smollet has claimed that two men yelled racist, homophobic and pro-Trump language after beating him in a late-night attack while the actor was walking in the city.

“I’m pissed off,” Smollett told host Robin Roberts in an interview clip obtained by Variety. “At first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it,’ ’cause it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you ... not believe that? It’s the truth.' ""

No suspects have been identified in the case, though Chicago police announced two persons of interest in the investigation last month. Police have also said that they have found no video footage yet of the attack, while noting that coverage of Smollett's walk did contain gaps where the actor could not be seen on surveillance cameras.

On Tuesday, Chicago police announced that Smollett had provided ""heavily redacted"" phone records of his calls prior to the attack, which the police had requested to confirm a statement from Smollett that he had been on the phone with his manager just prior to the attack.

“We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation,” Chicago police told The Hill on Tuesday. “However the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation, as they were limited and heavily redacted.”

In their own statement, Smollett's family told The Hill on Tuesday that they were confident police would identify and arrest the actor's attackers.

“Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice,"" the family said."

Jussie Smollett is speaking out about the Chicago attack that left him hospitalized, and again pushing back on rumors that he lied about the homophobic and racist incident.

In a preview of his first interview since the attack in which two men assaulted him, even placing a noose around his neck, Smollett speaks to Good Morning America‘s Robin Roberts, telling her he’s “pissed” that so many have doubted his story.

“I’m pissed off. It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it,’ ’cause it’s the truth,” Smollett said. “Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.'”

“And then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth,” he added.

The Empire actor has shied away from the spotlight since the attack, but during a performance at the Troubadour in Los Angeles earlier this month, Smollett said that he’s not fully healed, but “I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

In a statement to ESSENCE, the actor added, “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. “"

“Good Morning America” has just released a sneak peek of Robin Roberts' exclusive interview with Jussie, which will air Thursday morning.

In the clip, Jussie revealed that he is “pissed off” about what happened to him, stressing that he’s telling the truth in response to those questioning his story. He said, “It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, 'cause it's the truth.' Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that?

And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.'”

According to Jussie, he was attacked by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs who he says beat him and left him with a rope around his neck.

On Wednesday, “Extra’s” Tanika Ray spoke with his siblings Jazz and Jake, who recently took the stage at Jussie’s concert in Los Angeles, his first appearance since being ambushed. Jake commented, “It was extremely important for us to be there for sure, for support.”

Jazz emphasized, “It was important for us to put out the statement to be there — we’re a strong family. He is healing, so we are happy about that.”

When asked if they have discussed Jussie’s safety as a family, Jazz said, “We’ve talked about a lot as a family.”

Jake and Jazz are working as a family in their new TV One show, “Living by Design with Jake and Jazz,"" on which they transform living, work, and play spaces of millennial families. Jazz pointed out, “I do design and dessert, he does build and meal.”

Jake added, “We makeover a room in their just to bring in up and make them feel at home.

But will Smollett’s interview with ABC’s Robin Roberts on “Good Morning America” put to rest questions that have been raised about the reported attack? Several right-wing figures, including Donald Trump Jr., James Woods and Candace Owens, have wondered whether the reported incident was a hoax.

The interview will mark the first time the “Empire” actor has answered questions about the incident, which brought an outpouring of sympathy by his co-stars, other entertainment figures and Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. senators and presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.

In a promotional clip for the interview, the openly gay 36-year-old actor and LGBTQ activist is seen becoming tearful after Roberts asks him if he feared for his life at any point during the attack. At another point in the interview, Smollett tells Roberts that he’s “pissed off” because people question whether he’s telling the truth.

“It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ’cause it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth,'” he said.

Jussie Smollett reveals he's ""pissed off"" in first interview since attack https://t.co/a0Q6X48FGZ pic.twitter.com/cdW3kcmwy0 — Variety (@Variety) February 13, 2019

According to reports, Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on “Empire,” was attacked about 2 a.m. Jan. 29 after he left a Subway restaurant near his apartment. The attackers first yelled racial and homophobic slurs before they beat him and poured an unknown chemical substance over him, officials said; they also reportedly yelled “This is MAGA country,” and one wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck.

Along with the support and sympathy, the incident has brought an intense level of scrutiny and back-and-forth reports and social media discussion focusing on Smollett’s narrative.

Among the many questions: Would racist thugs spouting a pro-Trump slogan really target Smollett in the middle of a cold winter night in a well-known liberal city like Chicago? Why haven’t hundreds of hours of surveillance video from around Smollett’s apartment captured images of the attack? Police only have said they found video showing two “potential persons of interest,” ABC News reported in January.

On Feb. 5, a reporter for the Fox News affiliate in Chicago tweeted that police so far regard Smollett as a victim but would hold him “accountable” if his report proved to be false.

#ChicagoPolice Supt Eddie Johnson says #JussieSmollett is still being treated as the victim in this case but if the investigation does reveal he made a false report he will be held accountable. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 5, 2019

Several days later, Mediaite writer John Ziegler reported that the Chicago media has largely treated Smollett’s story about the attack as legitimate. However, it’s a different story “behind the scenes,” Ziegler said. Multiple people covering the assault have told Ziegler that “there is near unanimity among police sources that Smollett’s story is very likely not true.”

This week, a Chicago police spokesperson added to the impression that investigators may doubt Smollett’s story by telling the New York Post that phone records he handed over were “insufficient to corroborate some of the information,” Deadline reported. The information was said to include whether Smollett was speaking to his music manager Brandon Z. Moore during a part of the assault.

To critics, Anthony Guglielmi’s statement to The Post suggested that Smollett wasn’t being as cooperative as he could be or that he had something to hide. Guglielmi told the Post that the phone records were “limited” and “redacted” and in a form that could be “manipulated.” While Guglielmi said police did not believe these records had in fact been manipulated, he also said, “We need something a little more concrete and direct if we’re going to be able to say for a fact the conversation occurred.”

Smollett’s critics also didn’t buy the actor’s explanation for why he didn’t immediately turn over his phone to police, because he was “uncomfortable” doing so.

Predictably, Guglielmi’s statement set off another round of back-and-forth outcry, recriminations and declarations, including from Smollett himself on Tuesday. The day before ABC announced Smollett’s “Good Morning America” interview, his representatives hit back at any suggestion that he had been less than cooperative with the police investigation.

“Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” the statement read, according to Deadline. “Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim.”

“We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice,” the statement continued. The statement added that any “redacted information” in the phone records was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.

As some continued to raise questions about Smollett’s story, he has supporters who have question whether there are people in the Chicago Police Department who have participated in an effort to discredit him.

Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, tweeted:

Jussie Smollett says he’s angry over attacks from people who doubt he was the victim of a racist and homophobic assault in Chicago last month.

“I’m pissed off,” the “Empire” star says in a snippet of an interview for “Good Morning America” that will air Thursday.

“What is it that has you so angry?” Robin Roberts asks the star in the clip released Wednesday. “Is it the … attackers?”

“Attackers, but it’s also the attacks,” Smollett, 36, responds, explaining that he is frustrated by those who don’t believe his story.

“At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth.”

Added Smollett: “Then it became a thing of, like, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.”

The interview comes two weeks after Smollett told Chicago police two men assaulted him while calling him “f—–t” and “n—-r,” and yelling “MAGA country,” a reference to President Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.”

They allegedly poured chemicals on him, believed to be bleach, and put a rope around his neck.

In the days that followed, Smollett was hesitant to turn over his phone records, which cops had requested, but eventually handed them in this week. He stated that he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Moore, at the time of the attack.

Police say the phone records are “limited and redacted” and insufficient for a criminal investigation."

In the clip ABC previewed ahead of his full interview for Good Morning America, Smollett said he was “pissed off” after being attacked in a possible hate crime. When Robert asked who or what he was angry with, Smollett answered with the attackers, but it’s also the attacks.”

“It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ’cause it’s the truth.” Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you– how do you not believe that? It’s the truth. And then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.”

Last month, Smollett drew media attention over his claim that he was harassed and physically by two people who taunted him with racial and homophobic slurs. At the time, TMZ reported that Smollett’s attackers berated him with pro-Donald Trump slogans, but the police have never incorporated that detail into their statements on the incident, and there have never been any corroborating accounts to support TMZ.

The Chicago Police Department is treating the attack on Smollett as a “racially-charged assault and battery,” but they’ve expressed dissatisfaction with the phone records Smollett’s team have given them as they continue to investigate. A Chicago PD spokesman recently said the partially-redacted records were “insufficient to corroborate some of the information” regarding the case.

Smollett’s team insists the redactions were done to protect the privacy of contacts and people who aren’t relevant to the attack.

“Chicago Police have not told us that they are rejecting any records, nor have they expressed concerns about the records to us,” Smollett’s reps have said. “Therefore, we don’t feel compelled to be bated into responding to uncorroborated press reports. We are dealing directly with the Chicago Police Department.”

There’ve been other recent rumors that the actor has changed his story or been reluctant to provide more information.

The full interview will air tomorrow on ABC at 7:00 A.M. ET.

Following the announcement of the “Empire” star’s Outstanding Supporting Actor nod for his performance on the Fox drama, TheWrap spoke with NAACP president Derrick Johnson about the list of nominations — and his opinion on how the press is covering Smollett’s story.

“It’s unfortunate, the media is verging on demonizing a victim,” Johnson told us during the Television Critics Association press tour. “And in order for us to truly root out racial hate crimes and crimes based on homophobia, we need not to demonize the victim. We need to aggressively pursue a course of action that if, in fact, individuals committed these crimes they are held accountable, as well as pursue a course of action in the media to allow people to understand that we must have more tolerance and acceptance of all citizens.”

In terms of how the NAACP Image Awards, which will be broadcast live on TV One on March 30, will address Smollett’s story during the telecast, Johnson isn’t sure yet. But he says the topic isn’t specific to the “Empire” star, even though the story of the potential hate crime against him is currently receiving a significant amount of media attention.

“It’s just not Jussie’s situation, it’s a current climate of intolerance. [The] NAACP, primary to our mission is [to] fight against discrimination. So as we develop the script for the show I am almost positive, as we do every year, [that it will] address the current trend of intolerance, whether it’s racial intolerance, xenophobia, homophobia or gender bias. Those are important issues that we’ve taken on and it will be a thread throughout the show.”

In the two weeks since Empire actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago, the Internet has been swept up in the reported crime. Many have sent messages of support to Smollett, some have commented on what they perceive as strange and misleading details about the case, and Smollett has remained relatively quiet.

But now, Smollett has given his first interview since the attack. Helmed by ABC’s Robin Roberts, the interview will air on Good Morning America on Thursday morning. The interview will focus on the attack, the ensuing police investigation and the social response to the news.

In an early clip released from the interview, Smollett said he was ""pissed off"" and spoke about his frustration with those who claim he fabricated the attack to gain fame. ""It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, 'cause it's the truth,’"" he said. “Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you -- how do you not believe that? It's the truth.’ And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.'""

Recent reports from the Chicago Police Department show that Smollett handed over his official phone records, but that police found the heavily redacted records “insufficient” and asked for more. Smollett’s team issued a statement following the attack, reiterating the actor’s commitment to finding the perpetrators and his “consistent and credible” story.

The full segment will air Thursday morning on “Good Morning America.”

“I’m pissed off,” the actor told Roberts. “It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it,’ ’cause it’s the truth.

“And then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.”

Smollett, 36, plays a gay man on the Fox series “Empire,” and came out as gay himself in 2015. The police report details that the attackers approached him at 2 a.m., made homophobic slurs against him and hit him in the face with their hands. The attackers have yet to be identified.

According to the report, “The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black. The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled.”

Since the attack, Smollett has mostly stayed out of the public eye, stepping out only once to perform at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on Feb. 2.

“I’m not fully healed yet…but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all,” he told the crowd at the Troubadour. “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those [expletive] win,” he added. “Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope that you all stand with me.”

As TheWrap first reported, “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts snagged the first interview with the “Empire” star since he told police that he was attacked in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood while walking to his apartment. According to Smollett, two men attacked him while yelling racial and homophobic slurs and referencing “MAGA.” A police statement said chemicals were poured on the “Empire” star’s face, and a rope placed around his neck.

But Smollett’s account has been questioned after the Chicago Police Department said the actor was slow to turn over material pertinent to the investigation.

“What is it that has you so angry? Is it the…attackers?” Roberts asked.

“Attackers, but it’s also the attacks,” Smollett responded. “It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ’cause it’s the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you– how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.'”

Police had asked for Smollett’s phone records because he said he was on a call with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, during the attack.

On January 31, two days after the incident, CPD said that detectives “were not able to independently verify the statements as cell phone records were not provided to investigators when asked. Therefore we are not able to confirm this.”

Smollett did eventually turn over his phone records. But Chicago police said they were too heavily redacted to be useful to their investigation. A Chicago police spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said in a statement, “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

On Tuesday, Smollett’s publicists pushed back, saying that the actor was only trying to protect “the privacy of personal contacts.”

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” his reps said in a statement.

The Empire actor tells Robin Roberts at Good Morning America in an advance preview of his upcoming interview that he's ""pissed off"" by suggestions that he might not have been truthful in his police report.

""What is it that has you so angry? Is it the…attackers?"" Roberts asked.

The 36-year old, who plays a gay musician on the Fox drama, says he was attacked by two unidentified assailants while walking home around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He said the attackers abused him with racial and homophobic slurs, hung a rope around his neck, and doused him with a liquid that might have been bleach. An ongoing police investigation has been unable to find surveillance footage of the attack or suspects matching Smollett's description yet also do not have the actor's entire walk home on camera. There's also been some delay in Smollett giving the police his phone records in a form that the authorities find acceptable (he says he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack). Some outlets have suggested Smollett might have perpetuated a ""hoax.""

Rapper Rich the Kid and his entourage were involved in a shooting and robbery at a West Hollywood studio in Los Angeles where Usher was recording Tuesday afternoon.

According to Variety, the Plug Walk rapper and his entourage were the targets of the robbery, which took place outside of Westlake Recording Studio.

The attack was a robbery targeting Rich the Kid, who was outside the studio at the time, according to reports.

At the time of the incident, Usher was inside the studio and not involved.

A representative for Rich the Kid confirmed that the 26-year-old rapper is OK.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department posted a description of the robbery but did not mention Rich the Kid or Usher in the report.

According to authorities, the victims said that three suspects confronted them in the alley behind the studio and “demanded their money and jewelry. The victims were then physically assaulted by the suspects.”

The shooting reportedly occurred as the suspects fled the scene.

According to reports obtained by TMZ, who was first to report the story, a man was seen running away from the studio and fired as many as 10 gunshots. No one was hit.

Calls came in at around 3:15 p.m. reporting shots fired in the area of Santa Monica Boulevard at Greenacre Avenue, the Sheriff’s Department said.

No one was taken to the hospital but several victims were treated for minor injuries at the scene, including Rich the Kid’s bodyguard. The bodyguard was reportedly beaten with a firearm.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

In a preview for the segment, which will air on Thursday (US time), the Empire star is seen giving a tearful account of the incident, which Chicago police have described as a possible hate crime that was racially motivated and homophobic.

When Roberts asks if at anytime during the attack he feared for his life, the musician is seen breaking into tears.

The 36-year-old has previously addressed the incident - which roiled advocates nationwide because it reportedly involved a chemical being poured on the actor and a noose being tied on his neck - through his publicist and while performing at the Troubadour earlier this month.

But Thursday's interview will be his first time detailing the events to the public on camera.

While Smollett has been cooperating with Chicago police, investigators recently rejected his phone records as evidence because they ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted"", a spokesperson for the department said on Wednesday.

Detectives might be following up with Smollett to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline. Meanwhile, his neighbours and other reports have also cast doubt on his account.

​Smollett responded to skepticism about his account with a new statement on Tuesday, saying that redacted information was meant to protect his privacy and contact information for other individuals not relevant to the attack.

""Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible,"" his reps told Deadline on Tuesday, clarifying that Smollett has always been a victim in the case.

""We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie's attackers and bring them to justice,"" the statement said.

Smollett's reps did not immediately respond to request for comment on Wednesday.

Smollett told police he was was approached early Tuesday by two masked men who shouted “racial and homophobic slurs” before punching him in the face, pouring an unknown chemical on him and wrapping a rope around his neck. The actor, who is gay, reportedly told investigators his attackers cited President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan during the assault.

The reported crime prompted an outpouring of support from Smollett’s “Empire” co-stars, as well as other celebrities like John Legend, Margaret Cho and Billy Eichner. Hart sympathized late Tuesday on Twitter and Instagram, urging Smollett to “stand strong brother.”

Almost immediately, the comedian’s remarks sparked a backlash on social media. Many called attention to Hart’s controversial use of anti-gay jokes in both his comedy sketches and on Twitter.

Many of Hart’s LGBTQ-referencing jokes and tweets dated back to 2010 and 2011, before he was an established name in Hollywood. They resurfaced in the media in December, after the comedian was announced as the host of the 91st Academy Awards, set to take place on Feb. 24.

Hart initially refused to apologize for his statements, claiming he’d previously done so in interviews (though evidence of that is scant). Days after his Oscars gig was announced, he stepped down as the host and apologized.

On Wednesday, Hart shot back at those who criticized his support of Smollett, pointing to himself as “an example” of the type of “change” LGBTQ advocates were encouraging.

I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person.

Chicago police haven’t publicly identified any suspects in Smollett’s attack, but released images of “potential persons of interest” late Wednesday.

Smollett, meanwhile, has left Chicago’s Northwestern Memorial Hospital after being treated for cuts to his face and neck. He’s set to return to the concert stage Saturday for a previously scheduled performance in Los Angeles.

The actor’s representative, Pamela Sharp, has said he is “recovering well.”"

Chicago Police seem to be shifting gears in their investigation involving Jussie Smollett, who reported being brutally attacked on January 29th.

Smollett reported that two attackers slashed the actor’s face and splashed a toxic substance on him, while screaming ‘This is MAGA country!’ According to the actor, a noose was applied to Smollett’s neck during the brutal attack.

Roughly 40 minutes later, police found Smollett back at his apartment, with the noose loosened but still around his neck.

MAGA references Donald Trump’s presidential campaign slogan, ‘Make America Great Again’. That, coupled with the noose, clearly made this a racist, hate-fueled attack. Smollett is openly-gay, African-American, and actively engaged in LGBTQ issues.

The attack prompted an immediate response, with Trump himself denouncing the attack. Chicago Police also got involved, with roughly one dozen investigators scrutinizing footage from more than 20 area video cameras.

But despite the intense search, virtually no clues have emerged. The only possible lead involved two shadowy figures, filmed walking down a nearby street.

Now, Chicago investigators appear to be tussling with Smollett over critical phone records as this investigation hits a wall.

The actor had previously refused to hand over his cell phone, which may have offered important evidence in this case. Smollett’s manager, who was speaking with the actor immediately prior to the attack, has also refused to supply phone records.

That raised questions over whether Chicago Police were being hamstrung in their investigation. Earlier this week, Smollett reluctantly agreed to hand over heavily redacted phone records. But Chicago Police investigators say it isn’t enough to adequately piece together the events of January 29th.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has stated that the records were inadequate. Perhaps treading a delicate balance, Johnson also reiterated that Smollett was a victim in this attack, and is being treated accordingly. But according to Fox 32 Chicago, Johnson previously noted that Smollett would be ‘held accountable’ if the attack turns out to be a false report.

The growing rift has prompted a response from Smollett, specifically from crisis management firm Sunshine Sachs. “Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” the statement reads.

“Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”"

The Empire actor’s interview with ABC’s Robin Roberts will air Thursday on Good Morning America.

In a short promo for the sit down, Smollett can be seen tearing up after Roberts asks him if he feared for his life at any point during the alleged hate crime.

This will mark the first time the 36-year-old answers questions on camera about the incident which made headlines and dominated social media feeds.

Initially, Smollett received an outpouring of love and support from both fans and celebrities in aftermath of the attack. The public seemed to stand by him while condemning the violent discrimination that he was subjected to. And Chicago Police launched a manhunt for the attackers who shouted, “This is MAGA country!” after punching his ribs, pouring bleach over his head and tying a noose around his neck.

But some people began to question if the alleged assualt was too sensational to be true.

“Famous rich people, when bad things happen they want to cover the story” opined Joe Budden on a recent episode of State Of The Culture. “You cover the story to protect your image, your likeness and your career.”

Budden then clarified that his biggest concern is that this story is being used to manipulate the emotions of a community that’s already on edge. Adding, “I’m waiting for footage. Just show me footage and I’ll shut the f**k up.”

Despite many people’s inability to accept the details of the assault, Tuesday night, a spokesman for the actor issued a statement which reads: “Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police.

“Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police,” it clarifies. “Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible.

According to Smollett, he was assaulted by two men after he left a local Subway restaurant. The men allegedly wore ski masks and, according to the “Empire” actor, his attackers also yelled homophobic and racial slurs and “This is MAGA country” and then began beating him while continuing their vile tirade. The assailants then allegedly poured bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck before leaving the scene.

Since that time, Smollett’s version of the story has been questioned and claims of a hate crime hoax leveled by some on social media.

Smollett and his supporters have stood by his story, and many are stating that he should not be questioned over the veracity of the alleged assault. The Chicago Police Department found itself in the national spotlight and spokespersons from the department have assured the public that they are investigating all possible leads. Those leads have been few and have included a video of two unidentified men walking down the street who have been called persons of interests by police.

One of the major pieces of evidence to support Smollett’s story was his claim that he was talking to his manager on the phone at the time of his attack. The manager has maintained that he heard the assault, and police requested that Smollett turn over his phone as part of the investigation. Smollett declined this initial request citing privacy concerns, and instead opted to give the police a copy of his cell phone bill. According to TMZ, Smollett did, in fact, turn over a redacted version of his bill to Chicago police, but apparently, investigators are not satisfied with this record.

“Entertainment Tonight” quoted an unnamed source in the Chicago Police Department who has stated that the submitted bill is not being considered as evidence. The alleged reason for the refusal is that a redacted bill was submitted in the form of a PDF, and this type of file can be manipulated. However, the source stated that the Chicago Police Department is not accusing anyone of manipulating the document.

A representative for Smollett stated to “ET”:

“Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice. Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

Last week, according to Fox 32 Chicago reporter Rafer Weiel, Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said that, if the investigation does reveal Smollett made a false report, the actor will be held accountable."

Smollett’s representatives issued a statement a day after police said the heavily redacted phone records he turned over to detectives this week were insufficient for a criminal investigation.

The statement is the latest in a back-and-forth between Smollett and police since he reported the attack in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Police have made no arrests and said they have found no surveillance video that shows the attack. They have released video of two people in the area at the time who they said were persons of interest.

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,” the statement said. “Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.”

Smollett’s statement said he had good reasons for turning over limited information.

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” his statement said.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before and looped a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck. Smollett also told detectives that before they ran off, the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country, ” a reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan President Donald Trump uses.

Smollett and his family have insisted that he has been truthful about the attack and his story has not changed since it happened.

Police have collected video surveillance footage from cameras in the downtown area and have also extended their search to stores in the area in the hopes of gathering evidence on who might have purchased the rope."

5am – A/B/C Senate has found ‘no direct evidence’ Trump colluded with Russia: report. As it begins to wrap up its investigation, the Senate Intelligence Committee has not found “any direct evidence” that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians during the 2016 presidential election, according to a report on Tuesday. “After two years and interviewing more than 200 witnesses, the Senate intelligence Committee has not uncovered any direct evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia,” NBC correspondent Ken Dilanian told MSNBC anchor Hallie Jackson. She appeared stunned by the revelation. “Not to put too fine a point on it, but I want to make sure I’m understanding this,” Jackson said. “If and when the president, as he may inevitably do, point to this reporting, point to these conclusions and says, ‘Look, the Senate Intelligence Committee found I’m not guilty of conspiracy,’ he would be correct in saying that?” “He’ll be partially right,” Dilanian responded, adding that the committee doesn’t decide guilt.

The NBC report noted that the GOP chairman of the committee made similar comments last week about collusion. “If we write a report based upon the facts that we have, then we don’t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia,” said Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina in an interview with CBS. NBC said the committee’s final report will question the campaign’s judgment after associates and some Trump family members had contact with a number of Russians.

5am – D Bill Nye the Science Guy unapologetically misrepresenting the views of pro-lifers.

5am – E Chicago Police: Jussie Smollett’s ‘Redacted’ Phone Records Not Enough for Criminal Investigation. The Chicago Police Department said Monday that it does not have enough evidence to launch a criminal investigation into the alleged assault of Empire actor Jussie Smollett after he turned over “limited and redacted phone records” to detectives. “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. “Detectives may be following up with him to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.” Smollett alleges two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant on January 29. The 36-year-old alleges they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck. Guglielmi said the actor told police that the alleged attackers shouted he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. The police report noted that the actor said he initially didn’t want to report the attack, but another person convinced him to do so. The name of the person who encouraged Smollet to call police was redacted in the report, which notes that the person was with Smollet when officers arrived at his Chicago apartment. When officers arrived at his apartment, Smollett still had a white rope draped around his neck. The report also noted that officers turned off their body cameras at Smollett’s request — a reasonable request from crime victims, according to police.



6am – A Kamala Harris says she listened to Snoop Dogg, Tupac while smoking weed in college years before they made music. (Fox News) – California Sen. Kamala Harris claims she listened to Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur when she smoked pot in college – but the West Coast rappers weren’t putting out music until years after she graduated. “I have. And I inhaled. I did inhale,” Harris said when asked if she has smoked weed. “It was a joint.” Harris made her comments Monday on “The Breakfast Club,” the New York City-based nationally syndicated radio program hosted by DJ Envy, Angela Yee and Charlamagne tha God. The program touts that it is “the world’s most dangerous morning show” and is popular in the hip hop community. The 2020 Democratic presidential contender was then asked what music she listened to when she smoked a joint. Charlamagne tha God bluntly asked, “What was you listening to when you was high? What was on? What song was on?” Harris quickly responded, “Definitely Snoop, Tupac for sure.” However, Harris graduated from Howard University in 1986 and was finished with law school by 1989. She was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1990.

President Trump says he will fund the border wall with money from ‘other sources’ apart from Congress. President Trump said Tuesday night that he’ll find sources of money for his border wall other than Congress, which has reached a tentative deal to give him $1.375 billion for border barriers. “Was just presented the concept and parameters of the Border Security Deal by hard working Sen. Richard Shelby,” Trump tweeted. “Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources.” “Will be getting almost $23 BILLION for Border Security,” he added. “Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak!”

6am – E McConnell Plans To Bring Green New Deal To Senate Vote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made a surprise announcement on Tuesday: He’s planning to hold a vote on the Green New Deal. But it’s not because he thinks it’s a good idea. The sweeping joint resolution to tackle climate change aggressively was proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) last week. McConnell now wants to put Senate Democrats on the record about whether they support it. It’s an especially prescient political move, given how many Democrats in the Senate are running for president in 2020. “I’ve noted with interest the Green New Deal. We’re going to be voting on that in the Senate; it will give everybody an opportunity to go on record and see how they feel about the Green New Deal,” McConnell said during a Tuesday press conference. Nearly all the biggest 2020 names are co-sponsors on the Green New Deal — declared candidates Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) are all on the bill, as is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is expected to make an announcement about running.

6am – F Gov. Larry Hogan informs Redskins he is withdrawing effort to build new stadium at Maryland site ‘at this time.’ Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) informed the Washington Redskins that he is withdrawing from efforts to persuade the team to build its next stadium in Oxon Cove Park, adjacent to MGM ­National Harbor, “at this time,” his spokeswoman confirmed Tuesday night. Hogan’s decision represents a reversal after acknowledging in December that he had negotiated a nonbinding land swap with U.S. Interior Department officials that could have cleared the way for the Redskins to build their proposed 60,000-seat stadium on the parcel of federal land in Prince George’s County. Moreover, barring a change of heart, Hogan’s decision strips Redskins owner Daniel Snyder of significant leverage in getting his new stadium built — leverage Snyder was counting on when, and if, he starts negotiating with officials in the District on financial incentives and accommodations for the project. Hogan is not abandoning his effort to acquire the Oxon Cove site for other purposes, according to Amelia Chasse, his communications director. He is simply halting talks with the Redskins. “We are not continuing discussions with the Redskins regarding this site at this time, however we are moving full steam ahead with acquiring state control of the Maryland Gateway in Prince George’s County from the federal government,” Chasse wrote in response to an email from The Washington Post asking whether Hogan had withdrawn support of a new Redskins stadium in Maryland. “We believe this site holds significant potential benefits for the region and the state, as does the proposal to expand protected federal parkland in Western Maryland. We are working closely with our federal partners to finalize the transfer.” Snyder’s first choice of location for his new stadium is the RFK Stadium site in the District, where the Redskins played from 1961 to 1996 and won three Super Bowl championships under Hall of Fame Coach Joe Gibbs.

7am – B Cory Booker: ‘This Planet Simply Can’t Sustain’ People Eating Meat. Democrat 2020 hopeful is vegan because eating eggs ‘didn’t align with my spirit’ (Washington Free Beacon) — Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) said the planet “can’t sustain” people eating meat, as the 2020 hopeful aims to become the first vegan president. Booker told the vegan magazine VegNews earlier this month that he became vegan after coming to the realization that eating eggs “didn’t align with my spirit.” While claiming he does not want to lecture Americans on their diets, Booker says Americans need to be nudged into fake cheese because the planet cannot sustain the “environmental impact” of the food industry. “You see the planet earth moving towards what is the Standard American Diet,” Booker said. “We’ve seen this massive increase in consumption of meat produced by the industrial animal agriculture industry.” “The tragic reality is this planet simply can’t sustain billions of people consuming industrially produced animal agriculture because ofnvironmental impact,” he said. “It’s just not possible.” Booker says the “devastating impact” of greenhouse gases produced by the meat industry is “just not practical.” Booker argues all his nonvegan friends “love” vegan food like his favorites, “vegan pancakes” and “vegan stuffed French toast.”

7am – D/E Georgetown students vote to tax themselves reparations for slavery. (Washington Examiner) — Students at Georgetown University are considering paying reparations for slaves that Georgetown University sold more than 180 years ago. Earlier this month, the Georgetown student government authorized a campus-wide student referendum that will ask students to establish a fund for the descendants of these 272 slaves. If the referendum passes, a fee would be collected each semester, starting in the fall of 2020. The semesterly fee proposed is $27.20 per student “in honor of the 272 people sold by Georgetown,” according to the student government resolution approving the referendum, obtained by the College Fix. Students receiving financial aid will be able to opt out of the reparations payments, according to student news outlet the Hoya. The student government resolution approving the campus-wide referendum passed by a vote of 20 in favor and four against. “It’s manifestly Georgetown University’s obligation to make financial commitments regarding its legacy with slavery, not student’s,” student senator Evan Farraras said at the senate meeting. “Additionally, student money should only be used towards student’s purposes, even if non-student purposes are meaningful, as in today’s referendum.”

A police spokesman told reporters on Monday that new video was being “downloaded and reviewed.” Authorities are looking for more details about the incident, during which Smollett said he was accosted by two masked men who shouted homophobic and racial slurs and then wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him. One of the assailants, the actor later said, yelled “MAGA country!” as they left.

Though police have reviewed video evidence that Smollett had a rope around his neck when he arrived at his apartment building early on Jan. 29, they haven’t yet seen footage of the attack itself, according to Fox News. Security footage has led them to two unidentified persons of interest, and Smollett said his attackers seemed to know who he was, according to the Associated Press.

Smollett, a gay black actor-musician who plays Jamal Lyon on the Fox series “Empire,” spoke out for the first time this past Friday, three days after the alleged attack, as rumors swirled about the details of the incident.

“Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” he told Essence in a statement.

On Saturday, during a musical performance in West Hollywood, California, he got more specific. “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken,” he told the crowd. “I went to the doctor immediately. … I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in LA and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all, I fought the fuck back.”

Chicago police have said that Smollett is cooperating with the investigation and that there’s “no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us,” Fox News reports."

According to Chicago police, Smollett told them two men yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him before beating him and pouring “an unknown chemical substance” on him. One of the men reportedly put a rope around Smollett’s neck.

Police referred to the incident as a “possible racially-charged assault and battery” and are investigating it as “a possible hate crime.”

20th Century Fox Television, the network which airs “Empire,” condemned the “despicable act of violence and hate,” and called Smollett “resilient and strong.”

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” the network said in a statement. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Several of Smollett’s colleagues on the show offered words of sympathy and support on Twitter, including guest star Vivica A. Fox.

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels addressed Smollett directly in an emotional Instagram video.

“Jussie, you are my son,” Daniels said. “You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, or to be called ‘Die, faggot, nigger,’ or whatever they said to you. You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united on [a] united front. And no racist fuck can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up, Jussie.”

Co-creator Danny Strong called Smollett “a kind and profoundly talented soul,” and called the perpetrators “nothing but hate filled cowards.”

I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett. He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live... — Danny Strong (@Dannystrong) January 29, 2019

...whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come. — Danny Strong (@Dannystrong) January 29, 2019

“Empire” writer and director Eric Haywood tweeted: “I will burn your fucking house down to protect [Smollett]. Write that shit down.”

Smollett, who plays the openly gay character Jamal Lyon on the show, came out as gay in 2015 on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” GLAAD, the LGBTQ advocacy organization, said in a statement.

Other celebrities expressed their anger about the reported assault and offered Smollett and his family support.

PREVIOUSLY:

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was reportedly attacked in Chicago early Tuesday morning in what police are calling a possible hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed to HuffPost it had received a report Tuesday morning that a cast member on the Fox drama was the victim of a “possible racially-charged assault and battery.” Smollett was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after the attack but has already been released. Police said he is in “good condition.”

The FBI has taken over the investigation amid reports that Smollett received a threatening letter sometime before the attack, according to ABC News.

Police said Smollett told them two men began “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” before physically attacking the actor. During the attack, the two men “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him, and one of the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck, he said.

TMZ, citing unnamed sources “directly connected to Jussie,” reported that the men yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him. The outlet also reported that the unknown chemical substance was bleach and that, after the attack, the men told Smollett, “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police told HuffPost Tuesday morning. “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.”

The actor came out as gay during an interview on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” in 2015.

“It was a bigger deal to everyone than it was for me. But at the same time I do understand why it is something to talk about,” Smollett said at the time, adding, “I was ready to talk about it. She told me, ‘You don’t have to.’ I will be forever grateful to Ellen for the kindness she showed me. And that made me want to talk about it.”

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said that the company is “deeply saddened and outraged” by the attack.

“We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,” the company wrote in a statement. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

People, including actress Zendaya and the Rev. Al Sharpton, reacted to the terrible news on Twitter.

Chad Griffin, president of Human Rights Campaign, noted that the reported violence against Smollett was part of a pattern: “This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident. There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities ― and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities.”

The Empire actor is set to appear on Good Morning America Thursday, where he will address the attack in a candid interview with Robin Roberts.

In a teaser clip from the interview, the actor becomes emotional when Roberts asks, “At any point during the attack, did you fear for your life?”

Smollett previously opened up about the attack during his first public appearance at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on Feb. 2.

“There are so many words on my heart that I want to say,” he said. “The most important thing that I can say, to keep it simple, thank you so much. I’m okay … I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. I’m going to stand strong with y’all.”

“I had to be here tonight,” he added. “I couldn’t let those motherf—ers win. So I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. I hope that you all stand with me.”

He also clarified reports about the apparent hate crime.

“Just because there has been a lot of stuff that has been said about me that is absolutely not true, there are just a couple of points that I wanted to make really quick,” he said. “I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked. I went to the doctor immediately — I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take it easy, obviously. And, above all, I fought the f— back.”

At around 2 a.m. in Chicago on Jan. 29, Smollett transported himself to a doctor after he was the victim of an apparent hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department previously confirmed in a statement that a member of the hit Fox show was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery.”

“Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the statement continued. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

Smollett’s family also released a statement about the attack."

The sit-down, conducted by ABC News’ Robin Roberts, is slated to air Thursday morning.

The interview comes after the 36-year-old actor said he redacted some information from his phone before giving it to Chicago police investigating a reported assault in order to protect the privacy of contacts and people who are not relevant to the attack.

Smollett’s representatives issued a statement a day after police said the heavily redacted phone records he turned over to detectives this week were insufficient for a criminal investigation.

The statement is the latest in a back-and-forth between Smollett and police since he reported the attack in downtown Chicago on January 29. Police have made no arrests and said they have found no surveillance video that shows the attack. They have released video of two people in the area at the time who they said were persons of interest.

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,” the statement said. “Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.”

However, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Monday that the phone records turned over by Smollett are in a heavily redacted document file and the records from the manager Smollett says he was talking to when the attack occurred were a screenshot of phone calls. He says the records aren’t sufficient for an investigation. “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” Guglielmi said. “Detectives may be following up with him to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.”

Smollett’s statement said he had good reasons for turning over limited information.

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” his statement said.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before and looped a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck. Smollett also told detectives that before they ran off, the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country, ” a reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan President Donald Trump uses.

Smollett and his family have insisted that he has been truthful about the attack and his story has not changed since it happened. “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” the actor said in a statement to ESSENCE magazine. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Police have collected video surveillance footage from cameras in the downtown area and have also extended their search to stores in the area in the hopes of gathering evidence on who might have purchased the rope.

Days after the story broke, Smollett gave a concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, telling the crowd that if he did not perform, it would be a victory for the assailants. “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the motherfuckers win,” he said as concert-goers which included Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and filmmaker Lee Daniels looked on. “I have so many words on my heart. The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay,” he said. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all. l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love.

The 36-year-old actor sat down with Robin Roberts for an interview that will air Thursday on ABC's Good Morning America. In the first promo for the interview, Smollett can be seen tearing up as Roberts asks him questions.

""What happened that night?"" Roberts can be heard asking in the short clip. ""At any point during the attack, did you fear for your life?""

Smollett has previously addressed the incident, which Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime that was racially motivated and homophobic, through his publicist and at a concert of his earlier this month, but Thursday's interview will be his first time detailing the events on camera.

Earlier this week, investigators recently rejected Smollett's phone records as evidence because ""they do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,"" a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department said.

Smollett has previously been cooperating with the investigation.

Detectives might be following up with Smollett to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline. Smollett had told police he was on the phone with his manager on Jan. 29 when the alleged attack occurred.

A representative for the actor said in a statement to Page Six on Tuesday that he redacted information from his phone records for his privacy.

“Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,"" Smollett's representative said. ""Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

The representative continued, “Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack. Chicago Police have not told us that they are rejecting any records, nor have they expressed concerns about the records to us. Therefore, we don’t feel compelled to be bated into responding to uncorroborated press reports. We are dealing directly with the Chicago Police Department.”

Smollett made his first public appearance since the attack earlier this month at a performance in West Hollywood, California, just days after the attack. ""I had to be here tonight, y'all,"" Smollett told the crowd. ""I couldn't let those motherf—ers win.""

Chicago police released a photo of the potential suspects, which showed two men wearing dark clothing. At this time, no footage of the attack appears to exist.

Smollett told Essence that he was doing ""OK"" in the days following the attack, during which two men allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured a chemical that could possibly be bleach on him, and tied a rope around his neck.

""Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett's told Essence. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

He said he is hopeful that the attackers will be brought to justice. “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served."""

In case you’re wondering why the Chicago PD doesn’t just come out and say what everybody in the department and the local media knows is true, that Jussie Smollett is a lying sack of shit who false-flagged his imaginary beatings for his own PR:

The usual whackjobs will go nuts.

If they did come out and charge Smollett with filing a false police report, which is what they should do, they figure the reaction from the SJRaceWarriors will be outrageous. So the better part of valor is to just pretend that they take NooseBoy seriously.

Here’s a couple of updates:

Why, indeed?

Also, Hillary Clinton’s Hot Sauce Bottle Found:

Jussie Smollett attack: New York Post reporters find bottle with bleach-smelling liquid along route taken by actor, police say | abc7chicago.com

The hot sauce bottle was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach, according to a New York Post story confirmed by Chicago police. The Post claimed they found it near the foot of a stairwell to the Loews.

However, CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: “It’s unclear if that is related to the incident as it was not discovered during any of the earlier canvasses but we took it for analysis. The FBI is providing CPD with technical assistance on this case at our request. I’m not sure if the bottle went to their lab or one of ours.”

Jussie or his peeps wanted to use the last of their hot sauce on their Subway hoagie before putting in a bit of bleach and dropping off the bottle.

BTW, picture this amusing sequence: You’re walking down the street and you see a bottle of Frank’s Red Hot lying at the bottom of a stairwell (that would be below street/sidewalk level, by the way). So you trudge down the steps to examine this find more carefully. The piece of street detritus is so fascinating you pick it up and smell it carefully (wouldn’t anyone?). Voila! You detect a “smell like bleach.”

Obvious criminal evidence! You get the coppers NYPost immediately!

Just a good citizen, carrying out his duty to closely examine every bit of garbage, refuse, and detritus in all the stairwells along your daily stroll. As does everybody."

Blige and Jessica Mulroney as guests for the February 14 “Good Morning America.”

They will not be the only celebrities to appear.

The episode will also feature an interview with Jussie Smollett.

Robin Roberts filmed said interview with the “Empire” star earlier this week. The discussion will mark Smollett’s first formal interview since reporting an assault in late January.

Smollett told police that he was attacked by two men in Chicago on January 29. The assault, as it was reported to authorities, included elements of a hate crime.

Police continue to investigate the matter. Smollett recently submitted phone records to assist with the investigation (he was allegedly on the phone with his manager at the onset of the attack), but a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department says the material turned over was “insufficient to corroborate some of the information.”

The Smollett camp responded by noting that any redactions in the record were designed to protect high-profile individuals not involved in this particular matter.

The statement, moreover, declares, “Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible.”

Smollett has told police that on Jan. 29 he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street about 2 a.m. when two people walked up to him, yelled the slurs, hit him in the face, poured a substance — suspected to be bleach — on him, and put a “thin, light rope” around his neck.

Smollett initially was “reluctant” to call police because of the attention he would generate as a public figure, police said. But his manager eventually called at 2:42 a.m., about 40 minutes after the attack.

The actor said he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack. His manager has said that he could hear the attack and was able to hear the phrase “MAGA country” — the acronym from President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. On Monday he gave the police redacted phone records; he has declined to turn over his phone.

Internet sleuths have cast aspersions on Smollett’s story since it was first reported, and an incomplete phone log may do little, if anything, to quell those doubts.

Smollet said in the interview to air Thursday that the “attacks” on his credibility after the incident have been hard to take.

He originally thought “if I tell the truth, that’s it, because it’s the truth. Oh, how can you doubt that?” he said. But then he realized many “don’t even want to see the truth.”

He also said he believes the images of two people that were seen on surveillance cameras the night of the attack are the ones who attacked him. Police have called them “persons of interest.”

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.” Why is he so sure? “Cause … I was there.”

Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said earlier this month that Smollett has been cooperative with detectives, and that the department is making progress in its investigation.

“We have no reason to think he’s not being genuine with us,” Johnson said. “The allegations that are described to us are horrendous, horrible and quite frankly cowardly. He is a victim, and we treat him like a victim.”

On Tuesday, after Chicago Police said the phone records that the actor had turned over were “insufficient for a criminal investigation,” representatives for Smollett issued a statement to reiterate that “Jussie is the victim here.”

“Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” Chris Bastardi, a spokesman for Smollett, said in an emailed statement. “Superintendent [Eddie] Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”"

The Empire actor spoke to ABC's Robin Roberts for an interview that will air on Good Morning America on Thursday morning.

In a brief promo for the interview, he is seen tearing up after Roberts asked him if he feared for his life at any point during the attack.

In a second teaser released later on Wednesday, the actor hit out at the mountain of questions that have come his way since.

'Then it became a thing of like, ""Oh, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that. It's the truth.""

'And then it became a thing of like, ""Oh. It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth,' he said.

It is the first time the 36-year-old himself will answer questions on camera about the incident which shocked the nation and has brought an avalanche of both sympathy and scrutiny Smollett's way.

In the initial aftermath of the attack, Smollett received an outpouring of support from celebrities and fans alike who all condemned the discrimination he was subjected to.

But in the weeks since, details of the incident have been picked over forensically.

Some of his neighbors have expressed skepticism that it happened the way he said it did and the lack of evidence has done nothing to quell their cynicism.

Despite finding video of Smollett before and after the attack, police have not been able to uncover any surveillance footage of the actual incident and they have not been able to identify the suspects.

They released an initial image of two men walking near Smollett on the night of the incident at around the same time but that led to nothing.

Last week, police discovered a Chilli Habanero hot sauce bottle which seemed to contain bleach (above). It was found near where Smollett says he was attacked and had bleach poured on him . It was found 10 days after the attack

They have also pointed out repeatedly that Smollett did not immediately turn over his phone records or his phone to prove that he was on a call with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, when the attack took place as claimed.

It carries special significance because Moore claims to have heard the attackers calling Smollett 'Empire f****t n****r' and shouting: 'This is MAGA country!'

Within the first few days of the attack, he gave an interview to Variety saying he had heard the slurs but he has not spoken about it since.

On Monday, Smollett finally did hand over his records but they were redacted.

Chicago Police Department described them as 'insufficient proof' of the call.

The actor angrily responded that via a representative that he was never told as much and that they were redacted to protect 'personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.'

In a statement to DailyMail.com on Tuesday night, a spokesman for the actor said: 'Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police.

Once it was over, they clapped and commented to one another about how good the movie had been. “That was the best film I’ve seen in years!” one woman said as she walked out with a smile on her face.

I could understand why.

Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are wonderful. As a white driver, Frank Vallelonga, known as Tony Lip, and his black employer, the composer and musician Don Shirley, in the 1962 South, they have genuine chemistry that plays like a Miles Davis solo with a Cannonball Adderley accompaniment. At the end of the film, Frank’s journey from racist to respectful employee is convincing.

There have been plenty of objections to the movie, which is up for five Oscars, including best picture, at the Academy Awards on Feb. 24. There’s the simplistic way it portrays race and its decision to tell the story exclusively through the eyes of a white person, Vallelonga, learning to see the humanity of a black one. I, too, was troubled by these flaws, but what bothered me most was a scene that almost no one is talking about — and everyone should be.

About halfway through the film, Shirley is arrested at a Y.M.C.A. in Memphis. The police have caught him having sex with a man we have never seen before and do not see or hear from again. The scene comes as a shock: Shirley has been largely solo most of the film, and there is no indication until then that he is either gay (indeed, there is mention of a past marriage to a woman) or bisexual. After a few tense moments, the situation is resolved (as many situations are in this movie) with Tony Lip saving the day. He pays off the police officers, but Shirley is hardly grateful and chides his driver: Tony is “rewarding” the officers for treating the men in such an inhumane way … and that’s it. It is never brought up again."

According to the Blast, Jussie Smollett is telling all during an interview that will air during Good Morning America on Thursday. The Empire star is seen getting emotional and fighting back tears as he speaks with the morning show host about the night he was attacked in an alleged hate crime.

In a promo for the interview, Smollett is seen getting animated with his hand movements as she explains what he went through that night in Chicago. He also appears to break down when Roberts asks him if he feared for his life during the attack.

Although Jussie, his reps, co-stars, and his family have also spoken out about the incident since it occurred last month, this will be the first time that the actor goes in depth about what really happened that night, when he claims he was the victim in an attack that was racially charged and homophobic in nature.

As many fans will remember, Smollett says he was walking the streets of Chicago in the wee hours of the morning in late January when two men gained his attention by yelling out racist and homophobic slurs to him.

Jussie says that the two assailants covered their faces with ski masks and poured a chemical substance on him. They then began to hit him with their hands and even tied a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene of the crime.

Since that time, Jussie Smollett has been working with the police in hopes of finding the men who did this to him. He even turned over his phone records to cops so that they could double check his story about being on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack.

However, when he turned over the records, police claimed that they were “heavily redacted,” causing controversy among fans.

Smollett’s rep then released a statement revealing that the actor provided the necessary phone records and that anything that was redacted was to protect the privacy of Jussie’s contacts.

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack. Chicago Police have not told us that they are rejecting any records, nor have they expressed concerns about the records to us. Therefore, we don’t feel compelled to be bated into responding to uncorroborated press reports. We are dealing directly with the Chicago Police Department,” Smollett’s rep said in the statement.

Roberts flew to Chicago on Tuesday for the interview, the network said, and the interview will air on Thursday morning’s show.

On Jan. 29, Smollett told Chicago police that two men attacked him while yelling racial and homophobic slurs and referencing “MAGA.” A police statement said chemicals were poured on the “Empire” star’s face, and a rope placed around his neck.

But Chicago Police Department say he was slow to turn over material pertinent to the investigation. Police had asked for Smollett’s phone records because he said he was on a call with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, during the attack.

On January 31, two days after the incident CPD said that detectives “were not able to independently verify the statements as cell phone records were not provided to investigators when asked. Therefore we are not able to confirm this.”

Smollett did eventually turn over his phone records. But CPD rejected them, saying they were heavily redacted.

A Chicago police spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said in a statement: “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

On Tuesday, Smollett’s publicists pushed back on CPD’s statement, saying that the actor was only trying to protect the privacy of personal contacts.”

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” his reps said in a statement.

Reps for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Jussie Smollett has given his first interview since he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

The ""Empire"" star sat down with Robin Roberts for an interview that will air on Thursday on ""Good Morning America."" In the first promo for the interview, Smollett can be seen in tears as he talks to Roberts.

On Tuesday night, a rep for Smollett responded to comments made by the police that the phone records he turned over were ""limited and heavily redacted.""

His rep said in a statement, ""Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie's attackers and bring them to justice.""

The rep continued, ""Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack. Chicago Police have not told us that they are rejecting any records, nor have they expressed concerns about the records to us. Therefore, we don't feel compelled to be bated into responding to uncorroborated press reports. We are dealing directly with the Chicago Police Department.""

The “Empire” star had told police he was on the phone with his manager on January 29 when the alleged attack occurred.

Smollett made his first public appearance earlier this month at a performance in West Hollywood, California, which came just days after the alleged attack.

In addressing the attack, Smollett told the crowd, ""I had to be here tonight y'all. I couldn’t let those motherf**kers win.""

Chicago PD released a photo of the potential suspects, which showed two men wearing dark clothing. Detectives are reviewing more cameras but are looking to question the two individuals seen in the photo.

Police say the two people were seen walking near the location of the incident between 1:30 AM and 1:45 AM and are trying to determine if they witnessed the incident, or were possibly involved.

It will be his first time talking to a journalist directly about being the victim of a possible hate crime in Chicago last week. Smollett was hospitalized and treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago after the attack.

TMZ originally reported the attack happened when Smollett, was leaving a Subway and someone yelled, “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n*****?” The 2 men — both white and wearing ski masks — viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett spoke about the attack on him for the first time at a performance at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on Saturday night.

Frank Gatson, the man who was with Smollett the night of the attack, spoke out last week in an interview with Extra.

Said Gatson: “I was there with Jussie. I’m the one who called 911, I am the one who took him to the hospital, and it was so scary, man, that was a scary night — my stomach was numb. I’m just glad I was the old man at his apartment when he got there, I was responsible. I said, ‘Let’s call the cops, let’s go to the hospital.’ Shout out to Chicago police, especially the sergeant that came and got things together and made us feel comfortable…Jussie is a very strong guy.”

Smollett turned over phone records to the Chicago Police on Monday in relation to the alleged. But, according to the police, the records are insufficient.

The Chicago Tribune reports: “Investigators had sought Smollett’s phone records since shortly after he reported the attack Jan. 29 in the 300 block of East North Water Street. But police described Smollett’s phone records as a heavily redacted document file and his manager’s records as a screenshot of phone calls that provide limited information to investigators. Chief police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said police were “appreciative” of Smollett’s cooperation in providing the records but said detectives will likely need additional data from Smollett to crack the case.”

The comments of the CPD were interpreted as them casting doubt on Smollett’s claim.

CNN’s Don Lemon, a friend of Smollett’s told Jada Pinkett Smith on her show Red Table Talk, that he checks in with the Empire actor frequently: “Lemon said that he knew everyone would be picking Smollett’s story apart and that the details are not really his concern. Instead, he said, he was interested in Smollett’s “well-being.” He texts him daily to check in, because he believes he can relate very well to his situation, as a gay, black man in the spotlight. “Sometimes he responds, sometimes he doesn’t,” he said of Smollett, adding that he seems to appreciate the concern.”

Roberts who is also Black and gay is ideally suited to navigate the waters of an interview that could be potentially disturbing and contain more revelations as the investigation continues."

Smollett’s representatives issued a statement a day after police said the heavily redacted phone records he turned over to detectives this week were insufficient for a criminal investigation.

The statement is the latest in a back-and-forth between Smollett and police since he reported the attack in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Police have made no arrests and said they have found no surveillance video that shows the attack. They have released video of two people in the area at the time who they said were persons of interest.

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,” the statement said. “Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.”

But Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Monday that the phone records turned over by Smollett are in a heavily redacted document file and the records from the manager Smollett says he was talking to when the attack occurred were a screenshot of phone calls. He says the records aren’t sufficient for an investigation.

Smollett’s statement said he had good reasons for turning over limited information.

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” his statement said.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before and looped a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck. Smollett also told detectives that before they ran off, the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country, ” a reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan President Donald Trump uses.

Smollett and his family have insisted that he has been truthful about the attack and his story has not changed since it happened.

Police have collected video surveillance footage from cameras in the downtown area and have also extended their search to stores in the area in the hopes of gathering evidence on who might have purchased the rope.

“There’s a black tax,” Jones said at Lifetime’s “Unmute Her: A Conversation on Lifting Up the Voices of Women” event Tuesday in Los Angeles. “In a film, things cost the same amount but somehow we get less money to make the film because we should be grateful to be there.”

As a part of its Broader Focus and Stop Violence Against Women Initiatives, Lifetime brought together women behind the scenes such as Jones, as well as “Empire” writers and producers JaNeika James and JaSheika James, Kronicle Media co-founders Korin Williams and Monique Nash, writer Kasuba Mukuka, UCLA Professor Dr. Aparna Sharma, and psychotherapist and author Stacy Kaiser.

Nash noted that it isn’t enough for those creating content to be diverse, but also the executives who are the gatekeepers to getting that content made, as well.

“A lot of times [Korin and I] go in rooms, we’re selling [and] pitching projects to people that don’t look like us,” she said. “So, there is sometimes a lack of understanding of what we’re pitching. Then, we’re being told the stories that we’re pitching are not authentic because it’s not an expected experience of what their preconceived ideas are.”

Williams echoed her creative partner’s sentiments, adding, “You’re educating at the same time you’re trying to sell a deal.”

The panelists pointed to Mukuka as an example of giving new, female writers the opportunity to pitch their ideas. Mukuka is an executive assistant in Lifetime’s movie department and is receiving support from the network to develop a script she wrote about the domestic violence in Zambia. Mukuka is originally from the African country and is using her knowledge and understanding of the culture to write a short that will be produced this spring.

The importance of understanding was further emphasized as the James sisters spoke about the recent alleged hate crime against “Empire” star Jussie Smollett. JaSheika James wore a sweatshirt with Smollett’s picture on it to show her support. JaNeika James said the event “completely rocked and horrified our entire community.” She added that the show’s current fifth season is too far along to address Smollett’s alleged attack, but that it is possible the issue could be a storyline in a future season.

“We do work to kind of address some of these issues…We have in past episodes,” JaNeika James said, noting the story they did in Season 3 when Tiana’s friend was punched in the face in a club. “We’ll see what happens going forward.”"

But she could just as easily be describing herself.

For the first 12 years of Page’s career, she was – as she later put it – “very, very, very closeted”. She was still only 17 when she starred in the harrowing revenge thriller Hard Candy (2005), and hadn’t come out to herself yet, much less the world. She still hadn’t in 2007, when she landed an Oscar nomination for her wonderful, wry performance as a pregnant teenager in Juno. A little while later, she started dating women – but at the same time as she was starring in films such as Whip It (2009), Inception (2010) and X-Men: Days of Future Past (2013), she was making her girlfriends leave buildings through different exits, or hide in hotel bathrooms when room service came.

Then, on Valentine’s Day 2014 – five years ago to the day – the Canadian actor made a speech at a Human Rights Campaign conference. After praising the work of the organisation, and condemning pervasive stereotypes about masculinity and femininity, she took a deep, anxious breath. “I am here today because I am gay,” she announced. “And because maybe I can make a difference.” Over the past half a decade, she’s more than lived up to that tentative promise – and got in touch with her own rage in the process.

Case in point: the 31-year-old’s viral appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert this month, seen by more than 16 million people. A few days earlier, Empire actor Jussie Smollett was attacked by two people reportedly shouting racist, homophobic slurs. Page wanted to address it. “This is what happens, if you are in a position of power and you hate people,” she said, calling out US vice president Mike Pence by name, her hand pulling on an invisible thread as she spoke. “You spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is gonna happen? Kids are gonna be abused, and they’re gonna kill themselves.” There was a stagnant pause. “And people are gonna be beaten on the street.” It was so far removed from the usual celebrity talk show fluff, you could practically hear the air leave the room.

“It just sort of… happened,” says Page now, as she perches cautiously on the sofa of a London hotel room. Dressed all in black, she has a nervous energy about her. Later in our conversation, she’ll unleash the same righteous anger she showed on Colbert, and her entire demeanour will transform – but for now, she sits with a carefulness that feels almost brittle, her hands slightly shaking.

It’s this side of herself that Page channels, at least at first, in The Umbrella Academy, a 10-episode adaptation of Gerard Way and Gabriel Bá’s comic book series. Page plays Vanya, one of a number of people born – on the same day in 1989 – to women who showed no signs of pregnancy in the days prior. Eccentric billionaire Sir Reginald Hargreeves adopts seven of these children, including Vanya, and raises them in a strict, loveless household, training them to fight crime. Of all her “siblings”, though, Vanya is the only one who seems to possess no superpowers. Told there is “just nothing special” about her by her adoptive father, she grows into a shy, lonely woman, terrified of taking up too much space in the world.

“Ultimately, she’s a person who had this really abusive childhood, you know?” says Page. “Her father was horrible to her, the children were horrible to her, and now she’s existing in her early 30s and really can barely cope. She is depressed, she is anxious, she barely even knows how to have a friendship, let alone an intimate relationship, and she’s struggling with these feelings of complete and utter worthlessness. That whole arc in general was like, ‘yes please’. I immediately related to Vanya.”

Because of the secret she was carrying around, Page too struggled with intimate relationships for a long time. “I mean, I barely touched a woman outside until I was 27 years old,” she says. She shakes her head. “Crazy.” It must have been a relief when she came out. “Oh, enormous relief,” she says. “And, I wasn’t OK, physically, at the time. I had a lot of physical stuff that was happening. I was very susceptible to panic attacks. And coming out, like,” she clicks her fingers, “it was as if I transformed overnight.”

Page has been married to the dancer Emma Portner for just over a year now, but her firsthand knowledge of the damage repression can do is why she’s so incensed by intolerance. She balks at the idea that those with differing ideologies should try to get along. “There is one side that is right, and there is one side that is wrong,” she says. “Gay marriage... it’s not a debate. Whether you have the religious right to f***ing not serve a queer person or a trans person, that’s not a debate. And the media needs to stop treating it like it’s a debate.” That nervous energy has vanished. “It’s actually Not. A. Debate. It never has been. Like... Stop it.” She says that last part vehemently, then says it again. “Stop it.” She’s still saying it when I try to ask another question. “Literally… stop!” she shouts, then seeing my startled face says, “No, not you!”

The way Page sees it, there is a direct, irrefutable link between anti-LGBT+ politics, and actual physical violence. “I’ve met people who have dealt with the most brutal f***ing trauma because of the rhetoric and policies that are promoted by people in power,” she says, “and it’s absolutely devastating. And I think people would know that more if we had more representation of LGBTQ people in the media. Because I have first-hand examples from Gaycation,” she adds, referring to the documentary series in which she and best friend Ian Daniel explore queer communities around the world. “I’ve had phone calls that really surprised me, sadly, people being like, ‘I feel so bad for how I’ve treated people, the things I’ve said. I will never do it again.’ This real absorption of like, ‘Oh my God, when I was calling that kid a faggot in high school...’ Really sitting with what that meant.”

It’s interesting, I say, that people felt the need to get in touch to tell her about past acts of bigotry. Are they apologising, or hoping to be exonerated? Is there merit to simply owning up to past prejudices? Liam Neeson recently admitted, in an interview with this publication, that he had once roamed the streets, after a close friend was raped, looking for a “black bastard” to kill – but he insisted that he was ashamed of it. “Well,” says Page, “if you wanna own up to that, yeah, but you’re acknowledging that that’s f***ing... so f***ing, beyond f***ing.... it’s just so f***ing racist. And so you can say it, and own up to it, but then you have to prepare for the response people are gonna give you. We can own up to things and say sorry – we can’t just assume we’ll be forgiven. And you can’t be doing it with that expectation, because then that’s not really a true apology. Yeah. It’s hard to know how to have f***ing words for that conversation to be honest. I’ll be honest. That’s so f***ed.”

As for Mike Pence: she would much rather he had kept his bigotry to himself. “If he wants to go home, and while he’s making breakfast in the morning, be thinking about how much he hates gay people, and doesn’t want them to be f***ing happy, be in your head with that,” she shrugs. “But if you’re growing up in a society where it’s [OK] to be having a conversation about whether the rights of LGBTQ people exist or not... if a kid is growing up in a homophobic household, that is an abusive household. Full stop. It’s just flat out wrong, and I think that needs to start getting across, and people need to know that there’s really disastrous consequences. I’m not making those up.” A few days after we meet, Page is back on the warpath, calling out Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt for attending an “infamously anti-LGBTQ” church. “If you are a famous actor and you belong to an organisation that hates a certain group of people,” she tweets, “don’t be surprised if someone simply wonders why it’s not addressed.”

It’s clear that Page never wants to repress herself – or her rage – again. “This is f***ing life or death for people,” she tells me. “It’s life or death. And that’s not an exaggeration.”

A spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department told ET on Tuesday that detectives rejected the cell phone records the Empire star submitted via PDF one day earlier because they were heavily redacted.

According to police, a PDF is subject to manipulation, but they are not saying they have any evidence that Smollett manipulated his phone records -- detectives have now asked Smollett to submit his actual phone bill or a download of his entire phone. Police also told ET that detectives had recently obtained surveillance video from stores in the area where the attack happened to see if anyone bought rope around the time the incident occurred.

As the investigation continues, Smollett is still cooperating with detectives, and authorities are continuing to treat the actor as the victim of a hate crime, the spokesperson added.

A source previously told ET that Smollett was walking around Chicago in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, when two men started yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, before repeatedly hitting him. The men then poured a substance on him -- believed to be bleach, according to the source -- and one of the attackers put a rope around his neck.

The Chicago Police Department claims they previously asked Smollett for his phone in an effort to corroborate certain details from his accounting of the incident, which includes him being on the phone with his talent manager, Brandon Z. Moore, when the attack occurred.

Smollett released a statement on Feb. 1 addressing the attack. The following day, he appeared on stage at his West Hollywood show at The Troubadour, telling fans that he was going to ""stand strong.""

Roberts flew to Chicago on Tuesday for the interview, the network said, and the interview will air on Thursday morning’s show.

On Jan. 29, Smollett told Chicago police that two men attacked him while yelling racial and homophobic slurs and referencing “MAGA.” A police statement said chemicals were poured on the “Empire” star’s face, and a rope placed around his neck. No arrests have been made in the case.

But Chicago Police Department have said the star of Fox’s “Empire” was slow to turn over material pertinent to the investigation. Police had asked for Smollett’s phone records because he said he was on a call with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, during the attack.

On January 31, two days after the incident, CPD said that detectives “were not able to independently verify the statements as cell phone records were not provided to investigators when asked. Therefore we are not able to confirm this.”

Smollett did eventually turn over his phone records. But Chicago police said they were too heavily redacted to be useful to their investigation. A Chicago police spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said in a statement: “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

On Tuesday, Smollett’s publicists pushed back, saying that the actor was only trying to protect “the privacy of personal contacts.”

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” his reps said in a statement.

Reps for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before looping what police said was a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck.

Smollett also told detectives that before they ran off, the attackers yelled “This is Maga country”, a reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan President Donald Trump uses.

Police have collected video surveillance footage from cameras in the central area and have also extended their search to stores in the area in the hopes of gathering evidence on who might have purchased the rope.

Actor Jussie Smollett has reportedly turned over his phone records to law enforcement officials, nearly two weeks after he was allegedly beaten in a racist, homophobic attack, but police reportedly need even more information from him.

The 35-year-old “Empire” star told Chicago police that he was assaulted by two strangers after leaving a Subway restaurant at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He claimed that the two men, who have yet to be identified or apprehended, used racist and homophobic slurs before beating him, dousing him with what may have been bleach, and leaving a noose around his neck.

Initial reports from TMZ suggested that Smollett told police that he was on the phone with his manager when he was attacked, but he later opted not to give his phone or records to police when requested to. An unnamed source close to the actor later contested that claim to TMZ, claiming that Smollett was “uncomfortable” being without his phone and police never asked for his phone records. Still, Smollett had agreed to share his records, the source claimed.

Chicago police confirmed on Monday that Smollett has turned over his phone records to police, but they may still need more from him, the Chicago Tribune reports. The records Smollett handed over “are not sufficient and do not meet the burden of a criminal investigation,” police said, according to the outlet.

Smollett’s camp also confirmed that the records have been given to police, with a spokesperson for the actor telling Page Six on Monday, “Phone records from Jussie’s manager were sent to police on Feb. 5 and Jussie’s records were sent over this morning. Both were sent to Chief of Staff to the Superintendent of Police Robert Boik, who confirmed receipt.”

“They have Jussie’s records from within an hour of the incident. The police confirmed receipt of the records at [2:28 p.m. EST],” the statement continued.

However, police said that the document Smollett gave to police contained multiple redacted portions, while his manager’s records were a screenshot of a call log, according to the Chicago Tribune. Chief police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the outlet that while police are “appreciative” of Smollett cooperating with authorities, they will likely need more information.

Police would like to review the phone records so that they can verify Smollett's story as well as his manager's version of events, Page Six reports.

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Guglielmi told the outlet.

Smollett told police that his attackers said, “This is MAGA country,” as they fled, and the actor is said to have transported himself to a local hospital following the attack. Police are currently investigating the incident, and have released surveillance footage of two people who they believe are people of interest in the case. As of yet, however, no suspects have been named and no arrests have been made.

While some on social media (and in his neighborhood) have questioned his story, Smollett has maintained that he has consistently cooperated with police.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in the first statement he issued following the alleged attack. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

A spokesperson from the Chicago Police Department said on Tuesday that the phone records the 'Empire' actor provided were ""insufficient to corroborate some of the information.”

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama 'Empire,' performed in West Hollywood less than a week after he reported to Chicago police that he was attacked in January by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck.

""The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I'm okay. I'm not fully healed yet, but I'm going to be and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all,"" the 36-year-old actor and R&B performer told a crowd of hundreds of cheering fans, according to media reports.

News of the alleged assault sparked outrage on social media, but some questioned Smollett's account as the Chicago police have not found video evidence."

On Monday, February 11, police officer Christine Calace informed Us Weekly the Chicago Police Department had “received limited and redacted phone records from the victim.”

The following day, however, police officer Michael Carroll told Us that the investigators may require more records from Smollett. “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation. However, the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” he said. “Detectives may be following up with the victim to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.”

In another development in the case, a New York Post reporter found a hot sauce bottle while retracing the path the Empire star took around 2 a.m. on January 29. That’s when Smollett was allegedly approached by two attackers who poured a bleach-smelling liquid on him and put a noose around his neck while yelling racist and homophobic slurs.

The Chicago Police Department later confirmed that the bottle was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach, but CPD Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi couldn’t say for certain whether the liquid was used against Smollett.

“It’s unclear if that is related to the incident as it was not discovered during any of the earlier canvasses but we took it for analysis,” Guglielmi said in a statement to Us.

Guglielmi previously told Us in a statement that police “located a surveillance camera that shows potential persons of interest wanted for questioning in reference to the assault and battery” of Smollett. And on Monday, February 6, a source confirmed to Us that the “Hurt People” singer had returned to work on the set of Empire.

The actor’s representatives also recently responded to claims he may be lying about his attack with a written statement.

UPDATE (11:50 a.m. EST): Smollett will give his first televised interview following his attack to Good Morning America on Thursday. Below is a clip of the Empire star speaking with Robin Roberts.

ORIGINAL: Weeks after Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by racist and homophobic assailants, representatives from his camp are responding to rumors and social media criticism that the Empire actor might be lying.

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,” the statement provided to Out reads. “Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible.”

Smollett alleged he had just returned to Chicago early January 29 when around 2 a.m. he left his home to get something to eat from Subway. Upon being recognized as “that faggot Empire n*****?,” sources told TMZ, Smollett was assaulted by two men who poured a clear liquid on him, believed to be bleach, and put his head in a noose. Police confirmed that Smollett said his attackers yelled ""MAGA country"" as they attacked him.

After reporting the incident to police and conducting an initial interview with them, Smollett went to the hospital. Though bruised, he was not admitted and returned home.

A video of Smollett with a rope around his neck returning to his building after the reported incident has been recovered by the police but has yet to be released, according to The Advocate. Local police say they will not release this footage until the investigation in finished.

Police have said they are investigating the incident as a “possible hate crime.” On January 31, they released photos of two “persons of interest.”

The statement from Smollett’s camp comes after the actor-singer turned over phone records that police said were “limited and heavily redacted.” In their report, The Advocate said that the records “have been rejected by local police,” as a result. CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that “detectives may be following up … to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.”

Smollett’s team contends that any redacted information was done to “protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

According to ABC7 Chicago, Smollett’s representatives said that ""Chicago Police have not told us that they are rejecting any records, nor have they expressed concerns about the records to us. Therefore, we don't feel compelled to be bated into responding to uncorroborated press reports.”

Read the full statement to Out below:

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police. Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.

Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

A CPD spokesperson said yesterday that the phone records Smollett provided were ""insufficient to corroborate some of the information.” Smollett and his team took offense at the idea that he wasn't giving the police everything that they needed to help find the people who attacked him last month.

""Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police.

""Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.""

While representatives admitted that some information may have been redacted on phone records provided by Smollett, they said that those numbers were not germane to the attack.

""Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,"" they said. ""Chicago Police have not told us that they are rejecting any records, nor have they expressed concerns about the records to us. Therefore, we don’t feel compelled to be baited into responding to uncorroborated press reports.""

Smollett recently performed for the first time since he was attacked. He took the stage at West Hollywood's Troubadour.

""The most important thing that I can say is to keep it simple and say thank you and I’m okay,"" Smollett said. ""I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to and I’m going to stand strong with you all. I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let those motherf*ckers win."""

(Article by Tom Elliott republished from News.Grabien.com)

To quickly recap: Smollett, an openly gay actor and musician who stars in the Fox show, “Empire,” recently claimed he was the victim of a horrific hate crime perpetuated by Trump-supporting thugs. Besides acting, Smollett is well known for being an outspoken critic of President Trump.

According to the account relayed to the celebrity gossip site, TMZ, Smollett was attacked upon leaving a Chicago Subway sandwich shop around 2 AM. The masked attackers, he says, recognized him, hurled racial and homophobic epithets at him (”Empire f*gg*t n*gger!”), beat him up, tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him, and said triumphantly, “This is MAGA Country!”

The original report said his rib was broken in the attack and he was recovering in a hospital. Smollett also told police that in the days before the attack, he received a death threat in the mail. That letter was signed “MAGA,” the same thing he says his attackers yelled. The letter itself used letters from magazines to conceal the sender’s handwriting:

News of the attack immediately went viral, and celebrities worldwide used the incident to denounce what they described as growing intolerance of minorities.

But as people clamored for more information, Smollett started clamming up. The Chicago Police Department opened an investigation, with an assist from the FBI, only to find the actor extremely uncooperative. What evidence they did turn up only served to undermine Smollett’s story.

During a performance at Chicago’s Troubadour Theater days after the attack, Smollett read a prepared statement acknowledging parts of his original story were untrue. Smollett admitted his ribs were not actually broken and that he never went to the hospital.

“A couple of points I wanted to make really quick; just because — four points,” he said before performing an encore. “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately, my friend Gatson [sp?] drove me. I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in LA and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take care obviously. But above all, I fought the f*ck back.”

Investigators also failed to locate any evidence corroborating Smollett’s claims. Security footage reviewed by the Chicago Police Department show a gap where the actor was walking, disappeared from camera, and returned one minute later with a noose around his neck. For an attack as brutal as Smollett described, this is a very small time window for so much to have occurred.

The Chicago Police Department say security footage show the actor returning to his apartment still clutching the Subway sandwich he had bought before the incident, which many found surprising since he had just apparently undergone a horrific ordeal in which he “fought the f*ck back” against racist thugs. That his attackers happened to randomly run into him at 2 AM while carrying the perfect accessories for an anti-black hate crime — bleach and a noose — also struck many as odd, especially as a cold spell meant Chicago temperatures were well below zero that night.

Chicago police say they will be requesting more phone records from “Empire” star Jussie Smollett regarding the racist and homophobic attack he allegedly faced two weeks ago. Smollett has turned over heavily redacted phone records, but evidence has begun to emerge suggesting his story was fabricated. Rumors are swirling that police are even considering charging him with filing a false report.

{snip}

Weigel had previously reported that the police superintendent plans to hold Smollett accountable if the investigation reveals he made a false report. “[Chicago Police Superintendent] Eddie Johnson says [Jussie Smollett] is still being treated as the victim in this case but if the investigation does reveal he made a false report he will be held accountable,” he tweeted. That threat seems more likely.

Late Monday evening, ABC7 Chicago reported that an empty hot sauce bottle that smelled like bleach was found near the location of the alleged attack. Smollett had told police that the attackers — who wore “Make America Great Again” hats and screamed “This is MAGA country!” — had poured an unknown bleach-smelling liquid on him and put a noose around his neck after they yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him at 2 a.m. on January 29.

{snip}

As for the phone records, Guglielmi said, “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation, however, the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted. Detectives may be following up with him to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.”

Chicago police have not been able to identify any legitimate suspects in the case, nor have they been able to find any surveillance footage of the attack. There is speculation that the hot sauce bottle may have been placed after the fact to prop up the hoax if Smollett indeed made a false report.

{snip}

Many Americans are waking up to the possibility that Jussie Smollett’s story may be a hoax. Jeff Giesea, an entrepreneur who has written for NATO and the Harvard Business Review, tweeted, “The weight of evidence supports what we’ve suspected all along: This is a hate hoax. [Jussie Smollett] should be arrested for filing a false police report & sued. In this era of disinfo, these hoaxes and their media enablers must be held accountable.”

Conservative blogger Matt Walsh laid out the basic incongruity of Smollett’s story: “he claims he was attacked by white Trump-loving racists in one of the most liberal parts of one of the most liberal cities in America. No similar attacks have been reported by anyone in the town.”

Quillette’s Andy Ngo noted that the very person who said he could hear the attackers over the phone himself refused to let police examine the phone."

She was one of the biggest winners featured on the nearly four-hour show.

And through the fame and the fortune, Nicki Minaj still has not forgotten about her roots

As the 32-year-old singer came on stage to accept her first award of the night she made sure to thank one of the most special people in her life in person as the rapper was joined by her mother Carol Maraj at the 2015 BET Awards.

The Starships hitmaker had a good sense of humour about the flub as she laughed about it and ended her acceptance speech with a positive message to all her fans.

Nicki along with Chris Brown are the most nominated performers, with six nods apiece, making them the artists to beat across board in the music categories.

P. Diddy made his first public appearance since his arrest earlier in the week on Monday for an altercation with his son's college football coach.

But his return to the limelight may have not gone as expected as he took a tumble during his performance.

The 45-year-old rapper was joined by several artists on his Bad Boy Records company to celebrate the 20th anniversary for the label but took an unexpected fall in the middle of the stage show.

He was also joined on stage by several rappers and singers from the label including: Mase, 112, Lil Kim, Faith Evans and even Khloe Kardashian's on/off beau French Montana.

While performing hit track It's All About The Benjamins (Remix), Diddy jaunted across the stage to make way for rapper Jadakiss when he fell straight on his backside due to a hole on the platform. He did make a quick recovery as he got up and continued with the medley.

That was not his only flub of the night as he stumbled on his words while presenting legendary crooner Smokey Robinson with the Lifetime Achievement Award.

After gathering himself, the rapper -real name Sean Combs - asked production to bring the teleprompter back to the beginning of the speech because he wanted to 'do it right for Smokey'.

Chris Brown was busy throughout the event as well as he performed a medley of hits in the first hour of the award show. The 26-year-old crooner opened up with his new track liquor.

The music stopped abruptly as he performed hit Ayo and brought out Kylie Jenner's rumoured boyfriend Tyga before Omarion came out to close the performance with Post To Be.

Of course there is always drama with any awards show, which often forces celebrities with longstanding rivalries and / or romantic histories to interact as they celebrate the best and brightest in their industries.

At one point during Chris's performance the 27-year-old beauty from Barbados was spotted singing along to his latest hit with Omarion.

Brown took home the prize as a solo artist for best male R&B/pop artist as she was also nominated for his collaborations with Lil Wayne and Tyga, and with Usher and Rick Ross.

Golden girl: Rihanna took the stage at the BET Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday night

Trouble: The 27-year-old singer was at the event to introduce a short clip from her upcoming music video for B**** Better Have My Money

She was all business at the event as she rocked a golden suit jacket while introducing a short teaser clip from her upcoming music video for B**** Better Have My Money.

One difference between Rihanna's look and traditional business-casual is that the singer showed off plenty of cleavage as she rocked the jacket with no top on underneath.

Along with the jacket she wore a matching gold mini skirt which showed off her legs while finishing the look with a pair of strappy black heels.

She had her brunette tresses tied back in an elegant ponytail as she sported natural, complimentary make-up on her face finished off with a swipe of shiny lip.

Eye-popping: No doubt she had many attendees in awe as she rocked a shiny gold skirt suit

Showing off: She didn't wear a top underneath the jacket as she proudly displayed plenty of cleavage

Heartfelt: The We Found Love singer gushed about legendary crooner Smokey Robinson, who was being honoured athat night

The We Found Love singer had plenty of jewellery on including a two blinged out necklaces, a blinged out bracelet with large topaz stones and a gaudy diamond ring.

When she hit the stage Rihanna said she was there for two reasons, one being to see Smokey Robinson, who was being honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award.

Her second and biggest reason to be there was to play a clip from the upcoming music video.

What a drag: Rihanna is not seen much in the clip as she is pictured having a smoke

Svelte: A blonde woman could be seen throughout most of the clip as she gets ready for a night out

Chance meeting: The two women enter the same elevator as the blonde woman carries a small dog

Where'd she go? When the elevator doors re-open only Rihanna and the pooch remain

The former girlfriend of Chris Brown was not seen very much in the short video, but instead a rich blonde woman who was getting ready for a night out.

Rihanna could be seen in short bursts, smoking and getting a large luggage out oft the back of her car.

Eventually the two women share an elevator together as the blonde woman carries along her small puppy, when the elevator opens the woman is gone as Rihanna is the one carrying the prized pooch instead.

Karrueche opted to flash her toned midriff in only a semi-sheer bralet. The main statement piece aside, she covered her shoulders and arms in a lightweight sequinned jacket.

The patterned outer wear matched perfectly with the fitted pair of trousers to coordinate her separate pieces.

But the most surprising part of her ensemble was perhaps her lightened locks. Tran chose to transform her tresses into silver locks specifically for the ceremony.

Karrueche dumped the recording artists three months ago after it was revealed he'd fathered a child with another woman.

After splitting with Rihanna in 2009, Brown went on to date Karrueche.

But the two singers reignited their relationship during 2013 before finally splitting for good in the same year.

Chris returned to Karrueche but she dumped him in March when she found out about his baby daughter Loyalty.

Final touches: A makeup artist applied some foundation on her abs

Brown has been persistently pursuing the model in recent weeks and trying to win her back, with no success.

Speaking on Ryan Seacrest's radio show earlier in June, the Only singer said he's doing his best to make up for past mistakes and 'be a man about it.'

Despite reports he was actively trying to win the pinup back, he insisted there's no reunion on the cards.

The R&B artist, 27, was seen already in her seat inside the Microsoft Theatre while her ex Chris Brown, 26, posed for photographs outside.

Her decision comes one week after she and rumored new beau Karim Benzema almost came face to face with Brown at Hollywood nightclub Hooray Henry's.

But Brown's most recent ex Karrueche Tran had no qualms about being seen arriving for the big event and happily posed solo for photographers.

Brown and Rihanna famously had an acrimonious break-up in 2009 after Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault following reports he had beaten the singer.

They later rekindled their romance in 2012 but split for good in 2013.

Solo: Karrueche Tran, 27, who dumped Brown in March, didn't seem to care about possibly encountering her ex on the red caret and showed up in a revealing cropped and transparent bustier

However, it's clear that Rihanna, who, it seems, attended the BET Awards solo, would rather not have to encounter the Loyalty hitmaker.

The same could not be said for Karrueche.

The 27-year-old model obviously didn't worry about possibly bumping into her ex even though she recently issued a very public rebuke to Brown who has been trying unsuccessfully to win her back.

Karrueche dumped the recording artists three months ago after it was revealed he'd fathered a child with another woman.

Rihanna was in good spirits at the award show and even participated in a prank backstage.

The Unapologetic artist was seen on video seeming to lash out at BET President of Programming Stephen Hill and throwing a wad of cash at him before stomping away.

She then went on stage to introduce a teaser clip of her new video for Bitch Better Have My Money.

The video of the incident was shared on Twitter but was clearly a joke staged for the telecast as a grinning Hill was photographed backstage being kissed on the cheek by the singer.

Rihanna is also, it seems, still a fan of Chris Brown - or at least his music.

Us Weekly reported that the Good Girl Gone Bad star was caught on camera during the televised show singing along as Brown performed on stage.

The hip hop artist started with Liquor and then with Tyga joining him, went into Ayso.

Then, as he performed with Omarion and Post to Be, Rihanna was seen dancing in her seat and singing along.

Rihanna and Brown hit the headlines when they first began dating in 2008 but in 2009 their high-profile relationship made news for a very different reason.

An explosive argument between the couple ended with a physical altercation that left the Barbadian beauty hospitalized.

The rapper, then just 19, turned himself in to police and was booked on suspicion of making criminal threats.

He subsequently pleaded guilty to one charge of felony assault in relation the incident and received five years probation.

Following the split, Brown went on to date Karrueche and Rihanna started a romance with baseball star Matt Kemp.

But the former couple reignited their relationship during 2013 before finally splitting for good in 2013.

Who's pursuing who? Brown, 26, has said he's still in love with Karrueche but she's told him to 'man up' and move on

Meanwhile, Rihanna has been spotted in public several times in the past few weeks with Real Madrid soccer star Karim Benzema, 27.

Some of showbiz's most notable singers, actors and models gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday to celebrate another year in entertainment.

The sun was out for the 2016 BET Awards and perfect for parading stylish and barely-there ensembles alike on the red carpet at Microsoft Theater.

Model Karrueche Tran was one of the first stars to arrive looking gorgeous in a fitted black pencil dress with cleavage on show.

BET didn't offer specific details about Sunday's performance; there was no word about which Prince songs would be performed or if the musicians would sing together or separately.

However, the tribute could become the most memorable moment of the show, airing live on BET from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.

The 45-year-old rapper slipped and fell into what appeared to be a hole in the stage while performing during the awards ceremony at the downtown Microsoft Theater.

To make matters worse, later when he presented an award, he flubbed his lines and had to ask the teleprompter to re-wind.

Stage fall: P. Diddy took a tumble on Sunday while performing at the BET Awards in Los Angeles

He took to the stage joined by several artists on his Bad Boy Records company to celebrate the label's 20th anniversary.

He was performing the hit track It's All About The Benjamins (Remix) and jaunted across the stage to make room for rapper Jadakiss.

Diddy was at the front of the stage and was strutting back when he unexpectedly tripped and fell flat on his back.

People close to the stage pushed Diddy from behind to help him get back on his feet.

He recovered quickly and was joined on stage by several rappers and singers from the label including: Mase, 112, Lil Kim, Faith Evans and even Khloe Kardashian's on/off beau French Montana.

The rapper later flubbed his lines while presenting the Lifetime Achievement Award to 75-year-old Smokey Robinson.

He apologized to the crowd after stumbling on his words and said he was 'nervous' due to celebrating 20 years of Bad Boy music.

The rapper gathered himself and asked the production to rewind the teleprompter to the start of the speech because he wanted to 'do it right for Smokey'.

Diddy was arrested last Monday on the UCLA campus after an alleged altercation with the football team's strength coach Sal Alosi at an athletics facility.

His son Justin Combs, 21, plays for the UCLA football team as a defensive back.

Popular artists: Faith Williams joined Diddy onstage during the group performance

The incident occurred after a voluntary practice in which Alosi reportedly kicked Diddy's son off the field during a workout.

Diddy allegedly swung a kettlebell during the altercation in Alosi's office.

Police watched a security video before arresting the music producer.

All-star performance: Lil' Kim also hit the stae with Diddy

Diddy was arrested for investigation of three counts of felony assault with a deadly weapon, one count of making terrorist threats, and one count of battery.

The rap mogul who was freed after posting bail issued a statement saying he only acted in self-defense to protect himself and his son.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office was set to review the case this week for prosecution.

The two also shielded their eyes with sunglasses and showed off their plump pinkish nude pouts.

However, the pair set themselves apart with various shades and shoes.

As Blac wore chunky platform sandals, Amber stuck with stimple open-toe, ankle-strap stilettos.

Smollett’s representatives issued a statement a day after police said the heavily redacted phone records he turned over to detectives this week were insufficient for a criminal investigation.

The statement is the latest in a back-and-forth between Smollett and police since he reported the attack in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Police have made no arrests and said they have found no surveillance video that shows the attack. They have released video of two people in the area at the time who they said were persons of interest.

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,” the statement said. “Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.”

But Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Monday that the phone records turned over by Smollett are in a heavily redacted document file and the records from the manager Smollett says he was talking to when the attack occurred were a screenshot of phone calls. He says the records aren’t sufficient for an investigation.

Smollett’s statement said he had good reasons for turning over limited information.

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” his statement said.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before and looped a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck. Smollett also told detectives that before they ran off, the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country, ” a reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan President Donald Trump uses.

Smollett and his family have insisted that he has been truthful about the attack and his story has not changed since it happened.

Police have collected video surveillance footage from cameras in the downtown area and have also extended their search to stores in the area in the hopes of gathering evidence on who might have purchased the rope.

Chicago Police department told Page Six on Tuesday, that the records the 36-year-old actor provided for the investigation into his alleged attack were “limited and redacted” and “insufficient for a criminal investigation.” (RELATED: Alec Baldwin Arrested For Alleged Assault)

“We need something a little more concrete and direct if we’re going to be able to say for a fact the conversation occurred,” Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told the outlet, in response to records that Smollett had provided 13 days after his alleged attack and in reference to a conversation the actor said he had with his manager during the alleged attack. (RELATED: Man Attacked At Cheesecake Factory For Wearing MAGA Hat Speaks Out)

“We don’t believe this is the case at all, but when anyone hands over a redacted and limited record like a PDF of a phone bill, for example, those records could be manipulated,” he added. “We don’t believe they are, but we have to be able to hold up to the standards of a criminal court … [the records] don’t meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

Guglielmi continued, “He [Smollett] committed early on to getting those records and he followed through with that. He’s very much still considered a victim and the investigation continues.”

Chris Bastardi, a spokesperson for Smollett explained that the redacted records were “intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

“Chicago Police have not told us that they are rejecting any records, nor have they expressed concerns about the records to us,” he added.

Guglielmi told the outlet, at the time of publication, he could not confirm if detectives had yet told Smollett the current records they provided were insufficient.

It all comes on the heels of reports that police were seeking “people of interest” after the “On Our Own” star told authorities he was attacked by masked men near his home in Chicago last month.

“The victim goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men,” Guglielmi stated. “They were masked and wearing black clothing. They called him an Empire … and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.”

Smollett told police at the time of the attack he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore. Moore told police he heard the racist and homophobic slurs, so police need the phone records to corroborate the two accounts of what allegedly occurred."

Police have made no arrests and said they have found no surveillance video that shows the attack. They have released video of two people in the area at the time who they said were persons of interest.

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,” the statement said. “Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.”

But Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Monday that the phone records turned over by Smollett are in a heavily redacted document file and the records from the manager Smollett says he was talking to when the attack occurred were a screenshot of phone calls. He says the records aren’t sufficient for an investigation.

Smollett’s statement said he had good reasons for turning over limited information.

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” his statement said.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before and looped a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck. Smollett also told detectives that before they ran off, the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country, ” a reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan President Donald Trump uses.

Smollett and his family have insisted that he has been truthful about the attack and his story has not changed since it happened.

Police have collected video surveillance footage from cameras in the downtown area and have also extended their search to stores in the area in the hopes of gathering evidence on who might have purchased the rope."

The newsman started off Monday’s show by addressing his experiences with having an intersectional black and gay identity.

“As black gay men, we carry the racism part, and we carry the gay part,” he said on the Facebook Watch Series. “We’re already a class of people who have been discriminated against,” he said.

Lemon and the “Red Table Talk” trio, which includes Pinkett Smith’s daughter Willow Smith and her mother, Adrienne Banfield Norris, also discussed societal stereotypes of black men and black male masculinity, and the difficulty many people experience coming out.

Pinkett Smith asked the CNN anchor about his initial reaction to hearing reports that “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was attacked in Chicago last month, reportedly by two men who had yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him.

“My initial reaction was sadness,” Lemon said. “I wasn’t shocked. I didn’t like that it happened to him.” He added that he called Smollett shortly after.

Lemon then expressed his concern for the actor’s “well-being” while the police investigation is underway.

“On top of being ― one, he has to deal with discrimination as a black man, and then on top of that he has to be gay ― and he’s out,” he said. “And then fame. And fame is not natural. I don’t think people were meant to be famous.”

Last month, Lemon delivered an on-air plea to comedian Kevin Hart to become an ally to the LGBTQ community after Hart’s old homophobic tweets and jokes came to light.

“We need to speak up for the young black people, especially young black men, kids, in the LGBT community,” Lemon said at the time.

Lemon told the co-hosts that he came out as gay to his mother when he was 30, after he’d broken up with a boyfriend.

“And it came out on the phone and she was very quiet ― but very accepting,” he said as he held back tears. “She said, ‘You’re my son. I’m going to love you no matter what. I’m your mom. I’m always going to love you.’ That meant the world to me ...”
