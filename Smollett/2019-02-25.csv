Trans Person Burned Down Own Home Due To LGBT Issues Not Getting Enough Attention, Report Suggests",[],https://www.dailywire.com/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/uploads/2019/02/nikki_joly.jpg?itok=bjPzpgtD,"['trans', 'lgbt', 'nikki', 'rights', 'detroit', 'report', 'suggests', 'person', 'hoax', 'evidence', 'joly', 'received', 'crime', 'jackson', 'getting', 'hate', 'issues']","Michigan prosecutors charged 54-year-old Nikki Joly — a transgender person — for allegedly burning down their own home in 2017 in what investigators appear to believe was intended to be a fake hate crime.

The LGBT activist — whose five pets were killed in the fire — had allegedly received threats in the past and was instrumental in leading a battle for LGBT rights in Jackson, Michigan.

“Authorities later determined the fire was intentionally set, but the person they arrested came as a shock to both supporters and opponents of the gay rights movement,” The Detroit News reported on Monday. “It was the citizen of the year — Nikki Joly.”

While an official motive has not yet been established, The Detroit News noted that an investigative police report shed light on a possible motive:

Two people who worked with Joly at St. Johns United Church of Christ, where the Jackson Pride Center was located, said he had been frustrated the controversy over gay rights had died down with the passage of the nondiscrimination law, according to the report. The church officials, Barbara Shelton and Bobby James, when asked by police about a possible motive for the fire, said Joly was disappointed the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival, held five days before the blaze, hadn’t received more attention or protests.

Shelton later told a reporter she was “not sure” that she told police that.

“Shelton and James both described Nikki as very deceptive and stated that when it comes to Nikki there are ‘layers of manipulation,'” police detective Aaron Grove wrote in the report.

“It’s embarrassing,” said LGBT rights activist Travis Trombley. “How do you do it to the community you have put so much effort into helping?”

Elmer Hitt, Jackson’s director of police and fire services, said on Monday that members of the community perceived the blaze to be a hate crime, but after a year of investigating the crime, prosecutors “ended up issuing charges” for first-degree arson on Joly.

The Detroit Free Press reported that “in the Joly case, police suspicion was based on a timeline of events, phone records, physical evidence and witness statements.”

“Joly had the ‘means and opportunity to start the fire,’ according to a report published by MLive.com in October,” The Detroit Free Press added. “The MLive article said security camera video showed Joly filling a gas can before the fire, gasoline was on his clothing, a witness smelled gas on him, photographs seemed to be missing from the walls, and after the fire, Joly received $50,000 in donations.”

The alleged hate crime hoax comes after “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was charged last week for allegedly lying to police about a racist and homophobic attack on himself that happened on January 29.

Police allege that Smollett orchestrated the attack because he was angered over his $65,000 per episode compensation.

“Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave,” Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson said on Monday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

“There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened,” Johnson continued. “It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something, it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this.”"

If he faked an assault, he has provided skeptical police officers and unsympathetic right-wingers another excuse not to take such claims seriously.

Smollett — who turned himself in after he was accused of filing a false police report — deserves, like all criminal suspects, the presumption of innocence. His family and his attorneys continue to insist that the actor, who is openly gay, did nothing wrong.

But his story began to fall apart pretty quickly after he made the claim late last month about a vicious attack on a Chicago street as he walked alone late at night. Smollett told police that two masked men punched him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs. He also claimed one yelled, ""This is MAGA country!"" — invoking President Donald Trump's signature phrase, ""Make America Great Again."" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that Smollett paid two men to help him stage the attack.

As feminist writer Roxane Gay tweeted: ""Why would he make it harder for people who actually suffer from hate crimes? It makes no sense. The lie is so damaging.""

On cue, Trump quickly jumped in on Twitter, feigning outrage on behalf of all of his supposedly defamed supporters. ""@JussieSmollett — what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA,"" Trump tweeted.

Conservative commentators, some of whom were already openly skeptical of Smollett's claims, also raced to denounce the actor and his defenders. This case will likely get more attention on right-wing radio talk shows than all the actual cases of hate crimes taken together.

And there are plenty of real hate crimes to keep police busy. Just last week, federal authorities arrested an active-duty U.S. Coast Guard officer, Lt. Christopher Paul Hasson, who called for ""focused violence"" to ""establish a white homeland."" Investigators uncovered a cache of weapons and ammunition at his home, as well as a hit list that read like a who's who of journalists and Democratic politicians. If notes confiscated from his computer are any guide, Hasson was becoming increasingly alarmed at the prospect that Trump might be impeached and was readying a strike. His Excel spreadsheet, according to published reports, included this chilling tidbit: ""best place in dc to see congress people.""

As alarming as this development is, it's no surprise. Trump has catered to bigots since he started his presidential campaign, and they have felt empowered since his election. He began his political career as the nation's most famous birther, notoriously insisting that President Barack Obama was a usurper who wasn't born in this country. He easily segued into a campaign that insulted Mexicans, denounced Muslims and placated white supremacists. His rallying cry, ""Make America Great Again,"" is clearly a call for a return to a time when black and brown Americans had little political or economic power and no cultural clout.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such things, the number of hate groups operating in the United States is now at an all-time high; it has identified 1,020 such groups. The Trump presidency has seen, among other assaults, the calamity at Charlottesville, where Heather Heyer was fatally struck by a car driven by a white terrorist looking to mow down peaceful protesters, and the atrocity last year at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, which left 11 worshippers dead.

Smollett may have seen an opportunity in linking his allegedly fake claim to an actual perpetrator: a president who has continually engaged in hateful and divisive rhetoric that stirs up the lunatic element among his supporters. If Smollett lied, he has only assisted the hater in chief."

On Friday evening, the San Diego Union-Tribune announced that it was removing a work by Steve Breen, the paper's longtime editorial cartoonist, from its website.

Jeff Light, the paper's publisher and editor in chief, also apologized for the cartoon, which in his words ""drew an ironic parallel between two august figures - James Baldwin and Toni Morrison - and Jussie Smollett,"" the ""Empire"" actor accused of staging a hate crime last month and lying to Chicago police about it.

The cartoon, published Friday, depicted successive portraits of Baldwin, Morrison and Smollett beneath the caption, ""Famous African-American Storytellers.""

""I consider the cartoon offensive and not in line with our values as a company,"" Light wrote. Matthew T. Hall, the paper's editorial and opinion director, also apologized for the cartoon.

The San Diego newspaper was formerly owned by Tribune Publishing, then-named Tronc, which owns the Chicago Tribune. It was sold, along with the Los Angeles Times, to Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong in June.

""I ultimately agree with the decision to pull the cartoon because enough thoughtful people have told me they find it offensive,"" Breen, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, told The Washington Post. ""I'm frustrated with myself because I feel with a few tweaks, the cartoon could have been salvaged, but I'm not exactly sure what those would be.

""Maybe with the wording. Maybe with James Baldwin and Toni Morrison saying something to Jussie Smollett. I'm not sure - maybe nothing could have made it inoffensive."" Breen said he was attempting to satirize Smollett through the incongruity of the cartoon's roster.

""The problem is, I was trying to contrast Jussie Smollett with James Baldwin and Toni Morrison, and people read it as a comparison,"" says Breen, who notes that going forward, he will more carefully vet his cartoons involving race.

On the Andrews McMeel Syndication website that carries Breen, some commenters called the cartoon's grouping of names a ""disrespectful"" and an ""intellectually dishonest comparison"" that appeared to ""trivialize the greatness of two people.""

One reader said: ""Your cartoon clearly positioned Baldwin and Morrison as if they were part of a police line-up with Smollett. At first - and at even second glance, with little knowledge of these literary geniuses or of Smollett's story, they all look guilty of 'storytelling.' "" Another reader, though, wrote: ""I saw the cartoon as contrast and not comparison right away. Although I can see how it could be taken offensively I didn't get that vibe from Steve Breen's work. An explanation not an apology would have sufficed.""

Morrison has received the Pulitzer Prize, the Nobel Prize for literature, the Coretta Scott King Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her writing, including the ""Beloved"" trilogy, ""Song of Solomon"" and ""The Bluest Eye.""

Baldwin's many honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship and France's La Legion D'Honneur. The late author-activist's fifth novel, ""If Beale Street Could Talk,"" was adapted into Barry Jenkins's 2018 film that received an Academy Award on Sunday and three Spirit Awards on Saturday.

Jussie Smollett has starred in hip-hop drama Empire since 2015, playing Jamal Lyon. His character cohabits with his Latino boyfriend but is not publicly out because of his father’s prejudice against gay people. Jussie, who came out as gay in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on her show in 2015, has been praised for this performance in the role. Although Empire is his biggest part to date, the TV star previously racked up a number of roles in big-name TV shows.

How did Jussie Smollett rise to fame? How much does he earn at Empire? Jussie Smollet was born in Santa Rose, California, the third of six children. The 36-year-old found fame young, starring in the Emilio Estevez film, The Mighty Ducks, in 1992. He followed this up with a turn in Rob Reiner’s North in 1994 before starring with his real-life brothers and sisters in TV series On Our Own.

The ABC sitcom, which ran for one season between September 1994 and April 1995, focused on the siblings’ fight to stay together after losing their parents. After a break from acting, Jussie returned to TV screens in 2012 with a guest role on The Mindy Project in 2012. Following some other minor parts, he secured the part of Jamal Lyon in 2014. Jussie's salary on Empire is the subject of debate, with a ""well-placed source"" telling the Huffington Post it is $65,000.

The Hollywood Reporter has said it is $125,000. Jussie, who is also a songwriter, wrote original tracks featuring in the official season 1 soundtrack for Empire. He later released music under his own name and his first album, Sum of My Music, debuted in March 2018. Having already started on the show, Jussie did not come out as gay until speaking with Ellen DeGeneres in March 2015.

Kelly is broker than a joke and couldn’t his post bail, the music superstar posted bond Monday and is expected to be released within the hour, CBS News reports.

The singer’s attorney had given a heads up earlier in the day that his client could be released Monday night. After a weekend behind bars in the Windy City, Kelly appeared in court Monday morning where attorney Steve Greenberg entered not guilty pleas for him to multiple sexual assault charges.

The singer is expected to pay 10 percent of the total $1 million bail Monday evening in order to go free. Meanwhile, hardcore female fans had been hitting up the Chicago court clerk’s office and inquiring about how they could post his $100,000 bond, Complex reports.

—Chicago police chief claims brothers confirmed Jussie Smollett check was payment for the attack—

According to published reports, the holdup with Kelly’s release was never over him being unable to cough up the money himself. The issue was with the nearly $170,000 in child support he reportedly owes. It’s unclear what amount had to be satisfied with the court before he could post bond.

Greenberg noted that the back child-support debt is unrelated to the criminal case.

“There was a back child-support order. That’s a civil order. He doesn’t have to post that to get out of jail,” Greenberg said at a press conference.

The “Trapped in the Closet” singer turned himself into Chicago police Friday night after being hit with a 10-count indictment on charges that he sexually abused four women, including three who were underage.

“At this point in time, I have no reason to believe that there is any tape of Mr. Kelly acting inappropriately in relation to these cases, or that he’s done anything else wrong,” Greenberg said.

Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for two of the alleged victims, dropped yet another bombshell Monday afternoon when he announced the existence of even more sex tapes featuring the music icon and underage girls.

“I can confirm that we will be providing a second video showing R. Kelly engaged in sexual assault of a minor to prosecutors this morning. This tape was recently uncovered in connection with our ongoing nationwide investigation on behalf of victims. Justice must be done,” Avenatti wrote on Twitter."

Superintendent Eddie Johnson told Robin Roberts on Good Morning America that Smollett had the presumption of innocence, but explained that the police had much more evidence than the check that has been undermined in the media.

""Did the brothers specifically say that was for the attack?"" Roberts asked.

""They said that he paid them thirty-five hundred with a check,"" Johnson responded.

""But did they say what it was for?"" she pressed.

""Yeah, to uh, carry out this incident,"" he responded.

'Physical evidence, video evidence, and testimony'

Johnson added at the end of the interview that despite all the evidence they had presented already in order to prove Smollett had orchestrated the attack, they had much more in store that had not been revealed yet.

""You know I was very acutely aware of the situation in terms of the Chicago police department declaring he was a suspect,"" said Johnson.



""But I can tell you this, Robin,"" he continued, ""there's a lot more evidence that hasn't been presented yet that does not support the version that he gave.""

""There's more because you presented quite a bit,"" responded Roberts, ""I mean legal experts said that's the most that they've seen being presented up front like that.""

And as you already know, King Regina is the master when it comes to acceptance speeches.

DARK ENERGY Is making the universe expand faster than expected according to the New York Times. “Long, long ago, when the universe was only about 100,000 years old — a buzzing, expanding mass of particles and radiation — a strange new energy field switched on. That energy suffused space with a kind of cosmic antigravity, delivering a not-so-gentle boost to the expansion of the universe. Then, after another 100,000 years or so, the new field simply winked off, leaving no trace other than a speeded-up universe. So goes the strange-sounding story being promulgated by a handful of astronomers from Johns Hopkins University. In a bold and speculative leap into the past, the team has posited the existence of this field to explain an astronomical puzzle: the universe seems to be expanding faster than it should be.

The cosmos is expanding only about 9 percent more quickly than theory prescribes. But this slight-sounding discrepancy has intrigued astronomers, who think it might be revealing something new about the universe.

QUOTE OF THE DAY From Jason Adams over at My New Plaid Pants. “For the first time, everything was painful and problematic from start to finish, from funding to post-production, and beyond… It would be inelegant to name precisely the people who were problematic, and I am finally proud of the end result, but we had to make very difficult choices. I lived all the disappointments that I could live, humanly and artistically. By switching to a large budget, a fragmented shooting, in English and on two continents, I had to face my own ignorance, inexperience, incompetence. Everything was new to me, I had the impression go out of my kitchen, that is to say, leaving my artisanal practice of the cinema.” That’s Xavier Dolan talking to Télérama (via The Playlist) about the making of The Death and Life of John F. Donovan, starring Kit Harington et cetera — that film is hitting theaters internationally in March but we don’t have a US date yet; we posted the trailer and some piping hot pics of Kit a couple of weeks ago right here.

According to news publications, the organising committee has been quoted as saying they plan to stage a mass participation event on the same day as the elite race, “on the same course and in the same conditions as the Olympic athletes,” according to Runners World.

“They have also hinted they are looking at other events on the Olympic schedule in which they can include mass participation. The mass race would take place on the same day as the elite competition, but would take place at a different time, according to committee president Tony Estanguet. In this respect, it would be similar to other Major Marathons, in which the elite set off before the masses. However, Estanguet added, “this is the Olympic marathon. And that’s what’s really, truly different.”

Gross, MBTA Police Chief Ken Green and Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard are now three of the top cops in Greater Boston.

Speaking with NBC10 Boston, the trio addressed the racial progress that has been made as well as areas that need to be improved.

In an area known for champions, innovation and prestigious schools, there remains an undercurrent of racism in the Greater Boston area. And at times, perception is reality for those affected.

Boston Police Commissioner William Gross recounts a time when, as a young patrolman, he chased down a suspect alongside a white officer.

""Being in a foot pursuit with someone who's next to you that's Caucasian, and have them say 'Stop, n-word,' you're like, 'What?' 'Oh, not you, you're a good guy,'"" said Gross.

NBC10 Boston reporter Jonathan Choe asks Boston Police Commissioner William Gross, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard and MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green about Boston's reputation regarding racism.

MBTA Police Chief Ken Green also faced discrimination early in his career.

""There were times where people didn't really want to deal with me,"" he recalled. ""They wanted to deal with the white officer I was with.""

""I'm treated fantastic, with this uniform on, everywhere I go. I take this uniform off, it's not always the case,"" Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard added.

NBC10 Boston reporter Jonathan Choe asks Boston Police Commissioner William Gross, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard and MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green about the perception of black men in America today.

They say it comes with the territory and the color of their skin. But they're now turning the page and writing a new chapter in this narrative.

""I think we're moving in the right direction,"" said Gross.

For the first time ever, three black men are leading the largest local law enforcement agencies in Greater Boston. They know it is a tremendous privilege and responsibility.

NBC10 Boston reporter Jonathan Choe asks Boston Police Commissioner William Gross, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard and MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green about the kind of racism they've faced as law enforcement officers and as leaders.

""I know I'm being looked at,"" Gross said. ""I'm not under a microscope. I'm under an electron microscope magnified 10,000 times.""

Along with fighting crime and guiding men and women from diverse backgrounds, they're still trying to process and deal with the issues of our time lingering over their agencies.

""You don't like what's going on, we don't like what's going on,"" said Green.

NBC10 Boston reporter Jonathan Choe asks Boston Police Commissioner William Gross, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard and MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green about how they encourage one another.

Gross says unarmed black men being shot and killed by white officers, fueling anti-police sentiment, is one of the reasons for the recent decline in candidates applying to join the force.

""At one time, if you wanted to take the Boston police exam, you would have to compete from anywhere from 8,000 to 20,000 candidates. Recent exams, we are lucky to get 2,000 people,"" the commissioner said.

The men were also asked about the ongoing effects of negative black stereotypes — the police leaders gave some examples.

Forensic experts attempted to separate and count charred heaps of corpses in central Mexico on Saturday after a massive fireball erupted at an illegal pipeline tap, killing at least 73 people and injuring at least 74. Forensic experts combed the site for remains, many of which were reduced to ashes. At least 54 bodies have yet to be identified. The fireball was caused by a leak in an illegal pipeline tap in the small town of Tlahuelilpan, about 62 miles (100 kilometers) north of Mexico City, according to state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex.

""You don't care about anything, except sex, drugs, sports, fashion, music,"" said Gross.

""You only got the sergeant's position because they needed a black sergeant, not because you topped the list,"" said Green.

Then there's the disproportionate number of black men in America's prisons.

""My mother has two sons. One of us is in jail for life, the other one is chief of police, a police commissioner,"" said Bard, adding that he, Gross and Green beat the odds. ""In many ways, we are all statistical anomalies, to rise to the positions that we are in.""

NBC10 Boston reporter Jonathan Choe asks Boston Police Commissioner William Gross, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard and MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green about what the media gets wrong when it comes to covering communities of color.

The chief and commissioners outlined some hopes for Black History Month and looked back at the accomplishments of African Americans.

""Just educate people again about who we are, and lead by example,"" said Gross.

""I'm keenly aware that I didn't get here by myself and others paved the way for me to do this,"" Bard said.

But now, instead of a victim, the 54-year-old is accused of being the perpetrator.

The Michigan case is gaining national attention alongside the situation involving Jussie Smollett, another alleged hate crime victim who became the accused. Authorities concluded the attack on Smollett was a hoax.

“Real hate crimes are on the rise,” Graham Cassano, associate professor of sociology at Michigan's Oakland University, said Monday. “But, as these crimes increase and become publicized, it’s not surprising to me that people would take the opportunity to use this to their advantage and fabricate hate crimes.”

Authorities accuse Joly of setting fire to his own home and killing his pets, two dogs and three cats. He has been charged with first-degree arson, and a hearing has been set for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court.

""We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,"" Elmer Hitt, Jackson’s director of police and fire services, said Monday. ""We investigated it over, what probably was a year’s time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.”

Two cases with unexpected twists

Initially, some in the community perceived the blaze to be a hate crime, Hitt said. Investigators considered that, too, but ruled out the possibility as evidence that pointed to Joly came to light.

Declining to offer a motive for the house fire, Hitt acknowledged that some in Jackson were probably rattled — perhaps in a similar way to the Smollett case — by the police investigation's unexpected outcome and charge. Joly was named 2018's Citizen of the Year by the Jackson's newspaper, the Citizen Patriot.

In the higher-profile hate crime case that turned on its head last week, Smollett, a 36-year-old actor on the drama TV series ""Empire,"" alleged to Chicago police he had been a victim. Smollett was arrested on charges that he set up the assault.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said masked men yelled racial slurs, attacked him, put a rope around his neck and made references to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

But, Chicago police said, their investigation found evidence that Smollett staged the crime, possibly to portray himself as a victim and boost his salary as an actor, and lied to police.

Tearing up at the thought of his dogs

Joly, a transgender man, was touted as Jackon's 2018 citizen of the year by the local newspaper and described as an activist who had endured slights and still re-energized a movement.

He tried to ""pass an ordinance in Jackson protecting people against discrimination because they are gay, because they are transgender, because they aren't as some say they should be,"" according to the newspaper.

The long profile described the Detroit native as someone who had been on his own since his adoptive parents ousted him at 15, had been sexually assaulted, and subjected to ""insulting gender questions"" and ""refused service in bars or restaurants.""

Joly, the article said, was ""born female,"" but ""prefers a masculine pronoun,"" and has long ""been activist-minded even if it was not always openly.""

It also mentioned the fire on Aug. 10, 2017, in which his home was burned down.

In the profile, Joly said that he was ""really in shock for quite a while."" He teared at the thought of his dogs, who perished in the blaze, the article said, and organized a weapons training course at a gun range to fight fear.

A few months later, Joly was charged with setting the fire.

Terrible for those 'facing real hate crimes'

In the Joly case, police suspicion was based on a timeline of events, phone records, physical evidence and witness statements. Joly had the ""means and opportunity to start the fire,"" according to a report published by Mlive.com in October.

Security camera video showed Joly filling a gas can before the fire, the Mive article said. Gasoline was on his clothing, per the report, and a witness smelled gas on him. Photographs seemed to be missing from the walls, and Joly received $50,000 in donations after the fire.

Joly's attorney, Andrew Abood, challenged the police conclusion.

""What they have is a coincidence and a coincidence is not proof beyond reasonable doubt,"" Abood said, per Mlive. ""They are trying to convict on circumstantial evidence and theory when they have no direct evidence in the case.""

Still, Cassano said, when presumed victims of hate crimes are actually the perpetrators, ""it's terrible for social movements in general"" and terrible, specifically, for people ""facing real hate crimes.""

In 2018 alone, the civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Campaign, tracked 26 deaths of transgender people in the U.S. as a result of fatal violence. So far this year, the group identified one death.

The most recent stats from the FBI showed 7,106 hate crimes in 2017, up 17 percent from the year before. Of those crimes, nearly 60 percent of the victims were targeted because of race and ethnicity and nearly 16 percent because of sexual orientation.

""When someone comes along and fabricates a hate crime, it calls into question people who have really experience these things,"" Cassano said. ""It's absolutely awful. It really, to my mind, is incomprehensible.""

Wilfred Reilly, an associate professor of political science at Kentucky State University in Frankfort who has studied fake hate crimes, wrote that the fact that Smollett’s case is being alleged a hoax ""shouldn’t surprise anyone.""

Reiley didn't mention the Joly case but made the case in an opinion piece for USA Today and a book ""Hate Crime Hoax: How the Left is Selling a Fake Race War,"" that ""a great many hate crime stories turn out to be hoaxes.""

The professor said he found more than 400 confirmed hate hoaxes, and he concluded that ""what hate hoaxers actually do is worsen generally good race relations, and distract attention from real problems.""

Gross, MBTA Police Chief Ken Green and Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard are now three of the top cops in Greater Boston.

Speaking with NBC10 Boston, the trio addressed the racial progress that has been made as well as areas that need to be improved.

In an area known for champions, innovation and prestigious schools, there remains an undercurrent of racism in the Greater Boston area. And at times, perception is reality for those affected.

Boston Police Commissioner William Gross recounts a time when, as a young patrolman, he chased down a suspect alongside a white officer.

""Being in a foot pursuit with someone who's next to you that's Caucasian, and have them say 'Stop, n-word,' you're like, 'What?' 'Oh, not you, you're a good guy,'"" said Gross.

NBC10 Boston reporter Jonathan Choe asks Boston Police Commissioner William Gross, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard and MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green about Boston's reputation regarding racism.

MBTA Police Chief Ken Green also faced discrimination early in his career.

""There were times where people didn't really want to deal with me,"" he recalled. ""They wanted to deal with the white officer I was with.""

""I'm treated fantastic, with this uniform on, everywhere I go. I take this uniform off, it's not always the case,"" Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard added.

NBC10 Boston reporter Jonathan Choe asks Boston Police Commissioner William Gross, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard and MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green about the perception of black men in America today.

They say it comes with the territory and the color of their skin. But they're now turning the page and writing a new chapter in this narrative.

""I think we're moving in the right direction,"" said Gross.

For the first time ever, three black men are leading the largest local law enforcement agencies in Greater Boston. They know it is a tremendous privilege and responsibility.

NBC10 Boston reporter Jonathan Choe asks Boston Police Commissioner William Gross, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard and MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green about the kind of racism they've faced as law enforcement officers and as leaders.

""I know I'm being looked at,"" Gross said. ""I'm not under a microscope. I'm under an electron microscope magnified 10,000 times.""

Along with fighting crime and guiding men and women from diverse backgrounds, they're still trying to process and deal with the issues of our time lingering over their agencies.

""You don't like what's going on, we don't like what's going on,"" said Green.

NBC10 Boston reporter Jonathan Choe asks Boston Police Commissioner William Gross, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard and MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green about how they encourage one another.

Gross says unarmed black men being shot and killed by white officers, fueling anti-police sentiment, is one of the reasons for the recent decline in candidates applying to join the force.

""At one time, if you wanted to take the Boston police exam, you would have to compete from anywhere from 8,000 to 20,000 candidates. Recent exams, we are lucky to get 2,000 people,"" the commissioner said.

The men were also asked about the ongoing effects of negative black stereotypes — the police leaders gave some examples.

Forensic experts attempted to separate and count charred heaps of corpses in central Mexico on Saturday after a massive fireball erupted at an illegal pipeline tap, killing at least 73 people and injuring at least 74. Forensic experts combed the site for remains, many of which were reduced to ashes. At least 54 bodies have yet to be identified. The fireball was caused by a leak in an illegal pipeline tap in the small town of Tlahuelilpan, about 62 miles (100 kilometers) north of Mexico City, according to state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex.

""You don't care about anything, except sex, drugs, sports, fashion, music,"" said Gross.

""You only got the sergeant's position because they needed a black sergeant, not because you topped the list,"" said Green.

Then there's the disproportionate number of black men in America's prisons.

""My mother has two sons. One of us is in jail for life, the other one is chief of police, a police commissioner,"" said Bard, adding that he, Gross and Green beat the odds. ""In many ways, we are all statistical anomalies, to rise to the positions that we are in.""

NBC10 Boston reporter Jonathan Choe asks Boston Police Commissioner William Gross, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville Bard and MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green about what the media gets wrong when it comes to covering communities of color.

The chief and commissioners outlined some hopes for Black History Month and looked back at the accomplishments of African Americans.

""Just educate people again about who we are, and lead by example,"" said Gross.

""I'm keenly aware that I didn't get here by myself and others paved the way for me to do this,"" Bard said.

But the law enforcement leaders added that there is still plenty of work to be done.

""You don't want to let these people down,"" Green said. ""And we're not going to let them down."""

He’s now been accused of staging a racist, anti-gay attack on himself in Chicago in January in a celebrity scandal that has captured attention online and in the media.

This was all done in an alleged attempt to keep himself from being written off of the Fox show “Empire,” while also securing more money as $125K per episode just wasn’t enough for him any longer. The fact that his music wasn’t selling well did nothing to make him appreciate the Fox gig. He needed more and then after claiming that it was just ‘fake news‘ that he faked everything, he quickly claimed to have a drug addiction. All of this is just disgusting as he has made it even harder for those people going through racist and homophobic attacks on a regular basis to be able to come forward. Then trying to play the drug card so he won’t have to go to jail just shows the level this man is at.

Smollett is not the first celebrity to be accused of lying to the public. But he faces a felony charge for allegedly filing a false police report.

Below is a sampling of celebrities and athletes caught red handed or I guess I should say red tongued.

Feb. 10, 2015, Brian Williams:

NBC suspended the “Nightly News” anchor and managing editor for six months without pay amid questions about his memories and experiences while covering the Iraq War. Lester Holt was eventually named Williams’ replacement on “Nightly News.”

Sept. 16, 2015, Steve Rannazzisi:

The comedian and actor admitted to the New York Times that he lied about working in the World Trade Center when terrorists attacked on Sept. 11. Rannazzisi said telling the story was “a mistake that I deeply regret and for which apologies may still not be enough.”

Feb. 19, 2015, Bill O’Reilly:

O’Reilly was accused of claiming he had reported in a combat zone for CBS News during the 1982 Falklands War when he was more than 1,000 miles from the front. An article questioning the validity of his story was first published by Mother Jones. O’Reilly vehemently denied the report, saying to any reporters working on a story about him, “I am coming after you with everything I have.” He was fired from Fox News in 2017 amid harassment allegations.

Jan. 18, 2013, Lance Armstrong:

The disgraced seven-time Tour de France winner admitted in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that he used steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs during those championship rides. He later settled a $100 million lawsuit with the federal government.

Jan. 16, 2013, Manti Te’o:

Te’o and Notre Dame, where the linebacker played at the time, issued a statement saying Te’o had been the victim of a hoax in which someone using the fictitious name Lennay Kekua and others conspired “to lead him to believe she had tragically died of leukemia” after Deadspin published a story detailing the fake relationship. Te’o played for the New Orleans Saints last season.

Jan. 27, 2006, James Frey:

The author of the 2003 memoir “A Million Little Pieces” admitted to Oprah Winfrey that he partially fabricated or embellished parts of the book. Winfrey, who had included the memoir in her book club, chastised him for the lies. In 2018, it was announced that the book will be brought to the big screen.

March 17, 2005, Lil’ Kim:

The Grammy-winning rapper was convicted of lying to a federal grand jury to protect friends involved in a 2001 shootout outside a Manhattan radio station. She was sentenced to one year and one day in prison and fined $50,000.

March 5, 2004, Martha Stewart:

Stewart was convicted of lying to prosecutors about a stock sale and sentenced to five months in federal prison. Since her release, Stewart has hosted numerous talk shows and cooking programs.

Aug. 17, 1998, President Bill Clinton:

Months after famously declaring he “did not have sexual relations with that woman,” President Clinton gave a nationally televised statement to admit to having a relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky that was “not appropriate.” In December 1998, the Republican-led House voted to impeach Clinton but he was eventually acquitted in the Senate and remained in office.

March 16, 1994, Tonya Harding:

A former Olympic figure skater, Harding pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution in the attack on rival skater Nancy Kerrigan. As part of the plea deal, Harding resigned from the U.S. Figure Skating Association, ending her amateur career. She was also fined $100,000 and given three years’ supervised probation. Her story was turned into a dark comedy starring Margot Robbi and Allison Janney.

Nov. 19, 1990, Milli Vanilli:

The duo thought to be vocalizing hit songs like “Girl You Know It’s True” and “Blame It on the Rain” had their Grammy taken away by the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences after its producer confirmed rumors that Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan were only front men on the album that won them Best New Artist. The two later put out an album called “Rob & Fab” using their own voices. Pilatus died in 1998.

Aug. 24, 1989, Pete Rose:

Major League Baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti banned Rose from baseball for life. At the time, Rose was managing the Cincinnati Reds. Giamatti said he had evidence that Rose had bet on baseball games, specifically ones involving the Reds. Multiple reinstatement efforts to allow Rose back into MLB’s good graces have failed. Giamatti died eight days after Rose’s banishment.

Jan. 28, 1972, Clifford Irving:

Said to be writing a supposed autobiography about the notoriously reclusive Howard Hughes, Irving admitted to forging the book. The confession came a few weeks after Hughes gave a telephone conference with reporters to say he had never met Irving. Hughes’ lawyer sued Irving and his publisher. Irving was eventually found guilty of fraud and sentenced to six months in prison. He died in 2017."

The potential series is said to be a period piece that would follow Mr. Wing, the Chinese grandfather played in the films by Keye Luke, as a young man as he goes on adventures with the friendly Mogwai Gizmo. The series will be produced by Warner Bros. Television and Amblin Television. Both Warner Bros. and Amblin produced the films on which the show will be based.

Warner Bros. and Amblin declined to comment.

Tze Chun is attached to write and executive produce. He is known for writing and directing films like 2013's ""Cold Comes the Night"" starring Bryan Cranston and 2009's ""Children of Invention. Chun's TV credits include shows like ""Gotham"" and ""Once Upon a Time."" He is also the co-founder of comic book publisher TKO Studios.

Chun is repped by WME and Morris Yorn.

The first ""Gremlins"" film was released in 1984. Directed by Joe Danteand written by Chris Columbus, the film was a major box office success. It went on to gross over $153 million worldwide on a reported budget of $11 million. A sequel, ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch,"" was released in 1990 with Dante returning to direct.

News of the development comes as WarnerMedia prepares to enter the streaming space with its yet-to-be-named streaming platform. Kevin Reilly, the chief creative officer Turner and direct-to-consumer, said at the recent TCA winter press tour that a beta version of the service will not feature original content, with originals expected to begin launching in 2020. He said that WarnerMedia will be looking to mine in-house properties-like ""Gremlins""-to generate new content for the service but that not all originals would be based on WarnerMedia IP.

Reilly also hinted that major Warner properties like ""Friends"" would eventually be pulled from other streaming services like Netflix in favor of having them exclusively on Warner OTT. ""You can expect that the crown jewels of Warner will ultimately end up on the new service,"" he said, adding that ""sharing destination assets like that… (is) not a good model.""

Among Smollett’s attorneys is Mark Geragos, a Los Angeles-based lawyer whose clients have included Michael Jackson and Colin Kaepernick.

His next court appearance is scheduled for March 14.

At his bond court appearance last Thursday, Smollett’s bail was set at $100,000 and he was also ordered to surrender his passport. He was released from the Cook County Jail shortly after his hearing.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported that he was victim of a racist, homophobic attack in Streeterville in the early hours of Jan. 29.

He told investigators that he was attacked by two masked men who beat him, put a noose around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him while one of them yelled “This is MAGA country” — a reference to President Donald Trump’s catchphrase “Make America Great Again.”

Weeks after the report, Smollett was charged with disorderly conduct. Police have said Smollett orchestrated the attack on his own because he was dissatisfied with his salary on “Empire.”"

The public comments were made on Twitter from an account used by the brothers, and Jussie's defense may include the statements to show Ola and Abel Osundairo allegedly have issues with homosexuality.

In 2013, the Nigerian man was scolding someone for being a fan of R&B artist, Frank Ocean. ""Why you following Frank Ocean ... you know that ni**a gay right,"" Ola tweeted at the man. Another message stated, ""YOU'RE GAY THATS WHO YOU ARE,"" although it's unclear who Usondairo was speaking about.



twitter

Possibly reinforcing his own sexuality, Osundairo once proclaimed, ""I don't follow any man. I follow woman.""

Sources point out that the brothers' home country of Nigeria is known for not recognizing LGBTQ rights, or providing any legal protection from discrimination.

The behavior seemingly goes against the brothers initial public statements, where they claimed, ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

The brothers will also have trouble justifying the comments if brought up during the case, and would have a hard time explaining why the comments were made.



TheBlast.com

Both of the Usondairo brothers have said the ""Empire"" star paid them $3,500 to help stage the attack, but Smollett is adamant the money paid was for a training session. The Blast obtained a copy of the alleged check, and it clearly says the payment is for a ""workout program.""

Sources close to the case tell us the testimony from the brothers went ""sideways"" while speaking in front of the grand jury, so the proceedings were halted and a criminal charge was filed instead.

Longtime Lawrence police officer Carlos Vieira, 49, was arrested in Haverhill without incident. He is charged with two counts of aggravated rape of a child and two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14.

""This is an ongoing investigation, but the allegations against Officer Vieira are extremely troubling, and we take them very seriously,” Lawrence Police Chief Roy Vasque said in a statement.

Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera echoed the chief's sentiment, saying in a statement that he is ""angry, sick, dismayed, and saddened by the accusations and charges against"" Vieira.

""We have worked very hard to improve and raise the professionalism of the Lawrence Police Department. We fired and expelled many officers who could not work between the code of conduct and the high level of professionalism in which my office, the police chief and the men and women and the leadership of the police unions worked,"" Mayor Rivera said.

Vieira's arrest follows an investigation by the Essex DA’s Office that began in January.

Authorities say the victim’s mother contacted them to report that her son, who was 13 at the time, had allegedly met Vieira using a social media app and engaged in sexual activity with him in the summer of 2018.

There was disbelief throughout Lawrence with the news of Vieira’s arrest.

“I'm just disgusted about it, I just have no comment after that,” a neighbor said.

Many of Vieira’s neighbors say they are surprised to hear about his arrest.

“From what I’ve seen, he looks like a good guy,” another man said. “For a guy, for him to be accused of such allegations, I don't think its real.”

Chief Vasque says Officer Vieira, who has been a member of the Lawrence Police Department since November of 1999, was placed on administrative leave immediately after the department was notified of his arrest by Massachusetts State Police.

Mayor Rivera says if the allegations are determined to be true, city officials will act quickly to remove him from his job.

""This is unforgivable,"" Rivera said.

Vieira is expected to be arraigned Tuesday in Lawrence District Court. It's unclear if he has an attorney."

He's proven time and time again that he's one of the best rappers and cultural commentators currently working. Staples' interviews tend to be a little more wide-ranging than most, with journalists giving the rapper the space to expound on anything that's currently happening.

That was the case in a new interview with GQ, where a supposed on-tour interview was guided into discussions about everything from Jussie Smollett to presidential fashion to the entire gossip industry. As always, Staples was candid and opinionated on every subject the interviewer tossed his way.

If you are wondering, Staples doesn't understand why Jussie Smollett is facing time for fraud when the Chicago Police aren't regularly held to the same standard.

""Ah, man, free the Juice Man. He's just running a little scam,"" he said. ""Hopefully he don't get time because police are smoking people, falsifying police reports, and they get to go home, so let my boy go home.""

Staples also felt that Smollett's decision to pull a scam was an indictment against the entertainment industry more than Smollett's character.

""Shit, the fact he feels like he has to do that says more about this world and less about him,"" he said. ""Because nobody wants to do that.""

While Staples has always proven to be an astute fashion critic, he didn't really want to discuss former president Barack Obama's bomber jacket.

""It just had a number on it. People are easily pleased nowadays. What am I supposed to say? He had on a black bomber jacket and they had the number 44 on the sleeve. What the fuck do that mean?"" he said, before being asked to comment on Trump's fashion sense. ""Why? Why do we care about either one of them? Why do I care that he got a number on the side of his bomber jacket from Uniqlo? And why do I care if Trump tapes his ties together?""

Vince saved his most cutting critique for gossip websites and the people who enjoy indulging in the dramatic bits of famous people's relationships. He also accused the people who peddle whisperings about relationships as cowardly, afraid to go after targets who might pull up on them.

""Shit, that's not my business,"" he said of Khloe Kardashian's recent relationship drama. ""And I think everybody who is obsessed with that on the internet is a loser. I really think that they're lame as fuck. I think everyone involved is a fucking loser. I think the journalists are fucking losers.

Longtime Lawrence police officer Carlos Vieira, 49, was arrested in Haverhill without incident. He is charged with two counts of aggravated rape of a child and two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14.

""This is an ongoing investigation, but the allegations against Officer Vieira are extremely troubling, and we take them very seriously,” Lawrence Police Chief Roy Vasque said in a statement.

Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera echoed the chief's sentiment, saying in a statement that he is ""angry, sick, dismayed, and saddened by the accusations and charges against"" Vieira.

""We have worked very hard to improve and raise the professionalism of the Lawrence Police Department. We fired and expelled many officers who could not work between the code of conduct and the high level of professionalism in which my office, the police chief and the men and women and the leadership of the police unions worked,"" Mayor Rivera said.

Vieira's arrest follows an investigation by the Essex DA’s Office that began in January.

Authorities say the victim’s mother contacted them to report that her son, who was 13 at the time, had allegedly met Vieira using a social media app and engaged in sexual activity with him in the summer of 2018.

There was disbelief throughout Lawrence with the news of Vieira’s arrest.

“I'm just disgusted about it, I just have no comment after that,” a neighbor said.

Many of Vieira’s neighbors say they are surprised to hear about his arrest.

“From what I’ve seen, he looks like a good guy,” another man said. “For a guy, for him to be accused of such allegations, I don't think its real.”

Chief Vasque says Officer Vieira, who has been a member of the Lawrence Police Department since November of 1999, was placed on administrative leave immediately after the department was notified of his arrest by Massachusetts State Police.

Mayor Rivera says if the allegations are determined to be true, city officials will act quickly to remove him from his job.

""This is unforgivable,"" Rivera said.

Vieira is expected to be arraigned Tuesday in Lawrence District Court. It's unclear if he has an attorney."

Gutfeld led off with a simple declaration, observing: “What a bad week for the activist press. Smollett, Sandmann, Lara Logan — the three horsemen of the media apocalypse.”

He then quipped that “[t]hey got every reporter pulling out their hair” “except for” CNN’s Reliable Sources host, default media defense attorney, and bald-headed Brian Stelter because “I think he's already moved on to his back.”

Sandmann was the first one that Gutfeld went into detail praising following the teen’s suit against The Washington Post as part of the media’s Covington smear:

First, there's Nick suing The Washington Post for 250 million bucks. It's a lot of money, but think about how much money they made off smearing him. The paper makes 100 million bucks off digital ad sales alone. That's a lot of money, a hundred million dollars. That's more than I make in a year. [LAUGHTER] How do they make all that money? Conflict — which brings eyeballs, which makes money, so I say Nick Sandmann, get your piece, you earned it. Without you, how would Chris Cuomo afford his daily waxing? [LAUGHTER] At least daily.

Gutfeld then teed up a clip of Logan on a podcast with former Navy SEAL Mike Ritland (click “expand”):

GUTFELD: Mmmm talk about speaking truth to power, which is why no one covered it, but us, because when the news embarrasses the news industry, it disappears faster than Taylor Swift's boyfriends. [LAUGHTER] Because once the Emperor's New Clothes are exposed, don't expect the Emperor to tell you about it. The Emperor is busy blaming Fox for eating people's lunches.

LOGAN: The media everywhere is mostly liberal, not just in the U.S., but in this country, 85 percent of journalists are registered Democrats. So that's just a fact, right. No one is registering Democrats when they’re rarely a Republican, so the facts are on the side of what you just stated, most journalists are — are left or liberal or Democrat.

GUTFELD: Now there's Smollett. Like Covington, it began with media-ready conflict spiraling into a hate tornado directed at the usual suspects, which is you. Remember, Covington was a white brat in a red hat. Smollett also tapped that hat. Sadly, it turns out his white racists were Nigerian bodybuilders. Oh ho ho! Check out this pair. Their abs have abs. [LAUGHTER] They've got more muscles than a mollusk convention. If I had access to those washboards, I’d be doing laundry every night of the week. [LAUGHTER] Smollett paid them 3,500 bucks to pull off this stunt, yet he makes 60 grand a show, so forget that he's a hoaxter. He's just a cheap [bleep]. [LAUGHTER] Now these cases along with the Brett Kavanaugh smear, they need to be part of a course. Call it Journalistic Ethics, something to take instead of Intersectional Gender Studies and I know who should teach it.

Before setting up clips of CNN personalities and the cast of The Real falling for the Smollett hoax, Gutfeld lambasted media types like that for having been “the same culprits....at the scene of every crime” of journalistic malpractice because they’re part of “the activist media, journalists driven by an agenda, and the profit-maker behind this machine is always conflict.”

Later in his monologue and before introducing his panelists, Gutfeld aired an over-the-top skit lampooning the kneejerk liberal media.

An announcer teed up the class (taught by Timpf) with this appeal: “Attention news professionals. Do the traditions of objective reporting bore you? Are you hungry for the profits that come with agenda-driven headlines? Then send your journalist to the Blame, Insinuate, Accuse Seminar.”

With a room of five faux liberal journalists, Timpf read aloud generic news headlines and encourages attendees to concoct a new one that makes it biased. Here were two examples (click “expand”):

GREG GUTFELD: What a bad week for the activist press. Smollett, Sandmann, Lara Logan — the three horsemen of the media apocalypse. They got every reporter pulling out their hair. Well, except for this guy. [PICTURE OF BRIAN STELTER] [LAUGHTER] I think he's already moved on to his back. First, there's Nick suing The Washington Post for 250 million bucks. It's a lot of money, but think about how much money they made off smearing him. The paper makes 100 million bucks off digital ad sales alone. That's a lot of money, a hundred million dollars. That's more than I make in a year. [LAUGHTER] How do they make all that money? Conflict — which brings eyeballs, which makes money, so I say Nick Sandmann, get your piece, you earned it. Without you, how would Chris Cuomo afford his daily waxing? [LAUGHTER] At least daily. Now there's Smollett. Like Covington, it began with media-ready conflict spiraling into a hate tornado directed at the usual suspects, which is you. Remember, Covington was a white brat in a red hat. Smollett also tapped that hat. Sadly, it turns out his white racists were Nigerian bodybuilders. Oh ho ho! Check out this pair. Their abs have abs. [LAUGHTER] They've got more muscles than a mollusk convention. If I had access to those washboards, I’d be doing laundry every night of the week. [LAUGHTER] Smollett paid them 3,500 bucks to pull off this stunt, yet he makes 60 grand a show, so forget that he's a hoaxter. He's just a cheap [bleep]. [LAUGHTER] Now these cases along with the Brett Kavanaugh smear, they need to be part of a course. Call it Journalistic Ethics, something to take instead of Intersectional Gender Studies and I know who should teach it.

LARA LOGAN: The media everywhere is mostly liberal, not just in the U.S., but in this country, 85 percent of journalists are registered Democrats. So that's just a fact, right. No one is registering Democrats when they’re rarely a Republican, so the facts are on the side of what you just stated, most journalists are — are left or liberal or Democrat.

GUTFELD: Mmmm talk about speaking truth to power, which is why no one covered it, but us, because when the news embarrasses the news industry, it disappears faster than Taylor Swift's boyfriends. [LAUGHTER] Because once the Emperor's New Clothes are exposed, don't expect the Emperor to tell you about it. The Emperor is busy blaming Fox for eating people's lunches.

DON LEMON: Sean Hannity is going to eat Jussie Smollett's lunch every single second. Tucker Carlson is going to eat Jussie Smollett's lunch every single second. The President of the United States is going to eat his lunch.

GUTFELD: I'm getting hungry. So that's the concern. We're going to dine on Smollett, no Lemon, we're dining on you. You believed him because you already believe Donald Trump supporters were racist. Smollett served a purpose for you and you served a purpose for him. Smollett saw the media for what it was — suckers — and I kind of admire it, but if you're only lesson is that Smollett was being used by us as fodder while missing the fact that he made you look like a dumbass, then you truly are a lemon. Since 2016, these media fail moments have been piling up and the same culprits are at the scene of every crime. It's the activist media, journalists driven by an agenda, and the profit-maker behind this machine is always conflict.

RYAN YOUNG [on CNN Newsroom with Brooke Baldwin, 01/29/19]: The idea that racial slurs, and maybe even some of the homophobic slurs being used toward him. You can see how serious this crime is right now.

BROOKE BALDWIN [on CNN Newsroom with Brooke Baldwin, 01/29/19]: Absolutely despicable.

SARA SIDNER [on CNN’s New Day, 01/29/19]: Smollett in real life is black and gay, which may have been the motivation for a possible hate crime against him in Chicago.

JEANNIE MAI [on The Real, 01/31/19]: I'm disgusted by people who wear hats that same MAGA.

LONI LOVE [on The Real, 01/31/19]: I don't believe Jussie is making this up.

TAMERA MOWRY [on The Real, 01/31/19]: I don't like that it's being put out there in the media that this is a “possible” hate crime.

BALDWIN [on CNN Newsroom with Brooke Baldwin, 01/29/19]: This is America in 2019.

GUTFELD: Ah, you wish. Celebs also dove in placing the blame where it belonged. Of course, on Pence.

ELLEN PAGE [on CBS’s The Late Show, 01/31/19]: It feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and the Vice President Mike Pence who like wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear. Connect the dots. This is what happens. If you we're in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them. You go through the trouble. You spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen?

GUTFELD: Well, she should know. I tried to sit through her last movie. That's suffering. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Anyway, I wonder if Colbert will have her back on to discuss how Pence didn't help create a crime that didn't exist. Meanwhile, we all here held our tongues even though the story stank like the bathroom after curry night at the rest home. [LAUGHTER] Trump — I mean, Trump supporters stalking the Chicago streets in subzero temperatures at 2:00 a.m., carrying a noose running into some nobody actor on a show they don't watch and somehow recognizing him? Then beating him up without taking his wallet, phone or sandwich. This seems it's possible. It's me being hired as a babysitter. They didn't even take a sandwich. This seemed as possible as me being hired as a babysitter. [LAUGHTER] They didn't even take his sandwich. It was a Subway and they're delicious. Maybe that Smollett's next gig, Subway spokesman. It's a step up from Jared. [LAUGHTER] By the way, he paid the Nigerians with a check. I mean, who still writes checks? Maybe your aunt on your birthday? Thanks for the card, Aunt Edna and the $10.00, but Smollett was the perfect victim for a media that wanted this so badly to be true. So why are these hoaxes so common? Here's my thinking. All of those folks who went to college in the last decade or so are now employed in the media, and they brought with them the victimhood virus they were infected with on campus. The virus makes you stupid, naive, gullible, did I say stupid? Yes, I did. Anyway, some people are sad Smollett was a hoax. Not me, I'm always thrilled when a hate crime turns out to be false, which means I'm thrilled a lot. It means that we aren't as racist as the media wants us to be and we live in a country where hate crimes have to be made up because the demand for hate crimes exceeds the supply, but if you're still sad, this was a hoax, it is only because it exposes how your activist bias sets you up as a willing stooge. The media owns this story. It's like they took a course on it.

ANNOUNCER: Attention news professionals. Do the traditions of objective reporting bore you? Are you hungry for the profits that come with agenda-driven headlines? Then send your journalist to the Blame, Insinuate, Accuse Seminar.

KATHERINE TIMPF: Now, I'm going to show you some headlines and you're going tell me how you would rewrite them for maximum profit. Okay, here's the first one. “Snowstorm Expected to Blanket North East.”

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: “Whites Ski, The Rest Freeze as Snowstorm Reveals Weather Inequality.”

TIMPF: Nice. All right, here's another one. “Midwest Man Wins Mega Millions Jackpot.”

SALLY: Oh, “Man Wins Lottery — No Surprise To The 3.2 Billion Women Who Didn't Win The Lottery.”

TIMPF: Snappy. I love it. Sally, you're a natural. All right. How about this one. “World War II Vet Celebrates 95th Birthday.”

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: “Elderly White Lifelong Republican Voter Turns 95 Thanks to Russian Collusion.”

TIMPF: Nailed it. Alright. Next one. “Church Youth Group Holds Bake Sale For Flood Victims.”

SALLY: Oh — “Extremists Use Religion To Poison Victims With Heart-Clogging Toxins.”

TIMPF: Yes. Okay. “Multi-Car Accident In Toronto Freeway.”

TIMPF: “House Fire in Australia Injures Seven.”

SALLY: “House Fire In Australia Injures Seven....ONLY IN TRUMP’S AMERICA.”

TIMPF: “Volcano Erupts In Brazil, Many Injured.”

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: “Volcano Erupts in Brazil. Many injured....ONLY IN TRUMP’S AMERICA.”

Jussie Smollett has been given special permission to leave Illinois while he awaits trial.

A Chicago judge told the embattled “Empire” star on Monday that he’s allowed to travel to New York and California to meet with his legal team, but nowhere else.

Smollett is facing disorderly conduct charges for filing a false police report and allegedly staging a racist and homophobic attack. The 36-year-old actor, who is gay and black, has denied the allegations against him. He is currently out on bond.

Smollett had been prohibited from leaving the state without getting permission from the judge in his case. He is allowed to attend meetings with his attorneys, but can’t leave the country.

His next court date is March 14.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's attorneys, who say he's innocent.

Kavanagh says attorney Mark Geragos, who's based in Los Angeles, is Smollett's lead attorney. She says a defense lawyer asked Monday that Smollett be allowed to travel to California and New York for meetings with his legal team.

Chicago police charged Smollett with disorderly conduct. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett, who is black and gay, staged a racist and homophobic attack , then told police his attackers yelled racial and anti-gay slurs and referenced President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

He was released last week after posting $10,000 cash. He was ordered to surrender his passport.

The Oscars celebrated diversity with a string of wins for minority nominees, but the night's message was undermined by a bitter controversy simmering Monday over the best picture winner, civil rights dramedy ""Green Book.""

The victory for Peter Farrelly's true-life story of a gay black pianist who strikes up an unlikely friendship with his Italian-American driver in 1960s America lit up social media, sparking a savage backlash over what critics see as its ""whitesplaining"" racial politics.

Veteran African American filmmaker Spike Lee stormed briefly out of the auditorium as the top prize at the 91st Academy Awards was announced on Sunday, later hinting that he thought it was a historically poor choice.

Lee was dumbfounded back in 1990 when ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" a movie deemed by many to be egregiously tone deaf on race, won best picture while his widely lauded ""Do the Right Thing"" couldn't even muster a nomination.

Three decades later, Lee was in the running for best film with ""BlacKkKlansman"" and appeared exasperated to lose to another film about race relations set largely in a car.

""BlacKkKlansman"" director Spike Lee, pictured with his best original screenplay Oscar, described himself as 'snakebit'

""I'm snakebit -- every time someone's driving someone, I lose,"" Lee half-joked backstage, visibly frustrated despite taking home a consolation prize -- an Oscar for screenwriting, his first in a competitive category.

An evening overshadowed by a controversy over race had a fitting coda when Lee -- after pleading for US voters to ""be on the right side of history"" when they vote in the 2020 presidential election -- took a Twitter beating from Donald Trump.

""Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President,"" Trump tweeted Monday, although he hadn't been named by the director.

- 'Repellently obtuse' -

The top prize -- the third statuette of the night for ""Green Book"" -- came after its star Mahershala Ali, an African American and two years ago the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar, bagged the prize for best supporting actor.

Oscar winners and nominees

The film, an audience favorite that has taken more than $140 million in box offices worldwide, it has been embroiled in controversy since its premiere.

The real-life family of Ali's character, the late pianist Don Shirley, denounced the film as a ""symphony of lies"" while others described it as yet another ""white savior movie.""

Ali's co-star Viggo Mortensen was hardly a balm to the roiling controversy when, during a Q&A on the film in November, he used the N-word.

On the surface, the academy's selections on Sunday looked about as diverse as could be expected, with superhero blockbuster ""Black Panther,"" a movie with a mainly black cast, scooping three awards.

Three of the four acting prizes went to African Americans and an Egyptian first-generation American, while black women won in costume design and production design for the first time, both for ""Black Panther.""

Richard Brody argued in The New Yorker, however, that the ""repellently obtuse"" ""Green Book"" proved the academy had changed nothing meaningful since being berated over the 2016-17 #OscarsSoWhite controversy.

- 'Woke liberals' -

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found that the ""well-intentioned white/black balance"" came across as glib, while the London-based Independent website bemoaned its ""relentless, almost uncanny mediocrity.""

Oscar winner Mahershala Ali, who won the best supporting actor prize for ""Green Book,"" took one of three statuettes for the film including best picture

As is often the case, there was a backlash to the backlash, from commentators complaining of an industry crippled by its fear of offending audiences and an obsession with the appearance of political correctness rather than genuine reform.

""No matter how woke you go it's never. good. enough,"" tweeted Claire Lehmann, the founding editor of online magazine Quillette.

Conservative entertainment blog Hollywood in Toto, which considers Tinseltown's liberals as something of a bete noire, described the bonding theme in ""Green Book"" as ""noble.""

""Saying movies like 'Green Book' make white movie goers feel better is insulting,"" said editor Christian Toto. ""Why would you need to be white to enjoy a beautifully told story about moving past one's bigotry?""

Toto evoked the allegedly faked recent hate attack on black ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett to argue that the US movie industry is often too quick to see racism where none exists.

The annual UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report, published last week, noted that the ever-broadening landscape created by Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and other streaming services had ""created a tailwind"" for racial diversity.

The number of minority actors with lead roles in films increased from 13.9 percent in 2016 to 19.8 percent in 2017 -- a far from perfect statistic but a sizeable improvement, nonetheless.

""It sounds absurd to suggest people who claim to be against racism, like woke liberals in and out of Hollywood, would be against a film that promotes racial healing,"" said Toto."

AD

The cartoon, published Friday, depicted successive portraits of Baldwin, Morrison and Smollett beneath the caption, “Famous African-American Storytellers.”

AD

“I consider the cartoon offensive and not in line with our values as a company,” Light wrote. Matthew T. Hall, the paper’s editorial and opinion director, also apologized for the cartoon.

“I ultimately agree with the decision to pull the cartoon because enough thoughtful people have told me they find it offensive,” Breen, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, told The Washington Post. “I’m frustrated with myself because I feel with a few tweaks, the cartoon could have been salvaged, but I’m not exactly sure what those would be.

“Maybe with the wording. Maybe with James Baldwin and Toni Morrison saying something to Jussie Smollett. I’m not sure — maybe nothing could have made it inoffensive.” Breen said he was attempting to satirize Smollett through the incongruity of the cartoon’s roster.

“The problem is, I was trying to contrast Jussie Smollett with James Baldwin and Toni Morrison, and people read it as a comparison,” says Breen, who notes that going forward, he will more carefully vet his cartoons involving race.

On the Andrews McMeel Syndication website that carries Breen, some commenters called the cartoon’s grouping of names a “disrespectful” and an “intellectually dishonest comparison” that appeared to “trivialize the greatness of two people.”

One reader said: “Your cartoon clearly positioned Baldwin and Morrison as if they were part of a police line-up with Smollett. At first- and at even second glance, with little knowledge of these literary geniuses or of Smollett’s story, they all look guilty of ‘storytelling.’ "" Another reader, though, wrote: “I saw the cartoon as contrast and not comparison right away. Although I can see how it could be taken offensively I didn’t get that vibe from Steve Breen’s work. An explanation not an apology would have sufficed.”

Morrison has received the Pulitzer Prize, the Nobel Prize for literature, the Coretta Scott King Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her writing, including the “Beloved” trilogy, “Song of Solomon” and “The Bluest Eye.”

Wessler speaks onstage alongside the cast and crew of ‘Green Book’ after the film won the Best Picture award at the 91st Academy Awards, February 25, 2019. ― Reuters pic

LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 — The Oscars celebrated diversity with a string of wins for minority nominees, but the night’s message was undermined by a bitter controversy simmering yesterday over the best picture winner, civil rights dramedy Green Book.

The victory for Peter Farrelly’s true-life story of a gay black pianist who strikes up an unlikely friendship with his Italian-American driver in 1960s America lit up social media, sparking a savage backlash over what critics see as its “whitesplaining” racial politics.

Veteran African American filmmaker Spike Lee stormed briefly out of the auditorium as the top prize at the 91st Academy Awards was announced on Sunday, later hinting that he thought it was a historically poor choice.

Lee was dumbfounded back in 1990 when Driving Miss Daisy, a movie deemed by many to be egregiously tone deaf on race, won best picture while his widely lauded Do the Right Thing couldn’t even muster a nomination.

Three decades later, Lee was in the running for best film with BlacKkKlansman and appeared exasperated to lose to another film about race relations set largely in a car.

“I’m snakebit — every time someone’s driving someone, I lose,” Lee half-joked backstage, visibly frustrated despite taking home a consolation prize — an Oscar for screenwriting, his first in a competitive category.

An evening overshadowed by a controversy over race had a fitting coda when Lee — after pleading for US voters to “be on the right side of history” when they vote in the 2020 presidential election — took a Twitter beating from Donald Trump.

“Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President,” Trump tweeted yesterday, although he hadn’t been named by the director.

‘Repellently obtuse’

The top prize — the third statuette of the night for Green Book — came after its star Mahershala Ali, an African American and two years ago the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar, bagged the prize for best supporting actor.

The film, an audience favourite that has taken more than US$140 million (RM569.6 million) in box offices worldwide, it has been embroiled in controversy since its premiere.

The real-life family of Ali’s character, the late pianist Don Shirley, denounced the film as a “symphony of lies” while others described it as yet another “white saviour movie.”

Ali’s co-star Viggo Mortensen was hardly a balm to the roiling controversy when, during a Q&A on the film in November, he used the N-word.

On the surface, the academy’s selections on Sunday looked about as diverse as could be expected, with superhero blockbuster Black Panther, a movie with a mainly black cast, scooping three awards.

Three of the four acting prizes went to African Americans and an Egyptian first-generation American, while black women won in costume design and production design for the first time, both for Black Panther.

Richard Brody argued in The New Yorker, however, that the “repellently obtuse” Green Book proved the academy had changed nothing meaningful since being berated over the 2016-17 #OscarsSoWhite controversy.

‘Woke liberals’

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found that the “well-intentioned white/black balance” came across as glib, while the London-based Independent website bemoaned its “relentless, almost uncanny mediocrity.”

As is often the case, there was a backlash to the backlash, from commentators complaining of an industry crippled by its fear of offending audiences and an obsession with the appearance of political correctness rather than genuine reform.

“No matter how woke you go it’s never. good. enough,” tweeted Claire Lehmann, the founding editor of online magazine Quillette.

Conservative entertainment blog Hollywood in Toto, which considers Tinseltown’s liberals as something of a bete noire, described the bonding theme in Green Book as “noble.”

“Saying movies like Green Book make white movie goers feel better is insulting,” said editor Christian Toto. “Why would you need to be white to enjoy a beautifully told story about moving past one’s bigotry?”

Toto evoked the allegedly faked recent hate attack on black Empire actor Jussie Smollett to argue that the US movie industry is often too quick to see racism where none exists.

The annual UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report, published last week, noted that the ever-broadening landscape created by Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and other streaming services had “created a tailwind” for racial diversity.

The number of minority actors with lead roles in films increased from 13.9 percent in 2016 to 19.8 percent in 2017 — a far from perfect statistic but a sizeable improvement, nonetheless.

“It sounds absurd to suggest people who claim to be against racism, like woke liberals in and out of Hollywood, would be against a film that promotes racial healing,” said Toto. — AFP-Relaxnews"

But, look, I figure it this way: better to be king for a night, than schmuck for a lifetime.”

—Robert DeNiro’s “Rupert Pupkin” character in The King of Comedy.

If I were in charge of the Criterion Collection, I’d rush a super-deluxe Blu-Ray version of Martin Scorsese’s 1982 movie The King of Comedy into production. Because the Jussie Smollett story, assuming no last-minute twist ending yet appears to exonerate Smollett, feels very much like an ultra “woke” sequel to Scorsese’s controversial movie:

Unlike DeNiro’s pathetic Rupert Pupkin character, performing stand-up in his mother’s basement, Smollett already established a strong foothold in Hollywood, as his IMDB Q.V. illustrates. However, one of his goals, according to Chicago PD, in his alleged staging of the incident in “MAGA Country” in late January, was to increase his salary on the Fox series Empire, and presumably, push himself a few notches up the celebrity food chain.

Here however, Scorsese’s movie and Smollett’s story differ in a crucial aspect: Pupkin became a superstar at the conclusion of The King of Comedy through infamy. He kidnapped a talk show host obviously based on Johnny Carson, and as part of his ransom, demands that he be allowed to perform his bizarre stand-up routine on his show. The audience love the routine, and after getting out of prison, Pupkin’s autobiography becomes a surprise best-seller. It’s the world of Jerry Springer, nearly a decade before Springer’s show debuted.

Smollett has become infamous himself, but he was hoping that what John McWhorter of the Atlantic dubbed “victimhood chic” would do the same for his career as kidnapping did for DeNiro’s character, which itself illustrates how the largely establishment leftist overculture has mutated since 1982. And based on the massive initial outpouring of support from the overlapping worlds of showbiz, old media, and Democratic Party politics, Smollett was well on his way to superstardom, until his story collapsed.

But outside of local Chicago reporters, much of old media was willing to play along with Smollett’s claims, including Don Lemon of CNN, who reported texting Smollett daily. Just as The King of Comedy contrasts how we as TV viewers perceive what we see on slick, sanitized network broadcasts versus a much messier reality, the Smollett story allows us at least one opportunity to see how a television news anchor handles news, versus how she performs on a fictitious show. As NewsBusters’ Tim Graham spotted last week:

On Tuesday, the website The Blast reported that ABC staffers were immediately concerned about Jussie Smollett’s claims after he appeared for a Robin Roberts interview on Good Morning America. They reported that Smollett specifically requested that Roberts handle the interview because the two knew each other from when she appeared on an episode of Empire that aired last year. So let’s take a look. On the April 11, 2018 episode, Roberts was much tougher on fictional Jamal Lyon (played by Smollett) than she was on Smollett in real life!

But of course! Smollett’s a celebrity — he deserves that special glad-handing, even from the world of “objective” “news.” Rupert would understand perfectly.

Hollywood Versus the Red State Menace

Modern audiences would likely find the lack of any sort of political motivation for DeNiro’s character to be a curious omission from Scorsese’s film. He’s simply desperate for that big break that goes along with appearing on the Johnny Carson-style talk show hosted by Jerry Lewis’ “Jerry Langford” character. Similarly, in real-life, Carson’s show, in order to maintain its then-massive viewing numbers, was legendary for its gentle touch towards politics and politicians, despite Carson’s own establishment left worldview.

Today, Hollywood uses the right, and Trump voters in particular, as pawns to advance its agenda — though this approach can backfire as well. In 2006, when Brokeback Mountain failed to top the $100 million mark in America, Mark Steyn wrote, “The more artful leftie websites have taken to complaining that the religious right deliberately killed Brokeback at the box-office by declining to get mad about it.” More recently, the director of “Lady Ghostbusters” hoped to use the right’s indignation to drive box office, until people of all ideological worldviews came together united in a common theme — that the underlying film sucked very badly. (See also: Star Wars: The Force Awakens.)

In contrast, Smollett took an absurd double standard — that MAGA hat wearing Trump supporters view Empire as some sort of Sodom and Gomorrah-esque den of homosexual filth, and yet tune in every week to the point where they know who the heck Smollett is, and were prepared to jump him on a bone-chillingly cold Chicago night at 2:00 am. Or as Jim Treacher wrote on January 31st, “Like most Americans, I reacted to the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett by alleged Trump supporters, who were allegedly screaming MAGA slogans, by asking one simple question: Who in the world is Jussie Smollett?”

Now that he is indeed a household name, as with Pupkin eventually achieving his goal, it’s still entirely possible that Smollett could use his alleged hoax to leapfrog himself into a higher career status, or at least steady TV work, perhaps after the typical celebrity Oprah-approved reputation rehab tour. Certainly, being an unabashed hater of Republicans since at least 1998 has done wonders to keep Alec Baldwin steadily employed on television, long after his brief run as a matinee idol faded. If so, it will prove once again how prescient the theme of Scorsese’s movie was: it doesn’t matter what you do to enter show business, if the amount of fame — or infamy — your debut stunt causes, your fame and fortune will be assured afterwards. Just ask Al Sharpton, another television fixture whose career accelerated into the ionosphere via a faked hate crime."

A conspiracy theory that presidential hopeful Senator Kamala Harris aided actor Jussie Smollett’s alleged attempts to fake a hate crime have spread across Twitter and Facebook, Storyful reported, based on an analysis of traffic on the sites.

Smollett was arrested last week on suspicion of filing a false police report that he had been assaulted by two MAGA-hat wearing Trump supporters. On Thursday, February 21, the day the Chicago police held a press conference on Smollett’s case, Storyful found a large number of social media posts mentioning Smollett, Harris and another candidate for president, Senator Corey Booker.

The posts falsely claimed that Smollett, who is Jewish, and Harris are related, or that Smollett had coordinated his fake assault with Harris and Booker so as to boost her anti-lynching bill. Smollett famously reported that the two men placed a noose around his neck.

People who spread the theory pointed to the fact that both Booker and Harris called the assault on Smollett a “modern day lynching” on the day it was first reported.

Storyful found that the theory about collusion between Smollett, Harris and Booker were incubated on 4chan, the fringe forum site; Gab, the micro-blogging service similar to Twitter where hate speech is common; and Reddit. A tweet from Conservative actor James Woods amplified the theory considerably."

Guilty or not guilty? Many people have been trying to figure if Jussie Smollett is either one. Many people have been finding it hard to determine if Jussie staged his own brutal attack or if he’s actually the victim here.

RELATED: Jussie Smollett Reportedly Did Not Pay Brothers $3K For Attack

Although he’s been charged for falsifying a police report, and has maintained his innocence, Chicago’s top cop said Monday that there’s “a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet” in the actor’s case that proves he actually staged his attack.

“Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, that does not support the version he gave,” Johnson said. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply doesn’t support his version of what happened.”

In addition to that, Johnson also fired back against recent reports stating that the $3,500 check at the center of the case was really a payment from Smollett to bodybuilding brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo for training sessions.

“They [the brothers] said that he paid them $3,500 with a check … to carry out this incident,” Johnson insisted. He also made it clears, “It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something, it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this,” he added.

Jussie Smollett was charged with 16 felony counts of falsifying a police report before all charges were dropped. However, the Chicago Police Department was outraged, slamming Smollett and Cook County’s first and only Black woman State’s Attorney Kim Foxx. The law enforcement agency is convinced Smollett is not guilty even though that decision only falls into the hands of the jury — and there was no trial. That said, the Chicago Police Department appears to only trust the criminal justice system when it’s on their side.

Fast forward nearly one year and the disgraced now-former Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson — the same one who wanted Smollett behind bars — has been fired for lying about a drunken night behind the wheel with a woman who is not his wife.

All of which gets us to this brief but necessary reminder of why we should always question the notoriously corrupt Chicago Police Department.

Fred Hampton is one of the most iconic cases of deplorable behavior from the Chicago police. On Dec. 4, 1969, Hampton — a 21-year-old chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party (BPP) — and Mark Clark — a 22-year-old Peoria Panther leader — were murdered by Chicago police officers working with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. At the time of the attack, Hampton and Clark were neither inciting violence nor were they having a standoff with police. Instead, they were both asleep inside their Chicago home.

Driven by then-Cook County State’s Attorney Edward Hanrahan, the deadly raid of the local BPP chapter — which left four other BPP members severely injured — was one of multiple attempts to attack the BPP amid Cointelpro’s mission to “expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist hate type organizations and groupings, their leadership, spokesmen, membership and supporters,” as written in an FBI document.

“Despite the evidence provided by ballistics experts showing that police had fired 99 percent of the bullets and had falsified the report on the incident, the first federal grand jury did not indict anyone involved in the raid,” History.com wrote. “Furthermore, even though a subsequent grand jury did indict all the police officers involved, the charges were dismissed.”

Now, years later, there is the horrific story of Laquan McDonald. On October 20, 2014, video of the 17-year-old’s killing appeared to show then-Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke firing at him 16 times within 14 seconds. The video was released one year after McDonald’s death and showed the teen walking away instead of confronting officers, which is what Van Dyke falsely said happened. McDonald continued to be shot at even after he fell to the ground from the initial bullets.

Two police officers and one detective were acquitted of trying to cover up the shooting for Van Dyke, even though that was precisely what they did. The three men all said Van Dyke, who was found guilty in October, was justified in shooting the teenager 16 times within 14 seconds. Van Dyke’s partner the night of the shooting, even said: “McDonald was walking toward Van Dyke and with his arms raised when he was shot.” The video would later contradict that account, showing Walsh lied. Still, he and his co-defendants were acquitted.

More than four years after killing McDonald, Van Dyke was given the light sentence of 81 months in prison. However, it is reported he will probably only serve three to four years.

As for Smollett, the Chicago Police Department appeared to drop the ball from the beginning with its handling of the case in the media. First, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants. Then, hours later, there were two “persons of interest” on video. They also claimed the “Empire” actor “refused” to give the cops his phone, but he did give his phone records. Now the FBI is reportedly saying Johnson, the recently fired Chicago police superintendent, went “too far” and “overstated” the case against Jussie. That led to Johnson going on “Good Morning America” on appearing to try to do damage control.

Last week, the Empire actor was arrested and charged by authorities in Chicago for filing a false police report after allegedly staging a hate crime against himself.

The evidence seems overwhelming with the two men who allegedly perpetrated the attack telling police they were hired by Smollett and providing receipts for the rope and masks used in the assault and a cheque Smollett gave them for $3,500. Despite all that, however, Jussie’s onscreen dad, Terrence Howard, is still supporting and defending his son.

On Sunday, Howard posted a video of Jussie to Instagram with the caption, “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you.”

The post, understandably, sparked an online frenzy with people questioning Howard’s unwavering support. In response to one commenter’s criticism, the actor wrote a lengthy message saying it isn’t anyone’s place to judge Smollett and that Jussie couldn’t possibly be capable of doing what the police allege.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know. The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly,” Howard wrote. “His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Smollett has maintained his innocence since people first began questioning his story earlier this month. He claims that two masked men attacked him in the early morning on January 29th, beat him, wrapped a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him and called him racist and homophobic slurs before yelling, “This is MAGA country.” He reported the incident shortly after it happened.

A number of inconsistencies and suspicious details slowly led portions of the public to question the accuracy of Smollett’s account. Most notably, people found it suspicious that there was no footage of the attack since Chicago has an extensive surveillance system.

Last week, Chicago PD shared that Smollett had become a suspect in his own case and a few days later, they arrested the actor. Smollett still claims the assault was not a hoax but after posting his $100,000 bail, he returned to the set of Empire to apologize to the cast and crew for all the drama this has caused. After the arrest, Fox made the decision to remove Jussie’s character, Jamal Lyon, from the rest of the season, but said they were still weighing options with regards to the ultimate future of the character."

According to TMZ, sources say Thursday production erupted into chaos after castmates found out Smollett had turned himself into Chicago police and was being charged. Howard is said to have been so upset he went on a strike of sorts, refusing to come out of his trailer for majority of the day.

Howard had lost his patience with Smollett after police announced two Nigerian-American brothers, Abel and Ola Osundario, had allegedly helped his costar stage a massive hoax. A screaming Howard allegedly confronted Smollett demanding that he end the charade and come clean.

Howard was noticeably absent Thursday evening when when Smollett addressed the cast and crew, although it was said that those who did show up were skeptical of him as well. The sources say the anger and confusion on set caused by the actor’s presence is what ultimately convinced producers to remove him from the last two episodes.

However, a report has come forward that suggests Chicago Police may have had a key detail in the case wrong when they said a $3500 check Smollett wrote was a payoff for the attack. TMZ reported that the money went to the brothers as a fee for training. Still, Chicago’s police chief Eddie Johnson doubled down on his assertion that the check was, in fact. a payoff to stage the attack.

On Saturday Howard posted a video that was seemingly in support of Jussie.

Johnson, the Chicago Police Superintendent that’s been spearheading the Jussie Smollett investigation, sat down with “Good Morning America’s” Robin Roberts on Monday and said investigators have more evidence that prove the actor is lying.

Last month Smollett said he was beaten by two white men near his Chicago apartment in a racist and homophobic attack, but afterward police said he staged the whole thing by hiring brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo.

After authorities said Smollett paid them $3,500 to attack him, reports later surfaced that Smollett claims money was for fitness training, an explanation Johnson shot down.

The police superintendent also answered those who pointed to the CPD’s long history of racism as evidence that Smollett might not get a fair shake in the investigation. Director Ava DuVernay was one of celebrity who advanced that idea.

“It’s not the Chicago police who said he did something, it’s the evidence, facts and the witnesses [who] are saying this,” Johnson stated.

Afterwards, the superintendent spoke about being offended by Smollett’s claim that a noose was tied around his neck in the attack, which is something he first addressed during a press conference last week after the actor was arrested for felony disorderly conduct.

“I grew up in the tail end of the civil rights era, and I lived in Cabrini-Green housing project, and the symbolism of a noose is very offensive,” he explained. “The Chicago Police Department has its issues on racism and excessive force and all of that. I’m acutely aware of that, but we didn’t earn this particular incident, and I refuse for us to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary.”

Johnson then said that he hopes victims of real attacks don’t suffer because of the “Empire” actor, whom he has said has a lot more evidence on.

“I just hope people don’t judge other folks that are victims of these types of crimes because this is just one particular incident,” he stated. “There are real victims of crimes of that nature, hate crimes and I just hope people don’t treat them with skepticism.”

“There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that does not support the version that he gave us,” Johnson added. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that simply doesn’t support his version of what happened.”

Howard, who plays Smollett's father on the 20th Century Fox show, reportedly locked himself in his trailer and did not speak to anyone when Smollett was taken into custody for allegedly filing a false police report.

TMZ cites anonymous production sources who say Howard, 49, was beside himself and had never believed Smollett's story that he was randomly attacked in the street.

They say he had been questioning Smollett about it because he did not think it added up.

But something over the last few days appears to have changed his mind.

Terrence Howard had a 'meltdown' on the set of Empire when Jussie Smollett was arrested on Thursday and refused to come out of his trailer, according to production sources

On Sunday, he shared an Instagram video of Smollett playing with his toddler son on board a private jet and wrote: 'All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you.'

Smollett went straight to the set of Empire on Thursday after posting $10,000 in bail money.

He begged the cast to forgive him for the scandal the alleged attack has caused, and insisted he was innocent, telling them: 'I swear to God, I did not do this.'

It has since emerged that the check he gave brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo for $3,500 was titled as payment for a nutrition and workout program.

Police said that was the brothers' fee for staging the attack on January 29.

The check was backdated to January 23 and in the memo section, Smollett wrote: '5 week nutrition/workout plan.'

He was trying to lose weight for an upcoming appearance in a music video, it was claimed.

The Chicago Police Department is however adamant he made the attack up.

On Monday morning, Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson went on Good Morning America to insist upon Smollett's guilt.

Howard shared this video of Smollett playing with his son on a private jet on Sunday on Instagram

He captioned the video with a supportive message which suggests he now believes Smollett's story

'He still has the presumption of evidence and he'll get his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route,' Johnson said, rejecting Smollett's lawyers claim that he has been unfairly vilified by the police department and prosecutor's office.

'I can tell you this, there's a lot more evidence that has not been presented yet that does not support his version of the incident.

'There is still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that simply does not support his version.

'It's not the Chicago PD saying he did something. It's the evidence, the facts and the witnesses saying this,' he added.

Johnson, who eviscerated the Empire star during a press conference last week after he was arrested, said he was careful throughout the investigation not to jump to the conclusion that Smollett was involved despite growing suspicion among detectives.

Smollett plays Howard's son on the show. Taraji Henson, who is his on-screen mother, has not commented on the controversy

'I refused to let Chicago Police Department categorize him as a suspect until we had solid evidence,' he said.

Johnson also said he was 'acutely aware' of the police department's reputation for being racist, which Smollett supporters have invoked in their defense of him, but that it played no role in this investigation.

'Something like this can be really damaging. We have made a lot of progress in the last three years in terms of race relations.

'We're heading in the right direction in terms but are we where we want to be? Of course not,' he said.

Johnson added that he did not want Smollett's case to act as a deterrent to true victims of hate crimes, saying: 'This is just one incident...there are real victims of crimes of that nature, hate crimes, and I just hope people don't treat them with skepticism.

'This is one particular incident and it has to stand on its own merits,' he said.

This is the check Jussie Smollett paid Abimbola 'Abel' Osundairo to allegedly beat him on January 29.He backdated it to January 23, according to police. Smollett labeled it '5 week nutrition/workout program' but the brothers say it was for the attack

Jussie Smollett is shown in his mugshot on February 21. He maintains he is innocent

'The City of Chicago has its issues. The CPD has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that and I am acutely aware of it.

'[But] we didn't earn this incident and i refuse to let us have to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary.

'It's my responsibility to make sure the record gets set straight.'

He added that it was 'offensive' that Smollett included the claim that a noose was put around his neck by his attackers in his story, given its significance as a symbol of racism.

'I grew up in the tail end of the civil rights era... the symbolism of a noose is very offensive,' he said.

After his arrest last week, the Cook County State's Attorney's office revealed some of the evidence it had against Smollett at an extraordinary press conference in court.

Sometime between Sunday night and Monday morning, swastikas were found in black marker beneath a slide at Brighton Playground in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn.

The symbols were found just days after dozens of swastikas, a Nazi eagle, and ""Hail Hitler"" (sic) were drawn in chalk on the pavement of a Queens schoolyard.

The NYPD's hate crime task force is investigating the two incidents, according to CNN .

A New York City councilman, Chaim Deutsch, called on Mayor Bill de Blasio to create a Hate Crime Prevention Office.

""Are swastikas in playgrounds the new normal?"" Deutsch tweeted Monday morning. ""Enough is enough. It's way past time to #TakeAction. @NYCMayor- please implement Hate Crime Prevention Office!""

""I am horrified, disgusted, and nauseated, to say the least, of what I have witnessed today. Nazi imagery and anti-Semitic slurs were drawn at the PS 139 Playground in Rego Park. I was on the scene today and most of the imagery has been washed away. Enough is enough!"" Karen Koslowitz tweeted.

Hate crimes have been a topic of discussion lately, especially in Chicago where ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett allegedly faked an attack on himself.

Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed the attack was a hate crime carried out by two Trump-supporting white men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs while beating him up, tying a rope around his beck, and throwing bleach on him."

The 39-year-old exec hastily deleted it, but within moments, the image was re-posted. Then it was on her company’s website and soon, her personal Facebook page.

Over the next month and a half, no matter how many times she changed her passwords, nude photos of her began popping up on her other social media accounts and even made it onto her company’s Twitter page.

“I’m a single mom living in New York City. I’m a business owner. What did they want from me? What’s next?’’ the woman, who asked not to be identified, told The Post.

It turned out that the accused culprit was the woman’s 49-year-old ex-boyfriend, Ross Glick — and thanks to New York City’s new “revenge porn” law, the former beau was arrested.

Glick, busted by NYPD Detective Denis McCarthy, whom the woman calls her hero, was charged with unlawful use of a computer and unlawfully posting the lewd images. He ended up pleading guilty to second-degree harassment, a violation, and paid a fine.

“We really are very happy that the justice system is taking things seriously for the first time … so many [victims] are able to get some protection and some relief because of the fact we passed this law,” said City Councilman Rory Lancman (D-Queens), the 2017 legislation’s sponsor.

Still, passage of the city law — which makes the dissemination of a nude image without a person’s consent a crime in the five boroughs — is bittersweet.

In New York state, aside from the five boroughs and Suffolk County, LI, authorities’ hands are tied when it comes to prosecuting revenge-porn perpetrators.

Despite Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s renewed promise in his 2019 State of the State address to prioritize the bill’s passage, New York is still one of nine states in the country that allows non-consensual photography, after its legislature defeated the bill — five times.

“Given that so many cases have been happening in the city, I think it shines a light that we finally need to get something done in Albany, and we’re optimistic with the new Democratic Senate, things will be different this year,” said Assemblyman Edward Braunstein (D-Bayside), who originally created the state bill.

“The city of New York has 9 million people, and the state has nearly 20 million people. If you look at it through those numbers, you can get a guess of how many criminal cases we’ll see.”

The city law, barely a year old, has already helped at least 143 victims hold their abusers accountable in some ways.

Fifty-three cases involving the crime were heard in Manhattan courts, 39 in the Bronx, 28 in Brooklyn, 22 in Queens and one on Staten Island as of the end of December.

The victims’ stories carry a recurring theme: intimate images splashed across social media and sent to families and employers, often just one of the weapons in a domestic abuser’s arsenal used to coerce victims into staying in relationships gone horribly wrong.

When a 24-year-old college student tried to break up with her longtime boyfriend, Mordechai Salem, last April, he began calling and texting her dozens of times, the woman told The Post.

When the young woman didn’t return his calls, he sent a video of the two of them having sex to her mother and threatened to post it to a porn website with her social media profile, she said in court papers.

“That was the worst moment of my life. I thought I was going to kill myself,” said the woman, who asked not to be identified. “It felt like any hope I had for my future was gone.”

The woman says she didn’t realize non-consensual photography was illegal until her best friend, who had a similar experience, told her about the city’s new law and encouraged her to go to the cops.



‘I thought I was going to kill myself. It felt like any hope I had for my future was gone.’

While police at Brooklyn’s 70th Precinct gave her the “runaround” at first, telling her to go to family court and forcing her to play the sex video for desk officers, a detective overheard her story when she came back a second time and said he’d take the case, the woman said.

“We strongly encourage all victims to come forward with any allegation of crime and strive to continually create a safe environment where we can help these victims feel comfortable telling their stories, ensuring that all complaints are fully investigated,’’ an NYPD spokeswoman told The Post.

That night, Salem was arrested and charged with raps including unlawful disclosure of the photos, aggravated harassment, coercion and stalking. He pleaded down to third-degree stalking and will be sentenced April 30.

While the woman is grateful that her case went to court, nearly a year later, she and her family are still suffering, she says.

“To this day, I still keep my ringtone off because the sound of my phone ringing reminds me of his obsessive phone calls at that time,’’ she said. “My little sister still hides when someone knocks on our front door.”

And the list goes on.

On March 4 last year, Kendel Gadsden, 23, called his victim 67 times in Brooklyn and warned, “If you don’t meet up with me, you will regret it,” according to a criminal complaint.

Three days later, he posted a picture of the victim’s “genitalia onto … Instagram, Twitter and Facebook,” court records say.

He was slapped with 29 charges including aggravated harassment and unlawful disclosure of an intimate image, pleaded guilty to first-degree criminal contempt and was sentenced to one to three years behind bars.

In August, Steven Sterling, 50, of the Bronx posted a video of him and his ex-girlfriend having sex on Tumblr and another photo that showed her breasts and face, court papers say.

“Karma takes too long, I want revenge,” Sterling told the woman, adding he was “trying to ruin” her “whole life,” the records state.

Sterling was charged for posting the images, and the case is pending. He declined comment to The Post.

In November, Shamsu Chowdhury, 56, continuously posted naked photos of his ex-girlfriend on Facebook for her family to see and told her, “I am going to keep posting these pictures for the rest of my life. I wont [sic] stop until you come back,” according to police and court records.

He was charged for threatening to post intimate images. His case is pending. He wouldn’t talk to The Post.

Zayquaun Stewart, 20, first sent a text to his victim and her parents in August saying he planned to kill her, according to a criminal complaint.

“You burying ur [sic] daughter next. Next time your daughter gonna know not to hurt people’s feelings,” Stewart wrote to the victim’s parents on Facebook, the records allege.

He then sent the family a picture of a gun and about two weeks later, posted a video of the pair having sex, according to the documents.

Stewart was charged with aggravated harassment and for unlawfully disclosing the images. He pleaded to harassment in the second degree, a violation, and was given a conditional discharge with a full order of protection for the victim.

Shawn Powers, who flipped off The Post during a recent court date, repeatedly posted images of his ex-girlfriend across social media and violated an order of protection she had against him. He was charged for disclosing the pictures, criminal contempt and related offenses and pleaded guilty to those charges.

If he completes substance-abuse and mental-health treatment and vocational or educational training and maintains full-time employment, he can re-plead in one year to just criminal contempt.

The good news is that more than 31 such non-consensual photography cases have reached dispositions in city courts through the beginning of January, victims and advocates say.



What’s difficult to accept is the conviction rate: Twenty-one cases were pleaded down to violations or adjourned in contemplation of dismissal, meaning the charge will be tossed if the defendant stays out of trouble.

Violations are not crimes and do not appear on criminal records.

Many defendants were given conditional discharges, and some were ordered to complete community service as punishment.

While Lancman acknowledges that the vast majority of the criminal cases result in pleas, he said convictions are important because of the deterrence factor.

“I’m confident if people start to see and understand that engaging in revenge porn will get you convicted of revenge porn, then we can de-normalize this conduct. … There’s more value than usual to require people to plead guilty to the actual offense,” Lancman said.

Meanwhile, in Albany, it’s Groundhog Day again for the Assembly’s Braunstein.

He is embarking on his sixth attempt to pass the related statewide bill he’s been pushing since 2013.

Six years ago, only New Jersey and California had laws against non-consensual photography. Since then, 38 states have passed similar bills.

On the final day of the legislative session last year, New York came the closest it ever has to passing the bill before it was squashed in the eleventh hour by Google lobbyists and the Internet Association, which reps Google and other Big Tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter.

The main qualm that Big Tech has with the state bill involves provisions that can hold websites liable for non-consensual photography posted to their platforms.

The city law specifically excludes websites from being held accountable.

John Olsen, a regional director for the Internet Association, said in a statement that IA’s members are against non-consensual photography but they should be allowed to police their own platforms and not be liable for non-consensual photography.

Braunstein said the opposing provision wouldn’t be necessary if these platforms were policed properly and it was easy for victims to get their images removed.

Carrie Goldberg, a Brooklyn-based lawyer who specializes in sexual-privacy violations, said Google has refused to remove rape videos depicting her clients because the tech giant claims they too closely resembled commercial porn. Google has not denied the assertion.

Braunstein said he expects his bill to go before both houses for a floor vote before April, but Goldberg is still wary.

“Maybe six time’s the charm,” she said. “I’m cautiously optimistic that we have a new set of lawmakers that aren’t going to crumble to pressure from what’s the most omniscient and omnipotent industry there is: the tech industry.”

According to a police report obtained by The Detroit News, police believe he may have burned down the home because there were no gay rights controversies to campaign against in Jackson.

In the months prior to the fire, Joly helped open Jackson's first gay community center and organized the city's first gay pride parade and festival.

People who worked with Joly told police that he was disappointed that the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival hadn't received more attention or protests.

A transgender activist in Michigan is accused by police of burning his own home and killing five pets, months after authorities investigated it as a hate crime.

According to a police report obtained by The Detroit News, police believe Nikki Joly, 54, may have burned down his house his Jackson, Michigan, because there were no gay rights controversies to campaign against.

Joly is a well-known LGBTQ activist, and in the months prior to the fire he helped open Jackson's first gay community center, organized the city's first gay pride festival, and helped lead the fight for an ordinance that prohibits discrimination against gay people.

The August 2017 fire killed Joly's two dogs and three cats and was investigated by the FBI as a hate crime.

According to the police report seen by The Detroit News, two church officials who worked with Joly at St. Johns United Church of Christ, where the Jackson Pride Center was located, told authorities that Joly was disappointed that the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival hadn't received more attention or protests.

Police say that the church officials, Barbara Shelton and Bobby James, described Joly as ""very deceptive"" and as having ""layers of manipulation.""

Joly married his girlfriend Chris Moore shortly before the fire destroyed his home. When they lost their home to the blaze, the Jackson community launched a fundraising effort that raised $58,000.

According to MLive, an FBI special agent who first investigated the fire as a potential hate crime later concluded Joly was the prime suspect.

The police report said that gasoline was found in five rooms of Joly's two-story, wooden-frame house, reported The Detroit News.

Police later learned Joly had bought $10 worth of gas at a Marathon station the day of the fire, and found traces of gasoline on his clothing.

Joly was charged with one felony count of first-degree arson in October 2018, according to Michigan Live, and was charged with two counts of animal killing the following December. His case is still ongoing."

The Detroit News reported Monday that law enforcement charged Joly, a transgender man from Jackson, Michigan, who burned down her own home, killing five pets inside, in what was initially investigated by the FBI as an alleged hate crime in 2017. The newspaper, citing two individuals who worked alongside Joly at St. Johns United Church of Christ, where the Jackson Pride Center is based, reported that Jolly, 54, had become “frustrated the controversy over gay rights had died down with the passage of the nondiscrimination law.”

The Detroit News reported:

The church officials, Barbara Shelton and Bobby James, when asked by police about a possible motive for the fire, said Joly was disappointed the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival, held five days before the blaze, hadn’t received more attention or protests. Contacted by a reporter, James declined to comment. But Shelton quibbled with the way police characterized her remarks, saying she had no idea if Joly was frustrated by the lack of controversy. “Not sure I said that,” she wrote in an email. “I have no idea about anything, never heard Nikki comment in any fashion about anything like that.”

Police officer Aaron Grove, who interviewed Shelton and James, said the pair described Joly as “‘very deceptive” and possessing “layers of manipulation.”

Joly, who was named MLive’s 2018 Citizen of the Year, spearheaded several LGBTQ-friendly initiatives and events, including the town’s first gay festival.

“It’s embarrassing,” said Travis Trombley, a gay resident of Jackson and former ally of Jolly. “How do you do it to the community you have put so much effort into helping?”

The paper reports that five pets — two German Shepherds and three cats — died in the fire. The body of one dog blocked a door as firefighters tried to enter.

The alleged hate hoax comes after Chicago prosecutors charged Empire actor Jussie Smollett for filing a false report with police in connection to staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself last month.

Smollett told police two masked individuals hurled bigoted insults and doused him with an unknown chemical substance while walking home from a sandwich shop at 2 a.m. on January 29. The actor also told police his assailants looped a thin rope around his neck and shouted “This is MAGA country!” before fleeing. He allegedly enlisted the help of two brothers — Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — to stage the attack, paying them $3,500 by check.

Smollett returned to the Chicago set of Empire after posting bond for $100,000 at a Cook County courthouse hours prior. However, Smollett’s role on the hit FOX studios program is uncertain as executive producers considering recasting his character."

Smollett has been charged with disorderly conduct and taken into custody last week before being released on bail. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson was highly critical of Smollett in a press conference on Thursday addressing the allegations against the 36-year-old actor, calling the alleged hoax a “publicity stunt” the “smeared” the city of Chicago.

Johnson spoke to GMA host Robin Roberts on Monday morning, insisting that authorities had plenty of evidence against Smollett following reports over the weekend raising questions about check the actor wrote to the two brothers believed to be involved in the attack. Authorities reportedly believe the check was payment for the brothers’ help in staging the purported hate crime, though Smollett reportedly wrote a memo on the check indicating it was for training in preparation for an upcoming music video. Text messages between Smollett and one of the brothers also indicated that they were working together on a nutrition and fitness program.

On GMA, Johnson said he still believes the check was for help staging a hate crime.

“They [the brothers] said that he paid them $3,500 with a check … to carry out this incident,” Johnson said on the morning talk show, according to the New York Post. Johnson also said the check is only part of the evidence police have that has led them to believe Smollett was not telling the truth when he claimed to have been targeted in a racist and homophobic hate crime in the early morning hours of January 29.

“Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, that does not support the version he gave,” Johnson said on the show.

“There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply doesn’t support his version of what happened.”

“It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something, it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this,” Johnson reportedly said.

Smollett was charged with disorderly conduct last week and released on $100,000 bail. He is reportedly due back in court on March 14."

Appearing on the program to speak about a column he wrote for The Atlantic, Columbia University Professor John McWhorter explained the motivations behind Jussie Smollett’s hate crime hoax.

McWhorter makes the case that Smollett took cues from the lessons learned from the Covington incident. Primarily, Smollett realized that America is quick to side with alleged victims, even with the facts don’t support the narrative. Moreover, Smollett realized the virtue of being a victim in the social justice age.

He didn’t get this out of nowhere. This is a young man who figured out that he can be more interesting as someone who was jumped by MAGA-shouting white guys than he as the very deft star of a very interesting TV show. So what this means is that in a way all of us are culpable in that if we are part of this us, we look at this Covington kid and we look at one millisecond of his smile and we decide that he symbolizes the racism of all of America, when really it was just a millisecond of that kid walking by somebody and not smiling with his teeth showing. And intelligent people think of themselves of being ahead of the curve in seeing that as a summation of American history.

McWhorter went on to make the case that Smollett wanted to exploit our cultural moment’s insistence on punishing conservatives for their political beliefs. According to McWhorter, Smollett believed rightfully that many on the American left would rush to his defense, even if the attack was entirely fabricated.

He knows that here in America, not only do we know that racism and homophobia exist, and we should, but he knows that we have gotten to the point that we are so bent on demonizing people like that Covington kid, demonizing somebody who voted for Donald Trump because they didn’t prioritize racism as much as some of us do, that he actually thought it would be a good idea to create something like this and become more famous than he was.

Jada Pinkett Smith is once again getting brutally honest when it comes to her marriage with Will Smith.

On Monday’s brand new episode of the actress’ Facebook Watch series, “Red Table Talk”, her guests are Jane the Virgin star Justin Baldoni and rapper Wale. The two men candidly discuss love and relationships, and Pinkett Smith says her view of love has definitely changed after being married to Smith for 21 years.

“Let me tell you, nobody talks about the sacrifice, the deteriorating and dissolving of fantasies,” she says bluntly, addressing Wale, who’s currently single and actively looking for a long-term relationship. “You right now, have in your mind, your perfect woman. And when you find that woman, she will be a goddess to you. We fall in love with the goddess, or the god, within that person, and then when we actually meet the human being, then we gotta learn how to love that one. The reason why it is so important to me to be able to stick it out, to really get to the true meaning of love, in my opinion, it is unconditional. It has to be, because we are all too flawed. No matter how much work we do! It never ends.”

The actress admits part of her problems with Smith stemmed from her coming into their relationship with a lot of personal issues, and that her expectations of him were too high.

“I grew up in a single parent home, I didn’t see all the time healthy relationships,” she explains. “I had to figure it out too. I came to the table with a lot of pain and a lot of brokenness. And most of all, I came to the table with some hardcore daddy issues. It made me really angry towards men. I had very high expectations. I was hard. I could’ve ended up with all kinds of dudes. The way I ended up with Will, I had to change my whole perspective, because I want you to know something, he was not the dude! But I had to change that. I can’t ask somebody to be for me, what I am not willing to be for them. And what I realized in my partnership with Will, was I was asking him to be a lot of things for me that I wasn’t willing to do for me.”

Pinkett Smith acknowledges there have been moments when both she and Will wanted to walk away from the marriage.

“There have been several occasions where you just had enough and you want to leave and I just couldn’t. Or Will just couldn’t,” she admits. “Because we knew this was what was meant to be — this partnership. No matter what the form is. We had to redefine it. We don’t call ourselves married anymore. We’re in a life partnership.”

Still, she stresses that all the hard work the couple has put into their marriage has definitely been worth it.

“At the end of the day, to know that you have another person that can love you for all that you are … Will has loved me through the worst of myself,” she shares. “And I have done the same. When somebody can love you in that way, it makes your faith in the world come together. … I am 47 years old and I want you to know, that this is probably the first year of my life that I can say, ‘I am happy,’ because that’s how long the journey has been.”

ET spoke to Pinkett Smith earlier this month when she revealed who we won’t be seeing on “Red Table Talk” anytime soon. Watch the video below:

According to a police report obtained by The Detroit News, police believe he may have burned down the home because there were no gay rights controversies to campaign against in Jackson.

In the months prior to the fire, Joly helped open Jackson’s first gay community center and organised the city’s first gay pride parade and festival.

People who worked with Joly told police that he was disappointed that the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival hadn’t received more attention or protests.

A transgender activist in Michigan is accused by police of burning his own home and killing five pets, months after authorities investigated it as a hate crime.

According to a police report obtained by The Detroit News, police believe Nikki Joly, 54, may have burned down his house his Jackson, Michigan, because there were no gay rights controversies to campaign against.

Joly is a well-known LGBTQ activist, and in the months prior to the fire he helped open Jackson’s first gay community center, organised the city’s first gay pride festival, and helped lead the fight for an ordinance that prohibits discrimination against gay people.

The August 2017 fire killed Joly’s two dogs and three cats and was investigated by the FBI as a hate crime.

According to the police report seen by The Detroit News, two church officials who worked with Joly at St. Johns United Church of Christ, where the Jackson Pride Center was located, told authorities that Joly was disappointed that the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival hadn’t received more attention or protests.

Police say that the church officials, Barbara Shelton and Bobby James, described Joly as “very deceptive” and as having “layers of manipulation.”

Joly married his girlfriend Chris Moore shortly before the fire destroyed his home. When they lost their home to the blaze, the Jackson community launched a fundraising effort that raised $US58,000.

According to MLive, an FBI special agent who first investigated the fire as a potential hate crime later concluded Joly was the prime suspect.

The police report said that gasoline was found in five rooms of Joly’s two-story, wooden-frame house, reported The Detroit News.

Police later learned Joly had bought $US10 worth of gas at a Marathon station the day of the fire, and found traces of gasoline on his clothing.

Joly was charged with one felony count of first-degree arson in October 2018, according to Michigan Live, and was charged with two counts of animal killing the following December. His case is still ongoing.

43,https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/how-easy-is-it-to-report-a-crime-that-never-happened/,,How Easy Is It To Report A Crime That Never Happened?,"['Toni Messina', 'Thomson Reuters', 'Above The Law', 'Wolters Kluwer', 'Lex Machina']",https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2019/02/Jussie-Smollett.jpg,"['happened', 'easy', 'arrest', 'wearing', 'case', 'person', 'report', '911', 'reporting', 'complainant', 'crimes', 'crime', 'arrested']","Jussie Smollett was charged last week with falsely reporting a crime to police, subjecting him to both jail and a fine if convicted. The case made me wonder: how common is it for people to call 911 and report crimes that never happened?

Turns out there’s little data on the subject, but lots of reasons people might be tempted to do it.

You see, it’s relatively easy to get people arrested. When a person dials 911, unless the allegation is so obviously false, police must investigate. In many states, even in medical situations, when 911 is called, police show up to make sure the medical situation is not the result of foul play.

Once on the scene, if police meet a complainant who seems reasonable and who recites the details of a crime, describing the person involved, all they need is the barest corroboration to arrest the person. For example, a person might have feuded with his or her partner. They then call 911 and claim they were pushed against a wall and suffered a concussion. No signs of injury, no corroboration. Police can and probably will arrest the person the complainant accused just because the complaint was made. That person will then be fingerprinted and his mug shot taken. He’ll then be placed in a cell while a prosecutor decides whether there’s enough information to bring the case to court.

Without direct evidence of innocence — such as an alibi, a video depicting something different than what the complainant said — or a complainant with his own criminal history, the case will likely go forward. The theory is that it’s better to err on the side of caution and arrest the suspect, than fail to arrest someone who goes on to do something worse.

Even an anonymous complainant can get someone arrested. A person can call 911 and claim to have seen a purse snatch. He describes a light-skinned Hispanic male wearing a grey hoodie and Nikes running down the street. Even without speaking further to the 911 caller, police then have probable cause to detain any Hispanic male in that vicinity wearing a grey hoodie and sneakers. Whether they hold him for long depends on what they find on him that corroborates the crime. But in the first instance, he’ll be stopped, brought to a precinct, and searched. If he’s carrying anything illegal, say cocaine, he can be arrested for that even though it had nothing to do with the alleged crime for which he was stopped.

Motivations for making up crimes are many. Someone in the midst of a divorce may try to make the ex-partner look bad. (Child abuse is generally the crime du jour here.) A man tired of his neighbor’s dog might say the neighbor threatened him with a gun. A high school student unprepared for an exam could call in a bomb threat, or a person feeling powerless could call 911 making up an emergency just for the rush of bringing police to the scene en masse.

False reporting, though, is dangerous. It takes police away from crimes that really do need addressing. They can ruin the falsely accused person’s reputation, cause him to lose his job, and cost time and money for a lawyer. That’s why false accusations are crimes in and of themselves.

Smollett’s alleged made-up crime is an odd one. The “hate crime” read a little too pat — noose around his neck, shouts of the N-word from guys wearing “MAGA” hats. Plus, asking two Nigerian brothers (both black) to stage it, made no sense. Why didn’t he ask two white guys to pull it off if he intended for it to be corroborated by video, as reports say?

What was his motive? Allegedly the “Empire” actor was looking for higher pay. Well, he didn’t get that, but he did get his name in the spotlight, although not in the way he was hoping.

Hate crimes are reportedly on the rise in Trump’s America and reporting crimes that may never have happened makes it that much easier for people with real claims not to be believed. This may be the worst danger of all.

Did the Chicago police overstate their case against Jussie Smollett? The department says no.

Over the weekend, digital scans of the alleged check for $3,500 to brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo that is being used by Chicago police to accuse Smollett of staging his own hate crime have emerged and complicate claims made by Chicago’s top cop.

The memo line on the check dated January 23 states that the payment is for “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go).” The phrase “Don’t Go” refers to an upcoming music video that Smollett was preparing to shoot, according to ABC News.

Sources close to Smollett told various outlets that the $3,500 amounts to a five week fitness program that is $600 per week, and $100 a week for nutrition plan.

Text messages reviewed and published by TMZ — a source that has been continuously one of the first outlets to publish new evidence in this case — corroborated the intent of the check by showing Smollett discussing the diet plans with the two brothers, who are named as key witnesses.

Messages on January 28 allegedly focus on Smollett’s diet while traveling, which is the day before the reported incident.

Chicago police accused Smollett in a press conference last week of staging the entire incident due to salary issues on his television show, Empire, and misleading their department. Police superintendent Eddie Johnson focused in on the $3,500 check as primary evidence to Smollett filing a false report and staging his own hate crime.

On Monday, Johnson took to Good Morning America and defended the department’s case. He told Robin Roberts that the brothers told police during interrogations that this specific check was given to them for the attack.

""I was very acutely aware of the situation in terms of the Chicago Police Department declaring he was a suspect. But I can tell you this, Robin, there's a lot more evidence that hasn't been presented yet that does not support the version that he gave us,"" Johnson told Good Morning America. ""There's still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence, and testimony that just simply doesn't support his version of what happened.""

The official didn’t expand on what that evidence is, and when the department was asked in follow-up questions by The Advocate if the brothers have told police that the personal training was being used as a cover-up for plotting the incident, the department refused to elaborate.

“Any comments at this point must come from prosecutors however we stand firmly behind this investigation that is predicated exclusively on sworn testimony and video recorded interviews that are supported by physical evidence, including text messages and official records,” spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told The Advocate. “Like any and all defendants, Mr. Smollett has the presumption of innocence and this matter will be decided by a criminal court.”

Smollett’s camp was not able to provide comment on whether the actor intentionally misrepresented the check in order to hide payments related to staging the incident. But after last week’s press conference, lawyers representing the actor maintained their defense by lashing out at the Chicago police who they say have created a “spectacle.”

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said after the press conference. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” they continued.

As the actor awaits his next court date on March 14, all projects of his planned for release have been paused and the actor has been written out of Empire’s final episodes. But even while the actor’s presence on the show is now reduced, some fellow celebrities have not completely distanced themselves from the actor.

On Sunday, Terrence Howard, who plays Smollett’s father on the show, responded to the investigation on social media by showing support.

In a video on Instagram that shows Smollett holding a baby, Howard writes: “All your lil homies got you. We love the hell outta you.”"

This comes just a couple of weeks after Roberts interviewed Smollett about the alleged attack.

However, just a few days later, Smollett was charged with federal disorderly conduct for falsifying a police report. He was also accused of paying brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo $3,500 to attack him.

""It's important for people to recognize that it's not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something, it's the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this,” Johnson continued.

Smollett was also written out of the final two episodes of the season on Empire, despite showing up to set on Thursday, February 21.

According to TMZ, Smollett’s co-star Terrence Howard was very upset throughout the whole day. A source said Howard “grilled” Smollett about his story and was not present when he apologized to the cast and crew.

However, despite Howard’s alleged frustrations, he did post a video of support for Smollett on Saturday, February 23. ""All your lil homies got you. We love the hell outta you,"" he captioned the video of Smollett holding Howard’s son.

Howard also defended Smollett in the comments section after a fan criticized his support, writing, ""Sorry you feel that way but that's the only Jussie I know. The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly.

“His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I've called my son for five years. It's God's job to judge and it's ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved."""

CHICAGO -- A Chicago judge says ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett can travel out-of-state to meet his lawyers while he's free on bond on charges he falsely reported being attacked by two masked men.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's attorneys, who say he's innocent.

Kavanagh says attorney Mark Geragos, who's based in Los Angeles, is Smollett's lead attorney. She says a defense lawyer asked Monday that Smollett be allowed to travel to California and New York for meetings with his legal team.

Smollett was charged last week with disorderly conduct. Chicago police say Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the attack then told police his attackers yelled racial and anti-gay slurs and referenced President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

He was released last week after posting $10,000 cash. He was ordered to surrender his passport."

The AP details key moments in the story. (Feb. 20)

When Nikki Joly's Jackson home burned down in 2017, some believed the fire was a hate crime against the transgender, gay-rights activist who had fought for a local anti-discrimination ordinance.

But now, instead of a victim, the 54-year-old is accused of being the perpetrator.

The Michigan case is gaining national attention as the American public draws parallels to the situation involving Jussie Smollett, where the supposed victim in a hate crime became the accused. Authorities concluded the attack on Smollett was a hoax.

“Real hate crimes are on the rise,” Graham Cassano, associate professor of sociology at Oakland University, said Monday. “But as these crimes increase and become publicized, it’s not surprising to me that people would take the opportunity to use this to their advantage and fabricate hate crimes.”

Authorities are accusing Joly, who was named Citizen of the Year by the Jackson Citizen Patriot last year, of setting fire to his own home and killing his pets, two dogs and three cats. He has been charged with first-degree arson.

A hearing has been set for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court.

""We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,"" Elmer Hitt, Jackson’s director of police and fire services, said Monday. ""We investigated it over what probably was a year’s time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.”

Unexpected twists

Hitt said that, initially, some in the community perceived the blaze to be a hate crime. Investigators considered that too, but ruled out the possibility as evidence pointing to Joly came to light.

Hitt declined to offer a motive for the house fire, but acknowledged that some people in Jackson were probably rattled — perhaps in a similar way to the Smollett case — by the police investigation's unexpected outcome and charge.

In the higher-profile hate crime case that turned on its head last week, Smollett, a 36-year-old actor on the TV drama ""Empire,"" alleged to Chicago police he had been a victim.

Smollett was arrested on charges that he set up the assault.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said that masked men yelled racial slurs, attacked him, put a rope around his neck and made references to MAGA, the acronym for President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

But, Chicago police said, their investigation found evidence that Smollett staged the crime, possibly to portray himself as a victim and boost his salary as an actor, and lied to police.

Citizen of the Year

Joly, a transgender man, was touted as Jackon's 2018 citizen of the year by the local newspaper and described as an activist who had endured slights and still re-energized a movement.

He tried to ""pass an ordinance in Jackson protecting people against discrimination because they are gay, because they are transgender, because they aren't as some say they should be.""

The newspaper's long profile described the Detroit native as someone who had been on his own since his adoptive parents ousted him at 15, had been sexually assaulted, and subjected to ""insulting gender questions"" and ""refused service in bars or restaurants.""

Joly, the article said, was ""born female,"" but ""prefers a masculine pronoun"" and has long ""been activist-minded even if it was not always openly.""

It also mentioned the fire on Aug. 10, 2017, in which his home was burned down.

In the profile, Joly said that he was ""really in shock for quite a while"" after the fire. He teared at the thought of his dogs, who perished in the blaze, and organized a weapons training course at a gun range to fight fear.

A few months later, Joly was charged with setting the fire.

Fake hate crimes

In the Joly case, police suspicion was based on a timeline of events, phone records, physical evidence and witness statements. Joly had the ""means and opportunity to start the fire,"" according to a report published by MLive.com in October.

The MLive article said security camera video showed Joly filling a gas can before the fire, gasoline was on his clothing, a witness smelled gas on him, photographs seemed to be missing from the walls, and after the fire, Joly received $50,000 in donations.

Joly's attorney, Andrew Abood, challenged the police conclusion.

""What they have is a coincidence and a coincidence is not proof beyond reasonable doubt,"" MLive quoted Abood saying. ""They are trying to convict on circumstantial evidence and theory when they have no direct evidence in the case.""

Still, Cassano said that when presumed victims of hate crimes are actually the perpetrators, ""it's terrible for social movements in general"" and terrible, specifically, for people ""facing real hate crimes.""

In 2018 alone, the civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Campaign, tracked 26 deaths of transgender people in the U.S. as a result of violence. So far this year, the group identified one death.

The most recent stats from the FBI showed 7,106 hate crimes in 2017, up 17 percent from the year before. Of those crimes, nearly 60 percent of the victims were targeted because of race and ethnicity and nearly 16 percent because of sexual orientation.

""When someone comes along and fabricates a hate crime it calls into question people who have really experienced these things,"" Cassano said. ""It's absolutely awful. It really, to my mind, is incomprehensible.""

Wilfred Reilly, an associate professor of political science at Kentucky State University in Frankfort who has studied fake hate crimes, wrote that the fact that Smollett’s case is being alleged a hoax ""shouldn’t surprise anyone.""

Reilly didn't mention the Joly case but made the case in an opinion piece for USA TODAY and a book ""Hate Crime Hoax: How the Left is Selling a Fake Race War"" that ""a great many hate crime stories turn out to be hoaxes.""

The professor said he found more than 400 confirmed hate hoaxes, and he concluded that ""what hate hoaxers actually do is worsen generally good race relations, and distract attention from real problems.""

According to a police report obtained by The Detroit News, police believe he may have burned down the home because there were no gay rights controversies to campaign against in Jackson.

In the months prior to the fire, Joly helped open Jackson's first gay community center and organized the city's first gay pride parade and festival.

People who worked with Joly told police that he was disappointed that the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival hadn't received more attention or protests.

A transgender activist in Michigan is accused by police of burning his own home and killing five pets, months after authorities investigated it as a hate crime.

According to a police report obtained by The Detroit News, police believe Nikki Joly, 54, may have burned down his house his Jackson, Michigan, because there were no gay rights controversies to campaign against.

Joly is a well-known LGBTQ activist, and in the months prior to the fire he helped open Jackson's first gay community center, organized the city's first gay pride festival, and helped lead the fight for an ordinance that prohibits discrimination against gay people.

The August 2017 fire killed Joly's two dogs and three cats and was investigated by the FBI as a hate crime.

According to the police report seen by The Detroit News, two church officials who worked with Joly at St. Johns United Church of Christ, where the Jackson Pride Center was located, told authorities that Joly was disappointed that the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival hadn't received more attention or protests.

Police say that the church officials, Barbara Shelton and Bobby James, described Joly as ""very deceptive"" and as having ""layers of manipulation.""

Joly married his girlfriend Chris Moore shortly before the fire destroyed his home. When they lost their home to the blaze, the Jackson community launched a fundraising effort that raised $58,000.

According to MLive, an FBI special agent who first investigated the fire as a potential hate crime later concluded Joly was the prime suspect.

The police report said that gasoline was found in five rooms of Joly's two-story, wooden-frame house, reported The Detroit News.

Police later learned Joly had bought $10 worth of gas at a Marathon station the day of the fire, and found traces of gasoline on his clothing.

Joly was charged with one felony count of first-degree arson in October 2018, according to Michigan Live, and was charged with two counts of animal killing the following December. His case is still ongoing."

Now police have charged Joly with arson, stunning supporters.

Joly has been instrumental in LGBTQ visibility and action in the largely conservative town of Jackson, Michigan, facing down threats as he worked to organize the city’s first pride festival and pushing for an LGBTQ-inclusive anti-discrimination ordinance in Jackson.

He has also served as director of the Jackson Pride Center that he helped establish.

The local paper, the Jackson News had named Joly as their Citizen of the Year in 2017 due to all of his work on behalf of the LGBTQ community, but his visibility also made him the target of a lot of anger and hate from those opposed to LGBTQ rights.

When Joly’s home burned down in August of 2017, killing two German shepherds and three cats trapped inside and destroying the contents of the home. Gasoline had been splashed around the interior.

Supporters of Joly had raised $58,000 to help him and his wife, Chris Moore, get back on their feet.

Many assumed that the blaze may have been a reaction from local bigots.

Police initially suspected Robert Tulloch, a local man who had objected to the city approving the display of a rainbow flag a local park during the pride festival. Tulloch had written to the city manager and city council in opposition, telling them that allowing the flag to be flown, “is an in your face declaration of war and will be met with a violent response.”

Tulloch, however, was making a deposit at a local bank at the time of the fire.

Police turned their attention from Tulloch to the one person who had been at the house right around the time of the fire: Joly.

The morning of the fire, Joly had purchased $10 of gasoline from a local station. Joly said it was to power the lawnmower, but that it was too warm out to complete the job.

Joly left the house, but returned a few minutes later to retrieve his wife’s lunch. The fire was reported minutes after he left.

Police also found traces of gasoline on the clothing Joly was wearing the day of the fire.

The only thing that remains unclear is a motive. The house was insured, but it is not owned by Joly.

Joly was, however, in the process of buying the home from its owner through a land contract, putting $621.54 monthly towards a total $57,000 fee. Joly has previous ran behind on these fees, getting caught up via aid from St. John’s Church.

Police also speculate that Joly did it to build more attention to him and his battles for LGBTQ rights in the city, but supporters note that Joly was already well known and respected in Jackson.

Joly is charged with one felony count of first-degree arson, which is punishable by up to life in prison and/or a sizable cash fine."

LOS ANGELES - The Oscars celebrated diversity with a string of wins for minority nominees, but the night's message was undermined by a bitter controversy simmering Monday over the best picture winner, civil rights dramedy ""Green Book.""

Producers accept the best picture Oscar for ""Green Book,"" which has taken more than $140 million in box offices worldwide, but sparked controversy

The victory for Peter Farrelly's true-life story of a gay black pianist who strikes up an unlikely friendship with his Italian-American driver in 1960s America lit up social media, sparking a savage backlash over what critics see as its ""whitesplaining"" racial politics.

Veteran African American filmmaker Spike Lee stormed briefly out of the auditorium as the top prize at the 91st Academy Awards was announced on Sunday, later hinting that he thought it was a historically poor choice.

Lee was dumbfounded back in 1990 when ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" a movie deemed by many to be egregiously tone deaf on race, won best picture while his widely lauded ""Do the Right Thing"" couldn't even muster a nomination.

Three decades later, Lee was in the running for best film with ""BlacKkKlansman"" and appeared exasperated to lose to another film about race relations set largely in a car.

""I'm snakebit -- every time someone's driving someone, I lose,"" Lee half-joked backstage, visibly frustrated despite taking home a consolation prize -- an Oscar for screenwriting, his first in a competitive category.

An evening overshadowed by a controversy over race had a fitting coda when Lee -- after pleading for US voters to ""be on the right side of history"" when they vote in the 2020 presidential election -- took a Twitter beating from Donald Trump.

""Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President,"" Trump tweeted Monday, although he hadn't been named by the director.

- 'Repellently obtuse' -

The top prize -- the third statuette of the night for ""Green Book"" -- came after its star Mahershala Ali, an African American and two years ago the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar, bagged the prize for best supporting actor.

The film, an audience favorite that has taken more than $140 million in box offices worldwide, it has been embroiled in controversy since its premiere.

The real-life family of Ali's character, the late pianist Don Shirley, denounced the film as a ""symphony of lies"" while others described it as yet another ""white savior movie.""

Ali's co-star Viggo Mortensen was hardly a balm to the roiling controversy when, during a Q&A on the film in November, he used the N-word.

On the surface, the academy's selections on Sunday looked about as diverse as could be expected, with superhero blockbuster ""Black Panther,"" a movie with a mainly black cast, scooping three awards.

Three of the four acting prizes went to African Americans and an Egyptian first-generation American, while black women won in costume design and production design for the first time, both for ""Black Panther.""

Richard Brody argued in The New Yorker, however, that the ""repellently obtuse"" ""Green Book"" proved the academy had changed nothing meaningful since being berated over the 2016-17 #OscarsSoWhite controversy.

- 'Woke liberals' -

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found that the ""well-intentioned white/black balance"" came across as glib, while the London-based Independent website bemoaned its ""relentless, almost uncanny mediocrity.""

As is often the case, there was a backlash to the backlash, from commentators complaining of an industry crippled by its fear of offending audiences and an obsession with the appearance of political correctness rather than genuine reform.

""No matter how woke you go it's never. good. enough,"" tweeted Claire Lehmann, the founding editor of online magazine Quillette.

Conservative entertainment blog Hollywood in Toto, which considers Tinseltown's liberals as something of a bete noire, described the bonding theme in ""Green Book"" as ""noble.""

""Saying movies like 'Green Book' make white movie goers feel better is insulting,"" said editor Christian Toto. ""Why would you need to be white to enjoy a beautifully told story about moving past one's bigotry?""

Toto evoked the allegedly faked recent hate attack on black ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett to argue that the US movie industry is often too quick to see racism where none exists.

The annual UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report, published last week, noted that the ever-broadening landscape created by Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and other streaming services had ""created a tailwind"" for racial diversity.

The number of minority actors with lead roles in films increased from 13.9 percent in 2016 to 19.8 percent in 2017 -- a far from perfect statistic but a sizeable improvement, nonetheless.

""It sounds absurd to suggest people who claim to be against racism, like woke liberals in and out of Hollywood, would be against a film that promotes racial healing,"" said Toto."

He claimed his attackers (the brothers) were wearing ""Make America Great Again"" hats and that they poured an unknown substance on his body before putting a noose around his neck. According to police, Smollett paid the brothers with a check and they were caught on camera purchasing the hats, rope and bleach prior to incident.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Jussie Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

“There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet and does not support the version he gave,” Johnson said during an interview with Good Morning America Monday. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence, and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

Whether or not Jussie Smollett orchestrated the attack he says happened on Jan. 29, he “still has the presumption of innocence until he has his day in court,” said Chicago Police Department superintendent Eddie Johnson in a televised interview.

Speaking to Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts in a segment that aired Monday morning, Johnson said that the Empire star should be presumed innocent of all wrongdoing until proven otherwise. He also reminded viewers that racist and homophobic attacks like the one Smollett says he experienced happen all the time — they just don’t receive nearly as much news coverage, if any, when they happen to people who aren’t famous.

“[Whatever the outcome of the Smollett investigation,] I just hope people don’t judge other folks that are victims of these type of crimes,” said Johnson.

Smollett previously appeared on Good Morning America nearly two weeks ago. Speaking to Roberts, he stood by his version of events.

Gay Black men like Smollett are among “some of the most vulnerable to violence in the LGBTQ+ community,” the New York City Anti-Violence Project said in a statement following news of the actor’s alleged attack. And as Out staff writer Mathew Rodriguez wrote last month, hate crimes — i.e., criminal offenses motivated by bias against a group of people — are on the rise nationally.

“There are real victims of crimes of that nature — hate crimes — and I just hope that people don’t treat them with skepticism,” Johnson told Roberts on Good Morning America. “[The Smollett case] is one particular incident, and it has to stand on its own merits.”

He has a point — save your skepticism for the Chicago Police Department, which didn’t move half this quickly in its investigation of Jason Van Dyke, the police officer who, in 2018, was convicted of murdering LaQuan McDonald four years prior, despite having dash-cam footage of the incident the entire time!

Kavanagh says attorney Mark Geragos, who’s based in Los Angeles, is Smollett’s lead attorney. She says a defense lawyer asked Monday that Smollett be allowed to travel to California and New York for meetings with his legal team.

Chicago police charged Smollett with disorderly conduct. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett, who is black and gay, staged a racist and homophobic attack , then told police his attackers yelled racial and anti-gay slurs and referenced President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

He was released last week after posting $10,000 cash. He was ordered to surrender his passport.

Chicago’s top policeman has told Good Morning America further “physical and video evidence” is yet to emerge in the investigation against Jussie Smollett, the actor accused of staging a hate attack against himself. Police Superintendence Eddie Johnson told Good Morning America's Robin Roberts: “Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, that does not support the version he gave.

But he added Mr Smollett “still has the presumption of innocence until he has his day in court”. Mr Johnson added: “I just want people to understand, that’s a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department. “It’s important for people to recognise that it’s not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something, it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this."" Mr Smollett claimed in January he was beaten and had a noose placed around his neck in a targeted attack by two white attackers.

According to the actor, he was covered in a chemical substance while subjected to homophobic and racist abuse. But investigating police later accused the openly gay actor of organising the attack as he was upset with his salary. Mr Smollett was charged with disorderly conduct filing a false police report after he turned himself in and was arrested. Lawyers for Mr Smollett say the presumption of innocence was trampled upon at the expense of the actor.

On Friday, Fox announced that Jussie Smollett would not appear in either of the final two episodes of Empire, which is completing its 5th season.

This comes one day after police arrested the actor for allegedly staging an assault against himself and claiming that he was the victim of a hate crime.

After an initial court hearing, in which Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. called the alleged crime despicable, the Chicago police released Smollett on a $100,000 bond. He then returned to the set of Empire to resume filming.

But the producers of the show then issued a statement which said that, while they are waiting for the legal process to complete itself, for the sake of the show and everyone on it, they will avoid any further disruption by removing Smollett’s character from the remaining episodes.

Smollett did not appear on set for Friday’s filming.

In the following days, Chicago Police revealed that more evidence exists against Smollett. “There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told Good Morning America.

“There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

The producers of Empire still have time to decide what to do about Smollett going forward.

If they decide to renew the series, which is not a sure thing, they must do so by mid-May. If they do, they then have until the end of June to decide whether to pick up Smollett’s contract.

Complicating matters further is the fact that The Walt Disney Company will soon take control of 20th Century Fox Television, which produces Empire. So, the decision will be up to them, and they may not want their reputation for family-friendly programming tainted by scandal.

Jussie Smollett plays Jamal Lyon on the show, who is the gay son of a hip-hop mogul. Just a week ago, Danny Strong — who is one of the producers of the show — called Smollett the third lead actor, after Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson.

Empire is set to return on Fox on March 13th, though it’s unclear if Smollett will appear in the 7 episodes that have already been filmed."

Many versions of the same theme were on display last week. Let’s take a look at a few.

Four years ago, a 20-year-old woman left Alabama for Syria and joined ISIS. Until recently when the caliphate was decimated, she was an active participant in ISIS propaganda activities. She was married three times to ISIS fighters and has an 18-month-old son. In January, she escaped from ISIS and surrendered to Kurdish troops and is now in a refugee camp. Because she was born in the U.S., she is claiming to be a U.S. citizen and wants to return to this country. Citing a technicality based on the belief that her foreign-diplomat father was still employed in that capacity at the time of her birth, the State Department is denying she is a citizen and refuses to allow her back in. A lawsuit to settle matters has been filed.

The woman acknowledges her ISIS activities and understands that if she returned, she would be arrested and tried for terrorism. She says she hopes the U.S. would accept her explanation that she was young and made a very bad mistake in joining ISIS, show leniency, and perhaps give her counseling, but also realizes she could spend the rest of her life in prison. She says she knows she has ruined her life and accepts the consequences, but wants to provide an opportunity for her son in the U.S.

The legal issue seems to revolve around whether documentation revealing that her father was no longer employed as a diplomat at the time of her birth was filed appropriately. It seems likely to demonstrate that he was not a diplomat then, and so according to the 14th Amendment (the debate on the wisdom of that is for another day), she is a citizen and has the right to reenter the country. One could also debate the wisdom of not being able to strip citizenship from someone who chooses to be an enemy combatant, particularly given the atrocities committed by ISIS while she was involved in propaganda for them. But that’s what the law says.

For a variety of reasons, I think the Trump administration is wrong on this one. I get it — officials really don’t want a potential show trial that might require use of classified info, and with the border debate raging, it’s understandable that Team Trump would rather not have an image of a young child being taken away from his mother. But this is an opportunity it should embrace. Defeating ISIS militarily was never the biggest challenge. All that took was the will to do it. But ISIS remains a challenging ideology that continues to breed terrorism, and this situation provides an opportunity to further discredit ISIS as losers.

I would opt for trying to cut a deal with the woman. To be sure, have her plead guilty, give her a very stiff minimum sentence (25-30 years?), and require her to provide any intel she might have on ISIS. I would also care for her child and give her the chance to mitigate her sentence over time if she would become the poster child for anti-ISIS propaganda and counsel potential ISIS/radical Muslim recruits. Take what appears to be yes for an answer and enlist an asset in the tougher propaganda phase of the war on terror. The State Deparmtent seems likely to lose the citizenship case as it stands, but the abetting terror evidence against her seems overwhelming, so the stick would be life without parole. Looks like a good trade.

The Jussie Smollett case has been in the headlines somewhat longer than the usual news cycle permits, but that will fade. Before the incident, dozens of Americans knew who this guy was, and I was not one of them. And he will return to quasi anonymous status shortly regardless of whether or not he is prosecuted. There are so many sub plots to this story, but one of the most prominent yet least publicized is the utter lack of accountability on the part of the media, celebrities, and Democrat presidential candidates who jumped on the story immediately to promote an agenda.

From the media, the most we are hearing after the facts came out is the claim that they were skeptical all along and merely reported what Smollett said without opining. But noticeably absent from the initial reporting were words like “alleged.” Contrast that with the reporting of the attack at Berkeley on the guy from Turning Point in which the victim was described as a “conservative activist.” And despite the existence of a video of the actual attack, the word “alleged” was everywhere.

Furthermore, does anyone believe that the Smollett story would have gotten legs if the “MAGA country” comment were not there? A gay black man being roughed up and subjected to slurs in subzero wind chills in Chicago might have had a one-day run on page B27 of the local papers, but the only reason it went national was the piece of the play that had Trump supporters in a starring role. If you want more evidence of this, consider the media phrasing after the scam became public. Somehow, references to MAGA comments, which might now put Trump supporters in a sympathetic light, disappeared from the reporting.

I really don’t care about Smollett’s motives. Speculation has centered around greed, as if victimhood status from a Trump mob would translate into greater career earnings. Even the Chicago cops cited better salary as the prime mover. But maybe it was sheer Trump hatred and a belief that he would maintain more than the requisite 15 minutes of fame and attention from the anti-Trump angle. Colin Kaepernick got both, so why not?

Or perhaps the guy simply has a few screws loose. After all, what genius plans a 2 AM attack that requires the attackers to actually lie in wait and know he would be out for a burger in minus-20 wind-chill conditions and then leaves a paper trail of cell-phone contacts and pays the actors in the drama by check?

The Democrat candidates fell all over each other to scream victimhood and blast Trump as the cause of all racial and sexual identity bias, with the grand total of zero caveats. But when the scam came out, they all claimed to need to wait for all the facts to come in, wiped all prior references away, and hoped the 24-hour news cycle would save them. Ditto for the celebrities who piled on in similar fashion and are now claiming that even though this story may have been made up, real bias exists, so it’s OK to do whatever it takes to draw attention to it.

The Chicago press is calling for an apology to the city, and people are lamenting the potential loss of credibility regarding future victims of hate crimes. But nobody seems ready to say they are sorry to the only group who was truly and immediately slimed — Trump supporters. You might greet the celebrity reaction with an eye roll, but the Democrat candidates, last time I checked, are in the running to be the president of the United State. One might hope for a higher bar. The entire incident says more about them and the media than anything else.

It’s not clear what will happen to Smollett. He is maintaining his innocence, claiming untreated substance abuse or some such, and his lawyers are blaming the Chicago cops for “rushing to judgement.” But that’s all likely just a negotiating ploy to limit his sentence. About the only thing you can be sure of in the media and Democrat political realms is that the concepts of personal responsibility and accountability will remain in obscurity.

But there is hope. A $250 million lawsuit has been filed against The Washington Post by the high-school kid who was trashed via a partial video that the media ran with without checking any facts. Just as in Smollett’s case, the rush to publish was fueled by the fact that the kid was wearing a MAGA hat (anyone see a pattern here?). The accusations went viral, and the retractions, once the true story emerged, were muted.

I have always said that once The New York Times gave “reporters” permission to be op-ed writers when covering all things Trump, all bets were off for professional journalism, and only the race to be first in that one story that would destroy Trump and his supporters mattered. Proper sourcing and journalistic standards have disappeared, and that will continue as long as the ratings from the business model of trying to be the most vocal Trump critic regardless of the facts stayed up.

Well, another variable has now entered the money equation — the prospect of being on the wrong end of a major libel suit — and The Washington Post is just the first of many in this case. Granted, $250 million might be a bridge too far, but who knows. The key here is that the traditional defenses that require proof of malice for “public figures” to be liable might not survive. Add to that the fact that when covering “children,” the media is required to take extra care, and there could be real damages that just might get the attention of the “shoot first, question sources second” media.

Relying on the fact that the kid in question was the subject of a viral video and therefore is a “public figure” seems ridiculous on its face. Not surprisingly, it’s really hard to find any reporting on the lawsuit after the first flurry, but counsel for the kid is a very good and media-savvy bulldog, so watch this one carefully. It just might be the case that maybe won’t get us back to media sanity, but could inject a bit of pause into media bias. Accountability indeed."

ABC obtained a copy of the now-infamous check, which can be viewed here.

The check was made out to Abimbola Osundairo, one of the two brothers who allegedly carried out the fake hate crime, on January 23 — six days before the “attack.” Olabinjo Osundairo is the name of the other brother involved in the case.

ABC reported:

Sources close to Smollett told ABC News the actor was starting to train for an upcoming music video titled “Don’t Go,” in which he had to appear shirtless. ABC News obtained a calendar entry of Smollett’s that indicates the video was scheduled to be filmed Feb. 23. The $3,500 check was $600 per week for the workout plan, plus $100 per week for the nutrition plan, over five weeks, a source close to Smollett told ABC News.

According to Smollett, he was targeted in the streets of downtown Chicago on January 29 by two white Trump supporters for being gay and black. The two brothers physically assaulted him and called him a “n*****” and a “f*****,” he claimed. Smollett also claimed they tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him, and told him he was in “MAGA country” — a reference to Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.”

About two weeks before the “attack,” Smollett received a threatening letter with the acronym “MAGA” written in the return address space and contained a drawing of a curly-haired stick-figure being hanged with a noose by another stick-figure. “You will die black f***,” it read in cutout letters from magazines.

According to Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson, the attack on January 29 was staged by Smollett, and the threatening letter was also sent by him.

Appearing on “Good Morning America” on Monday, Johnson said the brothers told authorities that the $3,500 check was really given to them to carry out the attack.

“Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave,” said the police chief. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

“It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something, it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this,” he added.

At a press conference last week, Johnson told reporters of the Smollett case: “To be quite honest, it’s shameful. It painted this city that we all love and work hard in a negative connotation. To insinuate and to stage a hate crime of that nature — when he knew, as a celebrity, it would get a lot of attention — it’s despicable.”

Smollett surrendered himself to police at 5 A.M. on Thursday morning after he was officially charged by the Cook County, Illinois state attorney’s office with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

In video posted on Twitter by Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk last week, as well as additional footage published by Campus Reform, which is owned and operated by the Leadership Institute, a man wearing a black T-shirt and carrying a backpack repeatedly attacks a smaller man, Hayden Williams, who was helping TPUSA recruit students on the campus.

The confrontation took place Tuesday at the Upper Sproul Plaza, where campus police were called amid reports that a conservative activist was being assaulted. The Daily Californian, the student-run paper that was the first outlet to report the incident, reported that police were told that at around 3:29 p.m. Tuesday two males approached the TPUSA table and began to argue with the representatives.

Follow-up reports have since noted that the argument appears to have centered around signs TPUSA were displaying saying “Hate crime hoaxes hurt real victims” and reading “This is MAGA Country,” references to the notorious Jussie Smollett case, which Chicago police say was a hoax.

When Williams began to record the increasingly belligerent conversation, the man in the black shirt grew violent, slapping the activist’s phone out of his hand, calling him “racist,” and threatening him — at one point even declaring that he’d “shoot” him, as Williams’ recording shows.

A video taken by a witness shows the attacker shove Williams repeatedly and then punch him squarely in the face, which resulted in Williams having a severely swollen left eye, as shown in a photo tweeted out by Daily Wire contributor Bradley Devlin:

My friend, Hayden, wants to thank all of you for the love and support. He’s giving you a wink, and wanted to let you know you’ll be hearing from him soon! pic.twitter.com/6kPmFZgQgz — Brad Devlin (@bradleydevlin) February 21, 2019

Below is a compilation video of the footage of the attack produced by Campus Reform (warning: language and violence):

Williams has since told Campus Reform that he noticed that some of the witnesses to the brutal attack were “laughing.”

“Some students nearby tabling were laughing, even one guy was smiling while I was being attacked and trying to hand me his flyer as a joke,” he said. “The idea is free speech has consequences … which include you getting assaulted if they find you promoting ideas others don’t agree with.”

After tweeting out the initial footage of the incident, Kirk issued a statement Thursday in which he called out the double standard of the media and the Left’s “tolerance” mantra.

“This assault reveals the hate and anger so many on the left harbor and that our student activists encounter on a daily basis,” said Kirk. “Our amazing grassroots organizers courageously face threats of violence and discrimination as they fight for the right for conservative voices to be heard on college campuses. I am proud of how our student activists at UC Berkeley comported themselves in what was a very scary and difficult situation. Sadly, if the roles were reversed and a conservative student wearing a MAGA hat had attacked a member of a leftist organization, the story would be a leading headline on the nightly news across all major networks. This is a hate crime pure and simple and the suspect should be held accountable.”

In response to the incident, school officials have condemned all forms of “violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason,” and say they will take appopriate action against the suspect. Multiple school officials have made a point of stressing that they had not yet confirmed if the attacker was a student at the school.

Chicago Police said the $3,500 check in question, made out to Abimbola Osundairo, is one of they key pieces of evidence against the ""Empire"" actor, who they say staged an attack on himself last month because he was dissatisfied with his salary on the series.

According to police, Smollett paid Osundairo and his brother, Olabinjo Osundairo, to carry out the assault, which the actor said was a hate crime.

The check is just one piece of the case against Smollett, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told ""Good Morning America"" Monday.

""There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened,"" Johnson said.

His remarks followed a scathing press conference Thursday in which Johnson accused Smollett of committing the alleged crime ""for personal gain,"" adding that the actor owes an ""apology to the city he smeared.""

""Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud in the process,"" Johnson said. ""And why? The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary. So he concocted a story about being attacked.""

Smollett has been charged with one count of felony disorderly conduct in connection with falsely filing a police report. He has not yet entered a plea, but reportedly maintained his innocence while on the set of ""Empire"" last week.

“I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this,” Smollett told the cast and crew, according to TMZ.

Fox, which produces ""Empire,"" later announced that Smollett would be suspended in order to ""avoid further disruption on set.""

But some are standing by Smollett. Terrence Howard, who plays Smollett's father on ""Empire,"" defended him, sharing a video of Smollett playing with his young son and writing, ""The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly.""

“His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide,"" Howard continued. ""Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.""

Smollett’s attorneys said Thursday that the “presumption of innocence” was disregarded for Smollett.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” Smollett’s legal team said in a statement. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election.

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Smollett is expected back in court on March 14, at which point he will enter a plea.

It's starting to look like a distinct possibility,[],https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/02/25/USAT/5d92312c-54b4-4753-a93f-76e4a6388973-bill_daley_mayor_election.JPG,"['starting', 'bill', 'griffin', 'daley', 'citys', 'look', 'possibility', 'elect', 'chicago', 'political', 'million', 'city', 'mayor', 'distinct', 'democratic']","CHICAGO – Ahead of Tuesday’s hotly contested mayoral election here, Bill Daley dropped by Sunday services at one of the city’s largest African-American congregations with Rep. Bobby Rush to make the case that Chicagoans should give yet another Daley the opportunity to lead.

Daley, 70, spoke briefly to the congregants at New Beginnings Church about a need for Chicago to “move forward” together. He left it to Rush, the former Black Panther-turned-longtime Democratic congressman, to do the heavy lifting.

Rush said voters should look at the Daley name as a trusted brand akin to Cadillac or Nike.

Bill's father, Mayor Richard J. Daley, led the city for 21 years, and his older brother, Mayor Richard M. Daley, for 22.

Rush noted that President Bill Clinton picked Bill Daley to serve as U.S. Commerce secretary and President Barack Obama recruited him to as his White House chief of staff.

The congressman, however, made no mention of his own complicated history with the Daleys.

The first Mayor Daley, Bill's father, eyed the Illinois chapter of Black Panthers Party that Rush helped found with suspicion – a cloud that hovered when Chicago police raided a West Side apartment in December 1969 and killed Rush’s fellow Black Panthers Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.

Rush made no reference to his unsuccessful bid in 1999 to unseat Bill’s old brother. At the time, he accused Richard M. Daley of leading with ""exclusion and cronyism.""

“I hear some rumblings – some nonsense in the neighborhoods,” Rush told the congregation. “We’re not tired of the Daleys. We’re not Daley-fatigued. You don’t have fatigue for something or somebody you know. Somebody who will work for you. Somebody who has been tried and true. It’s absurd when I hear something like that.”

In an era when Americans appear to be increasingly averse to political dynasties (see: Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton) and the Democratic Party is shifting to the left (see: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders), it might seem a stretch for the moderate Democratic scion of one of America’s most famous political families to have a shot at winning office in one of the nation’s bluest cities.

Yet ahead of Election Day here, polls suggest that Daley is in good position to finish among the top of the field of 14 candidates vying to succeed Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who opted not to run for a third term.

If no candidate wins a majority of the vote Tuesday – a scenario that polls show is highly likely – the top two vote-getters will face off in an April 2 runoff.

Daley, former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle lead the crowded field with 14 percent each, according to a poll published Sunday by 270 Strategies. They are trailed closely by three other candidates: Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza (10 percent), former Chicago School Board President Gery Chico (9 percent) and businessman Willie Wilson (9 percent).

“All I’ve asked from the beginning is to give me a break,” Daley told USA TODAY Saturday. “Give me a chance to be out there as Bill Daley. Rich has been gone – last time he ran was 12 years ago. Rahm’s been a pretty big force for eight years and a lot of stuff has happened.

""In some people’s minds, Rich Daley maybe did a great job. Others say he didn’t do a good job. From day one, I just said give me a fair shot, and I think the people of Chicago have gave me that.”

Rahm's out:Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's bombshell news leaves city at crossroads

The race has been shaped by a bombshell political scandal. Federal authorities last month charged Democratic Alderman Ed Burke, a 50-year veteran of the City Council and chairman of its powerful finance committee, with attempted extortion for allegedly trying to shake down officials of a company that operates dozens of Burger King franchises in Illinois.

Four candidates with ties to Burke – Daley, Preckwinkle, Mendoza and Chico – have been dubbed by their rivals the “Burke 4.” But Daley, whose brother received political donations from Burke over the years, has been seen as the least closely tied among them, and so has suffered the least tarnish.

Burke hosted a fundraiser for Preckwinkle last year that raised more than $100,000, and her administration hired Burke’s son to a high-level position in the country. Mendoza was married at Burke’s home. Chico got his start in Chicago politics as an aide to Burke.

But more than political corruption, voters say the city's financial stability is their top concern, according to the 270 Strategies poll.

Chicago faces more than $28 billion in unmet municipal worker pension obligations, a challenge exacerbated by residents leaving the city in droves. Chicago has one of the highest big-city homicide rates in the nation, at a time when killings nationwide are near a historic low.

At the heart of Daley’s pitch, he says he’s the only candidate who has the mix of high-level political and executive experience to lead a city in dire straits.

Daley has never held elective office. In addition to serving as Clinton’s Commerce secretary and Obama’s chief of staff, he chaired Al Gore’s losing 2000 presidential campaign and has held senior executive roles at J.P. Morgan and SBC Communications.

Obama, the former Illinois senator who launched his political career from Chicago, has not endorsed a candidate in the race. Neither has Clinton. Gore and former Democratic National Chairman Howard Dean have endorsed Daley.

Daley has vowed to build up the city’s 77 neighborhoods. He says he would freeze property taxes, but would consider implementing a commuter tax and cutting waste to address the city’s fiscal crisis.

“The biggest thing we’ve lost over the last 40 some years is the black middle class,"" Daley said. ""We had an enormous black middle class and Chicago was the envy of the country. That changed.”

Daley has been helped by his huge campaign war chest, which allowed him to establish an early and consistent presence on television.

He’s raised more than $8.7 million, including $2 million from Ken Griffin, the billionaire head of the venture capital firm Citadel.

Griffin also donated $36 million to the campaigns of former Republican Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, whose business-friendly “turnaround agenda” was unpopular in Democratic Chicago.

Daley co-chaired Rauner’s transition team in 2014.

More:Billionaire Ken Griffin donates $10 million to help Chicago police curb murders, shootings

A dark money group, Fight Back for a Better Tomorrow, has spent about $1.2 million on advertising highlighting Daley’s ties to Griffin and Rauner. Surrogates for other candidates have pointed to the Griffin donation and Daley’s time on Rauner’s transition team as reason for voters to be suspicious.

Karen Lewis, a former president of the Chicago Teachers Union, has endorsed Preckwinkle.

“This billionaire’s double donation to Bill Daley is all the proof you need to understand that he wants things to continue as they are, with the wealthy on top and the rest of us stuck at the bottom,” she said.“The office of mayor is nobody’s inheritance.”

Daley said he felt compelled for the good of the state to assist Rauner during his transition, just as Republicans did with Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

He pushed back against criticism for taking money from Griffin, who he noted is one of the city’s most generous philanthropists.

“I don’t agree with all his politics, and he doesn’t agree with mine,” Daley said. “But if we’re going to say to people like Ken Griffin, who have a business in this city and give enormous sums to the city, that you know what? We don’t want you here – you say that to people—good luck. (It’s like) you’re in New York with Amazon, chasing everybody out of here.”

Early in the campaign, University of Illinois at Chicago political scientist Dick Simpson predicted Chicagoans weren’t ready to put another Daley in office.

Simpson, a former Chicago alderman, said Daley has managed to beat expectations by outspending his opponents. He’s outraised his closest competitor, Preckwinkle, by more than $4 million.

Still, Simpson said, with the amount Daley has spent, he should be in a stronger position going into Election Day.

“Even Richie Daley never raised more than $7 million in any of his mayoral election campaigns,"" Simpson said. ""Usually it was less than $3 million that he spent. And yet he got reelected five times.

“With the money Bill has, if he were going to catch fire, that would have already happened by now.”"

CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago judge says “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett can travel out-of-state to meet his lawyers while he’s free on bond on charges he falsely reported being attacked by two masked men.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s attorneys, who say he’s innocent.

Kavanagh says attorney Mark Geragos, who’s based in Los Angeles, is Smollett’s lead attorney. She says a defense lawyer asked Monday that Smollett be allowed to travel to California and New York for meetings with his legal team.

Chicago police charged Smollett with disorderly conduct. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett, who is black and gay, staged a racist and homophobic attack , then told police his attackers yelled racial and anti-gay slurs and referenced President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Last week was a doozy for Khloé Kardashian, who learned her unfaithful baby daddy, Tristan Thompson, was unfaithful yet again. That wasn’t a shocker; what was, however, was who he was caught diddling: sister Kylie‘s ride or die, Jordyn Woods. Dude is nasty; he didn’t even care that she is/was basically an honorary KarJenner.

Lots has happened in the ensuing days, with dozens of stories covering every nook and cranny of the situation. But the best might be the rumours that started swirling that Khloé, who is no stranger to heartbreak, would be the next Bachelorette. Many people loved the idea because they want their girl to find real love (because apparently that’s where she would find it, on a TV dating show). Her sister Kim, on the other hand, disagreed. Hard.

Fake fucking news big time!!!! https://t.co/sbI7JbSPpC — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) February 23, 2019

The Bachelorette‘s showrunner, Mike Fleiss, tweeted back, saying Kim doesn’t have a clue as to what’s going on. Oh, Mike. Why would you even go there?

Oh really????? Wait a minute…. https://t.co/fe5xhzvMLR — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) February 24, 2019

Then Kim showed her receipts.

But Fleiss apparently is a glutton for punishment and keep teasing the “news.” Enter Khloé. And if you thought she would be handing out roses to randoms, THINK AGAIN.

I’m not fucking clickbait right now. Stop or you will be hearing from my lawyers. How insensitive!! https://t.co/vTKi83nLUJ — Khloé (@khloekardashian) February 24, 2019

Message received, loud and clear. One would think. But with Fleiss, you never know.

Kylie unfollowed Tristan on Instagram … but not Jordyn, hmm

While Khloé was at the centre of last week’s drama, let’s not forget her sister, Kylie, who might be the real victim in this massive mess. Yes, Khloé was cheated on for the umpteeth time but it put Kylie in quite the predicament: her sister or her sister from another mister?

Well, based on her Instagram follows, Kylie is definitely done with Tristan and, like sisters Kim and Kourtney, hit “unfollow” on Thompson’s profile. But People reports that Kylie and other sister Kendall still follow Jordyn. Interesting.

R. Kelly can’t afford his $100,000 bail so he spent the night in jail, hahahahahahahahaha

As you probably already know, R. Kelly was arrested and indicted on Friday on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four alleged victims. The Chicago judge set bond at $1 million and in order to be released, he needed to pay $100,000. But as of Sunday afternoon, Page Six reported Kelly remained in jail because he couldn’t pony up the cash.

“This is someone who should be wealthy,” his attorney, Steven Greenberg, said, implying that Kelly is broke because of bad contracts and mismanagement. “I don’t think he even owns the rights to [his hit song] ‘I Believe I Can Fly.'” Ooooooh, wellllllll. Another court appearance is scheduled for Monday.

Jussie Smollett might have evidence to dispute accusations

The Jussie Smollett case has been a gong show of epic proportions, but according to a new report, the actor has evidence that could work in his favour.

TMZ has documents that back Smollett’s claims that the cheque he wrote brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo weren’t to help him stage his attack, but rather for nutrition and exercise services.

Written on the memo line of the cheque read “5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go,” reports the gossip site. “Don’t Go” refers to Jussie’s song, of which he was planning to make a video that would feature him shirtless. Smollett wanted to be as hot for it as possible and needed the bodybuilders’ help to lose 20 pounds.

In addition to the cheque is also a series of texts outlining a healthy eating plan for Jussie.

We’ll see how this plays out but it might not all be downhill for Smollett. Is it too little, too late, though?

Ariana Grande is insisting only clear bags can be brought into her concerts for her upcoming tour

Ariana Grande isn’t taking any chances with her upcoming tour. The singer revealed on Sunday that if you plan on being in the Sweetener/Thank U, Next audience, she wants her fans to buy a very specific accessory if they plan on toting a bag to the show.

Her request comes after her 2017 concert in Manchester was the target of a terrorist attack in which 23 people died and 139 were wounded, more than half of them children. While the venues in which Ari will play don’t typically require clear bags, Ticketmaster is stating that all bags being brought into Grande’s shows must be “100% clear” and made of “clear plastic, vinyl, or PVC.” Understood."

The victory for Peter Farrelly's true-life story of a gay black pianist who strikes up an unlikely friendship with his Italian-American driver in 1960s America lit up social media, sparking a savage backlash over what critics see as its ""whitesplaining"" racial politics.

Veteran African American filmmaker Spike Lee stormed briefly out of the auditorium as the top prize at the 91st Academy Awards was announced on Sunday, later hinting that he thought it was a historically poor choice.

Lee was dumbfounded back in 1990 when ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" a movie deemed by many to be egregiously tone deaf on race, won best picture while his widely lauded ""Do the Right Thing"" couldn't even muster a nomination.

Three decades later, Lee was in the running for best film with ""BlacKkKlansman"" and appeared exasperated to lose to another film about race relations set largely in a car.

""BlacKkKlansman"" director Spike Lee, pictured with his best original screenplay Oscar, described himself as 'snakebit' FREDERIC J. BROWN, AFP

""I'm snakebit -- every time someone's driving someone, I lose,"" Lee half-joked backstage, visibly frustrated despite taking home a consolation prize -- an Oscar for screenwriting, his first in a competitive category.

An evening overshadowed by a controversy over race had a fitting coda when Lee -- after pleading for US voters to ""be on the right side of history"" when they vote in the 2020 presidential election -- took a Twitter beating from Donald Trump.

""Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President,"" Trump tweeted Monday, although he hadn't been named by the director.

- 'Repellently obtuse' -

The top prize -- the third statuette of the night for ""Green Book"" -- came after its star Mahershala Ali, an African American and two years ago the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar, bagged the prize for best supporting actor.

Oscar winners and nominees Gal ROMA, AFP

The film, an audience favorite that has taken more than $140 million in box offices worldwide, it has been embroiled in controversy since its premiere.

The real-life family of Ali's character, the late pianist Don Shirley, denounced the film as a ""symphony of lies"" while others described it as yet another ""white savior movie.""

Ali's co-star Viggo Mortensen was hardly a balm to the roiling controversy when, during a Q&A on the film in November, he used the N-word.

On the surface, the academy's selections on Sunday looked about as diverse as could be expected, with superhero blockbuster ""Black Panther,"" a movie with a mainly black cast, scooping three awards.

Three of the four acting prizes went to African Americans and an Egyptian first-generation American, while black women won in costume design and production design for the first time, both for ""Black Panther.""

Richard Brody argued in The New Yorker, however, that the ""repellently obtuse"" ""Green Book"" proved the academy had changed nothing meaningful since being berated over the 2016-17 #OscarsSoWhite controversy.

- 'Woke liberals' -

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found that the ""well-intentioned white/black balance"" came across as glib, while the London-based Independent website bemoaned its ""relentless, almost uncanny mediocrity.""

Oscar winner Mahershala Ali, who won the best supporting actor prize for ""Green Book,"" took one of three statuettes for the film including best picture FREDERIC J. BROWN, AFP

As is often the case, there was a backlash to the backlash, from commentators complaining of an industry crippled by its fear of offending audiences and an obsession with the appearance of political correctness rather than genuine reform.

""No matter how woke you go it's never. good. enough,"" tweeted Claire Lehmann, the founding editor of online magazine Quillette.

Conservative entertainment blog Hollywood in Toto, which considers Tinseltown's liberals as something of a bete noire, described the bonding theme in ""Green Book"" as ""noble.""

""Saying movies like 'Green Book' make white movie goers feel better is insulting,"" said editor Christian Toto. ""Why would you need to be white to enjoy a beautifully told story about moving past one's bigotry?""

Toto evoked the allegedly faked recent hate attack on black ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett to argue that the US movie industry is often too quick to see racism where none exists.

The annual UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report, published last week, noted that the ever-broadening landscape created by Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and other streaming services had ""created a tailwind"" for racial diversity.

The number of minority actors with lead roles in films increased from 13.9 percent in 2016 to 19.8 percent in 2017 -- a far from perfect statistic but a sizeable improvement, nonetheless.

""It sounds absurd to suggest people who claim to be against racism, like woke liberals in and out of Hollywood, would be against a film that promotes racial healing,"" said Toto."

On Saturday, Smerconish said, ""Like pot, prostitution should be legal, cleaned up, regulated. Healthy. Let me be clear, of course, no woman should be forced into this line of work and anyone who would attempt to make them indentured servants should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. But not a 77-year-old guy who lost his wife of 48 years back in 2011. As it is, I tweeted, it represents the largest waste of resources since Jussie Smollett.""

I agree with Mike that prostitution should be legalized, but Smerconish' claims about Robert Kraft are simply ridiculous.

Robert Kraft is anything but a regular 77-year-old man with a lonely heart who hasn't had female ""companionship"" since his wife passed back in 2011.

He's a billionaire, one of the most powerful men in all of professional sports and who's been dating a gorgeous 39-year-old actress for the last five years. Short on female companionship? I think not.

And it's not a random chance that Kraft just happened to stroll into the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida.

Kraft had to be made aware of what was going on there before he chose that ""spa"" to visit. Underage girls were forced into slavery to sexually service men like Kraft on the premises.

And to Smerconish's point, Kraft is lucky to only be charged with a misdemeanor. The investigators say they have video evidence of what was going on there, so if Kraft was with an underage girl and they can prove it, he should be charged for that as well.

To make another point, suddenly libertarians and conservatives are monitoring the way police resources are used? Do you mean closing down a human trafficking operation is not worthy of their time and attention?

Spending time with underage sex slaves is not a ""process crime."" It's statutory rape and conspiracy with a sex trafficker.

If Kraft knowingly engaged with sex with underage girls, who spoke no English and were captive, he should be forced to sell the New England Patriots, in my opinion."

Chicago – A Chicago judge says “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett can travel out-of-state to meet his lawyers while he’s free on bond on charges he falsely reported being attacked by two masked men.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s attorneys, who say he’s innocent.

Kavanagh says attorney Mark Geragos, who’s based in Los Angeles, is Smollett’s lead attorney. She says a defense lawyer asked Monday that Smollett be allowed to travel to California and New York for meetings with his legal team.

Smollett was charged last week with disorderly conduct. Chicago police say Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the attack then told police his attackers yelled racial and anti-gay slurs and referenced President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

He was released last week after posting $10,000 cash. He was ordered to surrender his passport.

Jussie Smollett of the TV show ""Empire"" has recently been in the media and it's not a pretty story.

The short of it: One night in Chicago he claimed that he was the victim of a hate crime. He said assailants poured bleach on him, roughed him up and hung a rope around his neck all the time yelling racism and homophobic slurs. The Chicago police questioned two men, who are brothers, as possible suspects in the incident. Turns out the men knew Smollett and have worked on ""Empire.""

The men later said that Smollett paid them to create the hate crime. At present, we don't know the full story or whether a hate crime actually occurred or if Smollett orchestrated this incident. But, many are already criticizing the actor for doing this during Black History Month.

Being black and gay and open about it is brave, and comes with it much hate. So, no matter what the outcome of this incident, Smollett has already suffered, and possible been broken by that hate. But, either way, it is heinous - the hate crime or the invention of a hate crime. And, while we don't know yet which is true, we need to realize that one person is not an entire group of people, whether black or LGBT.

There are other people of color who we can celebrate this Black History Month. How about Bayard Rustin, chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington; Janet Mock, activist, author and most recently writer for the TV show ""Pose;"" Alice Walker, author, poet, and advocate; E. Denise Simmons, former mayor of Cambridge, Mass., who during her 2008-2009 term was the first openly lesbian African-American mayor in the United States; Angela Davis, political advocate, scholar, and author; and James Baldwin, author and activist. There are many, many more, but let me end with my sister from Gay Liberation Front, Marsha P. Johnson, who helped create the first trans organization in the nation Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries … STAR!

On Saturday morning, the 4 million subscribers (newspaper and web) to the New York Times read this headline above the fold on the front page: “Patriots Owner Facing Charges After Sex Sting.” That’s commissioner Roger Goodell’s morning paper. Inside, in the lead story of the Times sports section, respected NFL correspondent Ken Belson wrote: “However the case is resolved, the episode is an embarrassment to a league that likes to portray itself as a pillar of moral rectitude but has struggled to shake an image that its players, employees and team owners treat women poorly.”

“KRAFT FACES CHARGES OF SOLICITATION,” blared the front page of Kraft’s hometown Boston Globe, which landed on newsstands all over his beloved six-state New England region.

The NFL’s Personal Conduct Policy mandates that owners and club officials “will be subject to more significant discipline” for violations of the policy and reads: “Everyone who is part of the league must refrain from conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the NFL.”

Prostitution. Sex trafficking. Video evidence of Kraft’s involvement, according to police. The most negative of headlines and news coverage, focused on one of the most important owners in recent league history, on the steward of the franchise that has won more Super Bowls in one era (six) than any franchise in league history … and leading the news on a day with Washington imploding. Add to that the specter of the NFL’s incessant recruitment of women as fans and consumers and fantasy football players, and add to that the feeling by many in the outer boroughs of the league that Kraft is especially close to the league office. It just ratchets up the pressure on Goodell’s prospective judgment in the case. In Goodell’s 12-and-a-half years as commissioner, he hasn’t faced a situation like this one. Which makes it difficult to forecast what Goodell will do to Kraft, if the charges are true.

Story continues

But there are clues.

Everything about the charge of Kraft on two occasions soliciting a prostitute—one used against her will in a case of human trafficking—has to be prefaced with “if.” The cases arising from a strip-mall spa in Jupiter, Fla., against a cadre of accused men have not been publicly proven, and we’re reminded by the Jussie Smollett case to let the facts surface before passing judgment. Police in Jupiter, Fla., have alleged Kraft twice frequented a spa accused of prostitution, and the police say they have incriminating video of Kraft. A spokesman for Kraft “categorically” denied involvement “in any illegal activity.” The league said it was aware of the case and was monitoring developments, the NFL’s euphemism for, “We’re buying time.” So that’s where it stands this morning.

But if the charges against Kraft prove to be true, I believe the Ray Rice precedent will come into play. And that would not be good news for Kraft. I believe if Kraft is found guilty, commissioner Roger Goodell couldn’t give Kraft a hefty fine alone. The problem with a fine of Kraft? The last sitting owner to be seriously sanctioned by Goodell, Indianapolis’ Jim Irsay, was suspended for six games and fined $500,000 for driving while impaired. That sort of fine, on its own, would be the ultimate slap on the wrist to a man Forbes says is worth $6.8 billion. To be exact, $500,000 would be one-fourteenth of 1 percent of Kraft’s worth. Next to nothing, really. That’s part of the reason why I believe Kraft, if he is guilty, is more likely than not to be suspended.

Think back to the Rice case in 2014. Rice, a Ravens running back, had an altercation with his fiancé at an Atlantic City hotel, and Goodell suspended Rice for two games. The light punishment was derided by the public—particularly women’s groups—and Goodell looked feckless when video of the altercation surfaced and showed Rice decking his fiancé with a single punch. The league revised its punishment, suspending Rice indefinitely, but by then it was too late. Goodell was ripped nationally for running an initially shoddy investigation of the case and for being soft on domestic violence.

So now, if Kraft is found to have used prostitutes being employed against their will in a human-trafficking scheme, the commissioner will have two choices:

Go light on Kraft if there’s no proof he knew the woman or women were employed against their will. That seems unlikely. When the NFL suspends players for using PEDs, even if the supplement was bought over the counter at a reputable vitamin store, players can’t use the excuse that they didn’t know a substance banned by the NFL was part of the supplement. Similarly, I doubt Goodell would accept a defense of “I didn’t know the women were part of a trafficking scheme.” Someone already involved in an illegal activity would not garner empathy for pleading ignorance there.

Give Kraft a significant sanction—a multi-week (or longer) suspension from all Patriots and league activities, and a fine. This would show the league taking a stand against the burgeoning American issue of human-trafficking (it is already the cause of highly respected Colts coach Frank Reich), as well as showing the public it won’t kid-glove a high-profile owner.

I think it would be the latter. Again, the case is still unproven, and it’s highly likely Goodell will wait to see the corroborating evidence.

But if found culpable, Kraft might be wise to suggest a third option. He has been generous to important causes, small and large. In addition to a multi-week suspension, he could agree to lead an NFL initiative to help fight human trafficking, and provide significant seed money for the project. That might be one way to limit the amount of long-term personal damage. Deadspin reported that Kraft already has supported the fight against human trafficking with a $100,000 donation in 2015 to the Boston-based “My Life My Choice,” which supports human-trafficking victims. This is a desperately needed cause in the United States and the world, and Kraft’s renewed backing of the fight could be crucial in the fight.

Some would suggest Kraft deserves to have his ownership of the team stripped. I don’t see that happening. When Carolina owner Jerry Richardson was accused by former staff members of sexual and personal improprieties late in 2017 by Sports Illustrated, Richardson stepped away from the team and sold the franchise six weeks before the NFL fined him for his actions. Harboring a culture of intimidation inside his organization, and pressuring multiple female employees for sexual-related favors over a period of years, as Richardson did, could have led to him being stripped of his team. But Goodell never had to rule on that because Richardson voluntarily stepped away.

What would wound Kraft deeply, if found guilty, is knowing that damage he’d have done to his name and his brand—and it would be the third strike against his dynasty. The Spygate scandal tarnished Bill Belichick in 2007 (costing him $500,000 and the team a first-round draft choice), and the Deflategate scandal in 2015 got Tom Brady suspended for four games and cost the team another first-round pick. Because this violation has nothing to do with the competitive aspects of football, it wouldn’t be subject to draft-pick penalty. Goodell would hand down a penalty he feels is just. But Kraft being found guilty would be the third strike against the best long-term team in modern football history, even though it would have nothing to do with football.

One last point: If Goodell has to rule on Kraft, it will be watched as closely as any recent ruling he’s made—by the football community and by women in many communities monitoring a business that has talked a good game about women but has not always walked the walk. It’d be naïve to think Goodell’s clumsy handling of Rice would not be brought up to him by a largely new staff of PR operatives inside the NFL. That matters.

For now, the legal process will play out, in Jupiter, Fla., and in New England and inside the NFL offices in New York, and the consequences to a surprising story will be mulled. “We’re as equally stunned as anyone else,” Jupiter police chief Daniel Kerr said Friday. He’s not alone.

CHICAGO - A Chicago judge says ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett can travel out-of-state to meet his lawyers while he's free on bond on charges he falsely reported being attacked by two masked men.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's attorneys, who say he's innocent.

Kavanagh says attorney Mark Geragos, who's based in Los Angeles, is Smollett's lead attorney. She says a defence lawyer asked Monday that Smollett be allowed to travel to California and New York for meetings with his legal team.

Smollett was charged last week with disorderly conduct. Chicago police say Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the attack then told police his attackers yelled racial and anti-gay slurs and referenced President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

He was released last week after posting $10,000 cash. He was ordered to surrender his passport."

Howard had long been suspicious about the 36-year-old’s claim that he was the victim of a racist, homophobic attack in Chicago last month — and periodically confronted him about inconsistencies in his story as the investigation unfolded, TMZ reports.

Then, when Olabinjo Osundairo — who worked as an extra on “Empire” — and his brother Abimbola were arrested as possible attackers earlier this month, Howard blew up at Smollett and told him to confess, sources from the set tell the site.

When Smollett himself was arrested last week for allegedly filing a false report after allegedly paying the brothers to stage the attack, Howard had a meltdown on set and refused to come out of his trailer for most of the day, according to TMZ.

Smollett returned to the set that night to apologize and profess his innocence, but his TV dad was nowhere to be seen, the site reports.

Nevertheless, Howard defended Smollett in an Instagram post over the weekend, saying: “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide.”"

Conservative radio host Kevin McCullough was one Twitter user who promoted the notion that Harris was Smollett’s aunt:

McCullough deleted his tweet after it generated a considerable amount of ridicule.

The claim that Kamala Harris is Jussie Smollett’s aunt was offered by a number of social media users, but the documentation presented with it was flimsy at best. In fact, the most substantial piece of “evidence” presented to support this conspiracy theory was that Smollett’s mother and the California senator share a surname:

Sharing a last name does not constitute proof that these two women are siblings, however. In fact, the surname “Harris” is one of the most popular surnames in the United States, ranking in the top 30 of the 2010 U.S. Census. We’ve examined the biographical information available for these two public figures and found that their family branches simply do not intersect.

Kamala Harris, who was born in Oakland, California, has a single sibling, a younger sister named Maya who was born in Illinois. In order for Kamala to be Jussie Smollett’s aunt, Maya — who is only 16 years older than Smollett — would have to his mother. However, Smollett’s mother’s first name is Janet, not Maya, and she is from New Orleans, not Illinois.

Neither did we find any familial relationship between Kamala Harris and the Smollett family through marriage that might provide a basis for referring to Kamala as Jussie’s “aunt.” Jussie Smollett was born in Santa Rosa, California, to Janet (Harris) Smollett and Joel Smollett Sr. (who migrated to the U.S. from Russia and Poland). Jussie said the family moved to Queens when he was two years old, and afterwards, according to the New York Times, he grew up “bouncing with [his] parents and siblings between New York and Los Angeles, as the kids pursued careers in modeling, acting and music.”

Neither Kamala Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, nor Maya Harris’ husband, Tony West, has any discernible connection to Jussie’s parents. Emhoff hails from New York, graduated USC law school, is a prominent entertainment and intellectual property lawyer in Los Angeles, and has two grown children from a previous relationship. West hails from San Francisco, graduated Stanford law school, serves as general counsel and Chief Legal Officer at Uber, and has one daughter with his wife Maya."

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson appeared on “Good Morning America” on Monday morning to discuss the Jussie Smollett case.

Smollett, an actor on the TV show “Empire”, was arrested last week. Prosecutors charged him with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report in connection with his allegation that he was targeted in a hate-crime attack in Chicago.

Johnson said he hopes the case doesn’t cause people to become sceptical of real hate crime victims.

Smollett denies he staged the attack, and is pleading not guilty.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said he hopes the Jussie Smollett case doesn’t make people sceptical of real hate crime victims.

Johnson discussed Smollett’s recent arrest in an appearance on “Good Morning America” on Monday morning.

The “Empire” actor was charged last week with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report in connection to an incident last month in which he alleged two men beat him, put a noose around his neck, and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

Investigators said they have evidence Smollett staged the attack to garner attention because he was dissatisfied with his salary on “Empire.” Smollett denies he staged the attack, and is pleading not guilty.

On “GMA” Monday morning, Johnson lamented the impact that Smollett’s accusation could have on victims of hate crimes.

“I just hope people don’t judge other folks who are victims of these types of crimes, because this is just one particular incident and that’s the damaging part of it,” Johnson told host Robin Roberts.

He added: “There are real victims of crimes of that nature, hate crimes, and I just hope that people don’t treat them with scepticism.”

Groups that track hate crimes and support victims of them echoed Johnson’s concern.

“Far too many survivors aren’t believed and don’t get justice for the violence they experience,” the New York Anti-Violence project said in a statement, according to NBC News.

“There’s a concern that now police, instead of saying, ‘Let me investigate,’ they will say, ‘Hmm, I wonder if this is like the Smollett investigation?'” Southern Poverty Law CenterPresident Richard Cohen told the LA Times. “Victims of any crime shouldn’t be viewed with suspicion and that’s what you worry about as a result of the Smollett case.”

Johnson said more evidence is coming

Johnson also said Chicago Police have collected “a lot more evidence” that hasn’t been presented yet.

ABC News also reported on Monday that they had obtained a copy of the check Smollett wrote to one of the men he said attacked him, and that the memo line of the check said the money was for personal training and nutrition services.

At a press conference announcing the charges last week, Johnson said he was angry and offended by the idea that a black man would stage a hate crime for financial gain, as prosecutors suspect Smollett did.

“I know the racial divide that exists here. I know how hard it’s been for our city and our nation to come together. And I also know the disparities and I know the history,” Johnson said. “‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

In response to Smollett’s arrest, Fox announced it will remove him from the final two episodes of this season of “Empire”.

However, all of the facts apparently still have not come forward and now the FBI is challenging reports from the notoriously corrupt Chicago Police Department.

Chicago Police Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a long press conference that the Empire actor wrote the hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself. See below:

However, TMZ recently reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” when they said Jussie sent the letter to himself. One federal law enforcement source told TMZ, “I think he [Johnson] went too far. We’re not there yet.”

TMZ also reports, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson may have also gone too far when he said Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.’” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

TMZ also reports, “There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the ‘attack’ — Bon [Abel Osundairo] wrote, ‘I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.’ Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ‘This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.’” The $3,500 breakdown was reportedly “$600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks,” according to TMZ.

Smollett lawyers released the following statement on Thursday after his arrest:

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett was released on $100,000 bond.

“Thursday was a complete disaster on set after Jussie turned himself into Chicago Police. Terrence was so upset he refused to come out of his trailer for most of the day,” sources reportedly told TMZ. “The actor didn’t believe Jussie’s account from the get-go, he felt the story never added up,” sources said, according to the site.

“We’re told Terrence grilled Jussie periodically as holes began to emerge,” TMZ adds. “Further illustrating his disdain for Jussie … we’re told Terrence was nowhere to be found Thursday night when Jussie addressed the cast and crew. Terrence was not alone in his feelings … we’re told many others on the cast and crew felt Jussie was lying and ultimately that’s why producers decided to remove Jussie from the set for the final 2 episodes … it was just too disruptive.”

Prior to this report coming out, Terrence Howard posted a video of Smollett playing with the youngest Howard child. He captioned the clip, “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell out of you.”

“Nevertheless, it doesn’t take away from what we know happened on Thursday,” TMZ insists. See the Empire star’s message to Jussie Smollett below and stay tuned.

Sources on the set of the hit music drama tell TMZ that after Jussie turned himself into Chicago Police last Thursday, Terrence had a meltdown and refused to come out of his trailer for most of the day.

According to insiders, Howard didn’t believe Smollett’s version about what went down on the night he claims two masked men hurled gay and racial slurs at him and tied a rope around his neck. Terrance reportedly felt the story never added up and he often grilled Jussie in order to make sense out of the mess.

After the two Nigerian-American brothers who allegedly helped Jussie orchestrate the attack were detained by police, Terrence reportedly confronted Jussie once again and demanded he come clean.

According to TMZ, immediately after posting bond, Jussie hit up the “Empire” set following his release and addressed the cast and crew, saying… “I’m sorry I’ve put you all through this and not answered any calls. I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.”

But sources now say that Howard was nowhere to be found when Jussie issued his apology. Many of the cast and crew are said to believe he is lying and that’s why producers decided to remove him from the final two episodes of the season.

News of how Terrance really feels about Jussie comes after he posted a video Saturday seems to be in support of his co-star. The clip shows Smollett playing with a baby, along with the caption “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you” (see the post below).

Howard’s online support of Smollett was criticized by many, and when one commenter said Terrance was supporting a “lying felon,” the “Hustle & Flow” star fired off a lengthy response.

“The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly,” he said. “His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There’s nothing more harmful than a real friend!”

Smollett’s co-star Gabourey Sidibe also expressed her support in an Instagram post that was swiftly deleted following his arrest. “I know him, I believe him, I stand with him,” she wrote.

The check’s memo line reads, “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go),” which police have corroborated. The check was dated Jan. 23, six days before Smollett claims he was attacked in a hate crime.

Sources close to Smollett told ABC News the actor was starting to train for an upcoming music video titled “Don’t Go,” in which he had to appear shirtless. ABC News obtained a calendar entry of Smollett’s that indicates the video was scheduled to be filmed Feb. 23.

The $3,500 check was $600 per week for the workout plan, plus $100 per week for the nutrition plan, over five weeks, a source close to Smollett told ABC News.

Meanwhile, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, appearing exclusively on ABC’s Good Morning America on Monday, doubled down on his contention that the Empire star fabricated the account.

Johnson said the Osundairo brothers told police that Smollett gave them a $3,500 check to carry out the elaborate scheme.

“Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave,” the police chief told GMA. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

ABC News has also obtained copies of apparent text messages between Smollett and one of the Osundairo brothers, whom he calls “Bon,” in which the two discuss exercise and meal plans in the days preceding the alleged attack. Police confirmed they have the texts.

As previously reported, Smollett, who has consistently denied any role in staging the supposed crime on Jan. 29, turned himself in to police Thursday morning.

A judge set bond at $100,000 and ordered Smollett to surrender his passport. The actor, who pleaded not guilty, was released after posting 10 percent of his bail. His next court appearance is scheduled for March 14.

As you longtime readers know, I try to have a liberal attitude towards comments. I’m pleased to post comments that are quite critical of me or anybody else who posts here, but I draw the line at personal insults and invective. Because I’m the only person who moderates comments, I sometimes slip up and let things through that shouldn’t be there. If you see this, please let me know via e-mail (rod — at — amconmag — dot — com), or otherwise, and I’ll be happy to review the comment and take it down if warranted.

I also reserve the right to refuse to post any comment, for any reason at all. For example, I post comments critical of Israel, but when I judge a comment crosses the line into anti-Semitism, I don’t post it. This is a difficult call to make when readers criticize Jews as Jews. Again, I try to be as liberal-minded as I can, and allow wide discussion, but there is a line. Similarly, I want there to be a robust discussion about race and race relations, but when I get the sense that a particular comment on race is being made from a place of bad faith, or simply that it would make useful discussion harder, I won’t post it.

For the record, I usually don’t post comments that are nothing more than long blocks of text copied from another source. And there are times when I don’t post a comment because it’s so dopey I don’t want it junking up the comments section.

Please do not assume that because I post somebody’s comment, that indicates that I agree with them. You should also not assume that because your comment did not appear, it’s because I sent it to the spam bucket. Alas for us all, the WordPress software has a quirky habit of marking some perfectly fine comments by longtime users as … spam. Your jaw would drop if you saw how much actual spam the filter nets from bots. No kidding, we must get 300 or more spam comments generated by bots for every one comment from a real person the filter nabs. Sometimes those real-person comments are just fine, and I can’t find any reason why it would have gone into the spam bucket. For example, to my recollection, I have never deep-sixed anything by the reader Turmarion, even though he can be a sharp critic of mine. Yet the spam filter seems to grab an unusual number of his comments. I can’t explain it. He’ll write me privately, and I’ll go digging through spam, find his comment, and free it. I feel badly for him, but if I could make this not happen, I would. As imperfe

Y’all don’t see the things that I don’t post, so you (understandably) don’t know how hard I work to try to keep this forum interesting, readable, and a place where all kinds of people can find something interesting there. That requires pruning. I like it when I have time to add an NFR (Note From Rod), but there are times when I’d love to do that, but I’m too busy. There is no rhyme or reason to why I add NFRs. All it means is that I had the time to do it right then.

Anyway, I bring this all up after having just read Scott Alexander’s long explanation for why he stopped the Culture War thread, a subreddit affiliated with his popular Slate Star Codex blog. Alexander (a pseudonym) is a psychiatrist who is generally liberal in his politics and cultural outlook, but whose blog attracts all kinds of readers because it’s really smart and interesting. He had a far, far more difficult job moderating his comments section (and he had volunteer helpers!) than I do, but his explanation for why you have to moderate them is quite good, and I urge you to read it.

In this part, he talks about why a blogger really has to be careful about what he allows into his comments section. It can destroy the blog and the brand of the publication that hosts the blog:

The thing about an online comment section is that the guy who really likes pedophilia is going to start posting on every thread about sexual minorities “I’m glad those sexual minorities have their rights! Now it’s time to start arguing for pedophile rights!” followed by a ten thousand word manifesto. This person won’t use any racial slurs, won’t be a bot, and can probably reach the same standards of politeness and reasonable-soundingness as anyone else. Any fair moderation policy won’t provide the moderator with any excuse to delete him. But it will be very embarrassing for to New York Times to have anybody who visits their website see pro-pedophilia manifestos a bunch of the time. “So they should deal with it! That’s the bargain they made when deciding to host the national conversation!” No, you don’t understand. It’s not just the predictable and natural reputational consequences of having some embarrassing material in a branded space. It’s enemy action. Every Twitter influencer who wants to profit off of outrage culture is going to be posting 24-7 about how the New York Times endorses pedophilia. Breitbart or some other group that doesn’t like the Times for some reason will publish article after article on New York Times‘ secret pro-pedophile agenda. Allowing any aspect of your brand to come anywhere near something unpopular and taboo is like a giant Christmas present for people who hate you, people who hate everybody and will take whatever targets of opportunity present themselves, and a thousand self-appointed moral crusaders and protectors of the public virtue. It doesn’t matter if taboo material makes up 1% of your comment section; it will inevitably make up 100% of what people hear about your comment section and then of what people think is in your comment section. Finally, it will make up 100% of what people associate with you and your brand. The Chinese Robber Fallacy is a harsh master; all you need is a tiny number of cringeworthy comments, and your political enemies, power-hungry opportunists, and 4channers just in it for the lulz can convince everyone that your entire brand is about being pro-pedophile, catering to the pedophilia demographic, and providing a platform for pedophile supporters. And if you ban the pedophiles, they’ll do the same thing for the next-most-offensive opinion in your comments, and then the next-most-offensive, until you’ve censored everything except “Our benevolent leadership really is doing a great job today, aren’t they?” and the comment section becomes a mockery of its original goal.

If you think that I have been too quick to spam-bucket your comment on “race realism,” Jewish influence, and suchlike, I want you to understand that there’s a reason for that, and Alexander explains why. On the other hand, if you think that I allow too much material that comes right up to the line, understand that there’s a reason for that too (that is, I don’t want to run a comments section that turns into an Our Benevolent Leadership forum). This is not easy work. I tell you that not because I want you to give me a cookie, but because I want you to know that I take seriously my job curating these comments, and I want to get better at it. But I know that I can’t please everybody, and often can’t even please myself.

Anyway, though Alexander is a secular liberal, he listens to and takes seriously people who don’t agree with him. In the post I’m quoting from here, he shows a pie chart of a survey he took of SSC subreddit readers. Most of them are left-wing, but not a big majority. This is entirely understandable, given how intelligent and interesting Alexander’s comments are. But, he says, eventually the most contentious categories (“Trump, gender, race, the communist menace, the fascist menace, etc”) began taking over the comments sections.

And then the trolls got involved. Alexander writes:

People settled on a narrative. The Culture War thread was made up entirely of homophobic transphobic alt-right neo-Nazis. I freely admit there were people who were against homosexuality in the thread (according to my survey, 13%), people who opposed using trans people’s preferred pronouns (according to my survey, 9%), people who identified as alt-right (7%), and a single person who identified as a neo-Nazi (who as far as I know never posted about it). Less outrageous ideas were proportionally more popular: people who were mostly feminists but thought there were differences between male and female brains, people who supported the fight against racial discrimination but thought could be genetic differences between races. All these people definitely existed, some of them in droves. All of them had the right to speak; sometimes I sympathized with some of their points. If this had been the complaint, I would have admitted to it right away. If the New York Times can’t avoid attracting these people to its comment section, no way r/ssc is going to manage it. But instead it was always that the the thread was “dominated by” or “only had” or “was an echo chamber for” homophobic transphobic alt-right neo-Nazis, which always grew into the claim that the subreddit was dominated by homophobic etc neo-Nazis, which always grew into the claim that the SSC community was dominated by homophobic etc neo-Nazis, which always grew into the claim that I personally was a homophobic etc neo-Nazi of them all. I am a pro-gay Jew who has dated trans people and votes pretty much straight Democrat. I lost distant family in the Holocaust. You can imagine how much fun this was for me. People would message me on Twitter to shame me for my Nazism. People who linked my blog on social media would get replies from people “educating” them that they were supporting Nazism, or asking them to justify why they thought it was appropriate to share Nazi sites. I wrote a silly blog post about mathematics and corn-eating. It reached the front page of a math subreddit and got a lot of upvotes. Somebody found it, asked if people knew that the blog post about corn was from a pro-alt-right neo-Nazi site that tolerated racists and sexists. There was a big argument in the comments about whether it should ever be acceptable to link to or read my website. Any further conversation about math and corn was abandoned. This kept happening, to the point where I wouldn’t even read Reddit discussions of my work anymore. The New York Times already has a reputation, but for some people this was all they’d heard about me. Some people started an article about me on a left-wing wiki that listed the most offensive things I have ever said, and the most offensive things that have ever been said by anyone on the SSC subreddit and CW thread over its three years of activity, all presented in the most damning context possible; it started steadily rising in the Google search results for my name. A subreddit devoted to insulting and mocking me personally and Culture War thread participants in general got started; it now has over 2,000 readers. People started threatening to use my bad reputation to discredit the communities I was in and the causes I cared about most. Some people found my real name and started posting it on Twitter. Some people made entire accounts devoted to doxxing me in Twitter discussions whenever an opportunity came up. A few people just messaged me letting me know they knew my real name and reminding me that they could do this if they wanted to. Some people started messaging my real-life friends, telling them to stop being friends with me because I supported racists and sexists and Nazis. Somebody posted a monetary reward for information that could be used to discredit me. One person called the clinic where I worked, pretended to be a patient, and tried to get me fired.

And then Scott Alexander, psychiatrist, had a nervous breakdown. I’m not kidding. Read his post to learn more about it.

Please understand that I don’t face anything like the pressures Alexander did, because he’s a much bigger deal than I am. Still, I’m on that spectrum. When I meet readers of this blog in person, they usually say, “How do you deal with all the nasty stuff that comes at you in the comments section?” I tell them truthfully that I don’t notice it. I’ve been an opinion journalist for almost all of the last 30 years, and I have developed dinosaur hide. If you see it posted here, rest assured that it does not bother me. Mostly I laugh at it. And I confess to taking malicious pleasure in sending to oblivion the comments, and the ability to comment, of anonymous keyboard would-be badasses who think they’re standing up to The Man by insulting me in comments that will never see the light of day. They think they’re being all Jack Nicholson (“You can’t handle the truth!”), but I see them as more along the lines of Elmer Fudd, and you see them … not at all.

You’re welcome.

On the up side, I hear from people all the time who praise this comments section, and who say it’s the only one they read. I’m talking about national print and broadcast journalists. One even asked me to put him in touch with commenter Matt in VA, so he could invite Matt to be on TV (Matt had to decline, to protect his job, which depends on his anonymity). Point is, you who work hard to play by the rules and offer good comments should take heart that lots of people read them. This blog gets well over a million unique readers each month; only the tiniest fraction of those readers ever post here … but a lot of those readers do read you regular commenters too. I want to thank you for what you do here, and for helping to make this blog so popular. It’s your blog too.

I love how big you’ve made this blog by your loyalty and your good comments over the years, but when the day comes when I have to spend more time moderating comments as I do writing them, it’s either going to be time to get an intern to help out, or I’m going to have to shut down the comments section, for all the reasons Scott Alexander cut off his connection with the Culture War subreddit. Happily, I don’t see that day coming soon. But note this passage from Alexander’s long post about the effect trolls had on him:

Second, I wanted there to be at least one of these “here’s why we’re removing your ability to comment” articles that was honest, not made of corporate-speak, and less patronizing than “we’re removing the comment section because we value your speech so much and want to promote great conversations”. Hopefully this will be the skeleton key that helps you understand what all those other articles would have said if they weren’t run through fifty layers of PR teams. I would like to give people another perspective on events like Tumblr banning female-presenting nipples or Patreon dropping right-wing YouTubers or Twitter constantly introducing new algorithms that misfire and ban random groups of people. These companies aren’t inherently censorious. They’re just afraid. Everyone is afraid.

That made me rethink my own outrage over Facebook’s having banned for several hours my TAC blogpost about Jussie Smollett’s hate hoax. Yes, it was wrong of them to ban it (as Facebook itself recognized by re-instating the ability of users to share the post a few hours later), but whatever algorithm snared the post was one no doubt designed to stop authentically bad people from sharing evil material. What happened to me was probably about the same thing as this blog’s spam filter capturing a legitimate comment because some word in it triggered the algorithm.

Still, I’m glad the whole thing spurred me to at long last delete Facebook. I will miss the opportunity to reconnect with friends I haven’t been in touch with for ages, but mostly, it wasn’t worth it. If I didn’t need Twitter to do my job, I’d be off of it too. Social media is not good for us. A (secular liberal middle-aged) friend e-mailed this morning to say:

Here’s a serious question/hypothesis absolutely impervious to any kind of scientific-method investigation: How much do digital native kids form their entire identity—the reflexive condescension, the automatic politicization, the ahistorical two-dimensional opinions, the insolent sanctimony, etc.—on social media? From the first, embryonic stages of self-awareness, they have to forge a presentational self that is both distinctive and conformist simultaneous—or even prior—to the organic, fumbling process of constructing an identity IRL, interacting with real people, parents, adults, peers. The result is that these kids are walking, talking Twitter avatars. They are uninterested in listening, closed to temperate persuasion, because they are looking for followers and likes, even in person.

What a great observation. Most everybody who comments in my comments section uses a handle, and that’s fine with me. Given how dangerous it can be to state your actual opinion in public, even if it’s an anodyne one, I don’t blame people for wanting to hide behind fake names. Still, I wonder how our dialogues here would go if people had to say the things they say here face to face. I know for a fact that I would state things differently, or not at all, because when I’m actually with people, I don’t want to do much more than have a drink and a laugh. Partly because of the way I was raised (Southerners are taught to do whatever is necessary to put your guests at ease), and partly because personal conflict exhausts me, I’m a different person in real life than I am on this blog. I say things here that I wouldn’t say to people’s faces, and I’ve gotten much more like that, in part because of having to deal with all the extreme nastiness over the years (i.e., I don’t want to talk about controversial things in conversation with strangers, because dealing with anonymous people in comments sections and on social media makes one EXTREMELY guarded, for reasons Scott Alexander eloquently illuminates).

It’s always a balancing act, having to toggle between being honest in offering my opinions and thoughtful in remembering that actual human beings read those opinions, so I should resist the temptation to be a bloggy version of Addison DeWitt . Anyway, I’ve said enough.

UPDATE: Ah, the moment after I posted this, I checked my e-mail, and a reader had sent in this Verge piece about “the secret life of Facebook moderators”. Here’s how it starts:

The panic attacks started after Chloe watched a man die. She spent the past three and a half weeks in training, trying to harden herself against the daily onslaught of disturbing posts: the hate speech, the violent attacks, the graphic pornography. In a few more days, she will become a full-time Facebook content moderator, or what the company she works for, a professional services vendor named Cognizant, opaquely calls a “process executive.” For this portion of her education, Chloe will have to moderate a Facebook post in front of her fellow trainees. When it’s her turn, she walks to the front of the room, where a monitor displays a video that has been posted to the world’s largest social network. None of the trainees have seen it before, Chloe included. She presses play. The video depicts a man being murdered. Someone is stabbing him, dozens of times, while he screams and begs for his life. Chloe’s job is to tell the room whether this post should be removed. She knows that section 13 of the Facebook community standards prohibits videos that depict the murder of one or more people. When Chloe explains this to the class, she hears her voice shaking. Returning to her seat, Chloe feels an overpowering urge to sob. Another trainee has gone up to review the next post, but Chloe cannot concentrate. She leaves the room, and begins to cry so hard that she has trouble breathing. No one tries to comfort her. This is the job she was hired to do. And for the 1,000 people like Chloe moderating content for Facebook at the Phoenix site, and for 15,000 content reviewers around the world, today is just another day at the office.

My God, this piece. The conditions that the Facebook moderators have to work under, and the impossibility of getting it right all the time, given the ever-changing rules. And having to live with the things you see on Facebook daily. More:

But over time, he grew concerned for his mental health. “We were doing something that was darkening our soul — or whatever you call it,” he says. “What else do you do at that point? The one thing that makes us laugh is actually damaging us. I had to watch myself when I was joking around in public. I would accidentally say [offensive] things all the time — and then be like, Oh shit, I’m at the grocery store. I cannot be talking like this.” Jokes about self-harm were also common. “Drinking to forget,” Sara heard a coworker once say, when the counselor asked him how he was doing. (The counselor did not invite the employee in for further discussion.) On bad days, Sara says, people would talk about it being “time to go hang out on the roof” — the joke being that Cognizant employees might one day throw themselves off it. One day, Sara said, moderators looked up from their computers to see a man standing on top of the office building next door. Most of them had watched hundreds of suicides that began just this way. The moderators got up and hurried to the windows. The man didn’t jump, though. Eventually everyone realized that he was a fellow employee, taking a break.

Read it all.

The poor soul who flagged my TAC piece about Jussie Smollett’s hate hoax was probably just applying the Facebook community standard that says you can’t question a hate crime. It’s a stupid standard, especially in the case of someone like Smollett, who, by the time I posted that, had been exposed as a likely hoaxer (though he had not yet been charged). The FB censor should have let my comment through, but I can see why he or she made the call they did, out of fear that I might have legitimately broken the community standard rule. That person might have been fired. As Scott Alexander said, “They’re just afraid. Everyone is afraid.”

I was right to complain about FB’s banning my post. But I wonder now if some badly paid SOB working under harsh conditions lost his job because of it.

UPDATE: I really appreciate the kind compliments from you readers."

Cort Kirkwood'],https://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/84e86639943d00e2b2d7a60dc8f81908_XL.jpg,"['cousin', 'white', 'program', 'daniels', 'inspired', 'directors', 'attack', 'post', 'think', 'lee', 'need', 'tmz', 'smollett', 'homosexual', 'empire', 'video']","Jussie Smollett, the homosexual actor who falsely claimed, police allege, that two Trump supporters attacked him on January 29, might have gotten the idea from a prominent black director’s claim about a cousin who suffered a “homophobic” attack.

TMZ.com reported that Smollett likely saw an Instagram post from Oscar-winning director Lee Daniels, who helped create and directs Empire, the program that made Smollett a star.

If true, the case is solved. All that remains is a guilty plea from Smollett, or a guilty verdict after trial. Smollett is charged with felony disturbing the peace in connection with fabricating the widely believed yet preposterous tale.

Police have said Smollett staged the attack because, at $65,000 to $100,000 per episode of the Fox program, he didn’t think he was paid enough. Now, apparently, we know where he got the idea.

TMZ Report

“Jussie Smollett might have gotten the idea to stage his own attack after Lee Daniels talked about his cousin getting assaulted because he’s gay ... at least that’s what some members of the ‘Empire’ cast think,” TMZ reported.

Those sources told the Internet scandal sheet that “some cast members think Jussie’s gears started grinding in his head days after Lee posted a video on Instagram on January 10 calling out homophobia.”

“This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories,” Daniels wrote. “It’s the beginning of a new year and we need to do better. We need to continue to remember to love and to turn against the hate that we’re seeing out there.”

Daniels continued:

We all need to fight that fight together. For all the people who are hurting, who are struggling, and who are trying to find some meaning in this life, I am here to say if you need a safe place or a ear to listen, then I’m here. I’m listening to what you’re saying and what you’re going through. I am standing up for you and will continue to fight for you. This is my mission and message to you for the beginning of 2019.

After that post, Lee told the story on Empire’s set. “The sources now say this might have been where Jussie got the idea to take matters into his own hands ... and become an LGBT hero,” TMZ reported.

Too Good To Be True

But Smollett isn’t a hero. His story was, like so many other hoaxes, just too good to be true.

Smollett claimed that two white men wearing MAGA hats beat him up and tied a noose around his neck as he returned from Subway at 2 a.m. “This is MAGA country,” they improbably said. That happened a week after Smollett received a letter containing a threat in the cut-out letters of a ransom note.

But the two white men were really two Nigerian brothers to whom Smollett paid $3,500 with a check, police allege. Police have the check in their possession and video that shows the brothers purchasing supplies to perpetrate the hoax.

Police said Smollett staged the attack, now the subject of a hilarious video produced by Comedy Central’s Daily Show, because he wanted a pay raise.

Thus does the angle involving Lee Daniels’ instagram post come into play. “Interesting,” TMZ observed, “because Lee Daniels is the guy in charge of the cash register.”

Smollett’s character will not appear in the final two episodes of the program, but even worse, he could land in prison for three years if convicted.

As well, he might face federal mail-fraud charges for sending the letter, a felony that carries a 10-year prison sentence.

This isn’t Smollett’s first time lying to police. In 2007, he pleaded guilty to “providing false information to law enforcement.”

Another Hoax

Smollett’s isn’t the only hoax of late, just the most famous, along with that of “Native American elder” Nathan Phillips, who peddled lies about his encounter with white, Catholic high-school students at the Lincoln Memorial.

The Detroit News reported this morning that a local “transgender” activist, Nikki Joly — a woman who pretends she is man — is accused of burning down her own home, an arson that killed five pets, because she was dissatisfied that her cause was not receiving the publicity it should.

In December, cops busted hate hoaxers at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, and Goucher College in Baltimore, Maryland.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told “Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts on Feb. 25 that police followed the evidence in the case and treated Smollett, 36, as the victim until two key witnesses, the Nigerian-American brothers that Smollett allegedly hired to stage the attack, revealed the plan to detectives.

“It’s not the Chicago police saying [the attack was staged], it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying it,” Johnson told Roberts, reported Fox News. “We worked very closely with their lawyer.”

Before the brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, confessed, detectives gathered lots of evidence that seemed to indicate that the alleged attack was actually a hoax.

The huge piece of evidence connecting Smollett to the attack was a $3,500 check that the actor wrote to the brothers about a week before the Jan. 29 incident.

Smollett’s team has tried to point to the check ostensibly being for training services the brothers rendered Smollett but Johnson said that’s just not true.

Johnson said that there’s more evidence that has not yet been made public.

“[Smollett] still has a presumption of innocence and he still has his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route,” Johnson said. “There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that doesn’t support the version that he gave us. There’s still a lot of video evidence, physical evidence, and testimony that doesn’t support what he said happened.”

Johnson told reporters at a press briefing on Feb. 21, hours after Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report, that the actor was dissatisfied with his salary.

“Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Johnson said. “I’m left hanging my head and asking why.”

“Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim,” Johnson added. “I’m offended by what’s happened and I’m also angry. This publicity stunt is a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and certainly didn’t deserve.”

Smollett originally claimed he was attacked in Chicago around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29, in freezing temperatures by two white men who shouted slurs at him and said “this is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make American Great Again.”

In mid-February, the Osundairos were arrested on suspicion of attacking Smollett. After being held for nearly two days, they revealed the plan to detectives, police said.

Johnson said that the brothers knocked Smollett around a bit but that the actor is suspected of giving himself some injuries.

“They punched him a little but as far as we can tell, the scratches and bruises on his face were likely self-inflicted,” Johnson said.

At the briefing, Chicago Police Commander Edward Wodnicki indicated some of the additional evidence in the case. “While we were waiting for them to return we executed over 50 search warrants and subpoenas … phone records, social media records, and records on individuals to help us illuminate the likely facts that occurred in this event,” he said, noting that police had to wait for the Osundairos to return from Nigeria, where they flew later on Jan. 29.

Johnson said that detectives found evidence that not only was Smollett behind the fake attack, but he was also behind a letter containing threats that was sent to him on the “Empire” set, which is also in Chicago. The letter investigation is being handled by the FBI and U.S. Postal Service."

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was a guest on Monday’s “Morning Joe,” but the hosts did not ask Emanuel about Smollett. Oddly, co-host Mika Brzezinski teased the segment by noting that Emanuel would discuss the case – but then the moment never came.

MSNBC'S AVOIDANCE OF JUSSIE SMOLLETT STORY DURING PRIMETIME 'A POLITICALLY BIASED JOURNALISTIC CHOICE,’ EXPERT SAYS

""Still ahead, Chicago police blasted Empire actor Jussie Smollett last week, accusing him of staging a hate crime because he was unhappy with his salary,” she said. “We'll get Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's reaction to the alleged incident, next on ‘Morning Joe.’""

After a commercial break, Emanuel discussed the fact that Mexico isn’t paying for a wall along the southern border, the 2020 Democratic field and various things that he accomplished during his time as mayor of Chicago. Smollett was never touched on while Emanuel conversed with the “Morning Joe” co-hosts.

Media Research Center contributing editor Mark Finkelstein asked, “What happened during the commercial break between Mika's tease and the interview itself? Did Emanuel, in his tough-guy persona, perhaps inform the hosts that he would accept no questions about Smollett?”

CNN’S VAN JONES COMPARES JUSSIE SMOLLETT TO JACKIE ROBINSON: ‘THIS IS THE FALL OF AN ICON’

Finkelstein rapped the morning shows hosts, noting that if Emanuel didn’t want to talk about the alleged hate crime hoax then they should have either “let Rahm explain live on the air his refusal to answer” or canceled the interview altogether.

“Instead, Joe and Mika did neither,” Finkelstein wrote. “Had they bowed meekly to Emanuel's demand?”

Finkelstein noted that the panel included other guests, such as MSNBC correspondent Kasie Hunt and New York Times reporter Nick Confessore but nobody asked Emanuel about Smollett.

“Looks like the fix was in,” Finkelstein wrote.

MSNBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

MSNBC GUEST UNCHECKED AFTER FLOATING THEORY THAT TRUMP-SUPPORTING COPS MAY HAVE FRAMED JUSSIE SMOLLETT

Last week, MSNBC was slammed for ignoring the Smollett story during primetime. When the liberal network covered the story during the day, it allowed a guest to float the theory that pro-Trump police officers could be lying about the details.

Smollett was charged Wednesday with felony disorderly conduct amid allegations of filing a false police report. He turned himself in at central booking early Thursday. If convicted, he is facing up to three years in prison. A judge set Smollett's bond for $100,000 on Thursday.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has blasted the “Empire” actor throughout the process and reiterated on Monday that evidence points to the alleged attack being a hoax.

""It's not the Chicago police saying [the attack was staged], it's the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying it,” Johnson said Monday on “Good Morning America.”

CHICAGO POLICE SAY THEY HAVE MORE EVIDENCE JUSSIE SMOLLETT STAGED HATE CRIME

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and openly gay, said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" — before fleeing.

It was after the police spoke with brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo that they pivoted their investigation away from a hate crime and to an allegedly false police report.

Johnson, who spoke passionately about Smollett last week, told Robin Roberts that it was his job as police superintendent to ""ensure that the record gets set straight.""

Johnson spoke at length about the ""damage"" he says Smollett did to the city of Chicago and to legitimate victims of racially motivated hate crimes.

Admitting that Chicago and its police department has its own ""issues with racism and excessive force,"" Johnson argued, ""We didn't earn this particular incident.""

""I just want people to understand that's a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department,"" he continued.

""I just hope people don't judge other folks that are victims of these types of crimes because this is just one particular incident. That's the damaging part of it. You damage the city's reputation. We don't need any help with that; we really don't.""

Johnson, who said he grew up in the notorious Chicago Cabrini-Green housing project in the ""tail end of the civil rights era,"" said he took the alleged hoax personally.

""The symbolism of a noose is very offensive,"" he said.

""First and foremost, there are real victims of...hate crimes. And I just hope that people don't treat them with skepticism. This is one particular incident and it has to stand on its own merits.""

What's more is that Johnson said the police department has ""a lot more evidence that hasn't teen presented yet that doesn't support [Smollett's] version that he gave us.""

""There's still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply doesn't support his version of what happened,"" he said Monday morning.

Smollett, who Johnson said ""still has the presumption of innocence,"" was released on $100,000 bail following his court appearance last Thursday after his arrest for disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.

Johnson said that Chicago police treated Smollett like a victim until they brought in the Osundairo brothers for questioning and they admitted in the 47th hour of holding that Smollett paid them to carry out the hoax, which was staged to look like a hate crime. Police can legally keep people of interest for just 48 hours without charging them until they must be released.

""We have to maintain the integrity of the investigation, and that's what we did,"" Johnson explained. ""We did not have the facts that support him being involved in it until that 47th hour. It's important for people to recognize, it's not the Chicago police saying he did this — it's the evidence, the facts and the witnesses saying he did this. It's our job to investigate it and bring the evidence and facts to the state.""

Despite TMZ's report that the sources said the $3,500 check Smollett issued the Osundairo brothers was for personal training purposes, Johnson maintained in his interview Monday that the check was to ""carry out this incident.""

Smollett has denied the claims that he played a role in carrying out the alleged attack as a hoax. Chicago police said they believe Smollett's motive was to get attention, as he was allegedly unhappy with his Empire salary.

FOX announced last week that it dropped Smollett from the cast following the charges against him."

Unrelenting winds tearing across the eastern US have created a rare 'ice tsunami' in upstate New York.

A powerful windstorm Sunday broke an ice boom in Lake Erie and allowed the blocks of ice, which were floating on the water at the mouth of the Niagara River, to spill over a retaining wall and onto the shore and the roadway above.

High winds howled through much of the nation's eastern half for a second day Monday, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, closing schools, and pushing dramatic mountains of ice onto the shores of Lake Erie.

Wind gusts of hurricane force - 74 mph (119 kph) - or higher were reported around the region, including West Virginia and New York. A motorist in Sandusky, Ohio, captured video of a tractor-trailer flipping over on a bridge .

Toppled trees and power poles, easy targets for strong winds that uprooted them from ground saturated by rain and snowmelt, plunged homes and businesses into darkness, though in most places power was expected back quickly as winds died down by the end of Monday. Hundreds of schools were delayed or canceled in New York alone.

The wind peeled off roofs in places. In Syracuse, New York, scaffolding blown off a building knocked down power lines.

Wind advisories and warnings were in effect through Monday in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast up to northern New England.

Giant chunks of ice spilled over the banks of the Niagara River across from Buffalo on Sunday, creating a jagged, frosty barrier known as an 'ice tsunami' between the river and a scenic road.

Ice tsunamis, formally known as an 'ice shoves', occur when strong gusts of wind blow chunks of ice off a body of water and they accumulate on land, tearing down anything in their path.

One man who stopped to photograph the strange sight wrote on Twitter: 'This ice tsunami is one of the craziest things I've ever witnessed. Starting to bulldoze trees and street lamps.'

The Niagara Parks Police Service shared a video of the ice tsunami on Sunday and warned anyone in the area to drive carefully.

'We've never had the ice pushed up against the walls and right up onto our patios. It's in my patio, the neighbor's patio, and the patio after that.'

Hamburg emergency crews have been going door to door to check on residents of the 88 properties affected by the voluntary evacuation.

The National Weather Service in Buffalo has issued a wind advisory in effect until Monday night, warning that winds could reach up to 75 mph.

'Strong wind gusts will bring down trees and power lines and result in numerous power outages,' the agency said. 'Minor property damage is also possible, especially to roofs and siding. Travel in high profile vehicles will be very difficult at times.'

In an appearance on MSNBC, the Washington Post’s Jonathan Capehart blamed President Trump. He said that Trump “actually stokes the atmosphere of menace and insecurity that millions of Americans feel across this country.”





He added that Trump and his supporters “are using the Jussie Smollett situation to rhetorically bash people who are afraid for their own existence and their own lives,” which he called “really despicable.”

From the Saturday AM Joy on MSNBC, after a clip of Trump on January 31, calling the alleged attack “horrible”:

“The reason why so many people were so quick to believe Jussie Smollett and what he said and his version of events before they all unraveled was because that man [Trump] who you just played feeds into and actually stokes the atmosphere of menace and insecurity that millions of Americans feel across this country, whether they are people of color, LGBTQ, trans people, immigrants, Dreamers. You just go down the list.

“There are people in this country who every day feel that their very existence – their own security is at stake. And so, you know, the president’s Super-PAC, right-wingers, far right conservatives who are using the Jussie Smollett situation to rhetorically bash people who are afraid for their own existence and their own lives, you know, is really despicable.”

Media Research Center Vice President of Research Brent Baker explains our weekly pick: “Not much self-reflection from Capehart, who’s more interested in blaming his own biased perception of his political opponents for his own gullibility than examining why he feels so victimized by those on the right. Buying into Smollett’s story, which had many red flags, was bad enough. """

His arrest followed weeks of growing national attention to what initially appeared to be a hate crime committed against the actor.

How Smollett’s accusation unraveled has drawn intense scrutiny, but what has been overlooked to some degree is the role that police technology played in figuring out exactly what happened between the time a threatening letter containing a suspicious white powder was sent on Jan. 22 to Smollett, followed by his alleged attack several days later and when police detectives took Smollett into custody for filing a false police report.

A week after the Chicago Police Department (CPD) confirmed Smollett had received a threatening letter, the actor, who is black and gay, reported to police he had been assaulted by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him. The attack took place Jan. 29 in Chicago’s upscale neighborhood known as Streeterville. The attackers wore dark clothes, ski masks and, at one point, according to Smollett, they put a rope around his neck.

Chicago has one of the most extensive surveillance camera systems in the country — police and private-sector cameras — that allow CPD detectives to capture the evidence they need to fight crime. The cameras are part of CPD’s aggressive effort to use tech and data to reduce crime in the city. Besides tens of thousands of cameras, the police have deployed gunshot detection platforms, predictive mapping and data analytics to track and deter crimes.

In the Smollett case, detectives viewed video evidence and traced the movements of the suspects involved in the attack on Jan. 29, including footage of them getting into a cab, said Jonathan H. Lewin, chief of CPD’s Bureau of Technical Services, in an email. “Video from inside the vehicle, along with a series of public and private cameras on the North side of the city, allowed investigators to track the subject’s movement backwards to where they came from prior to the attack, which ultimately led to their identification,” he said.

To isolate video segments relevant to the Smollett case, police detectives used advanced video analytics tools, such as BriefCam, to quickly search through video segments from hundreds of cameras, according to Lewin.

“A new high-tech analytics center, located in Detective Area South, combines video analytics and other capabilities to allow state-of-the-art investigative techniques to be applied to a wide range of digital evidence,” said Lewin. “These processes and systems complement Chicago’s Strategic Decision Support Centers, which are high-tech nerve centers deployed in 20 of our 22 districts.”

The support centers have had a significant impact in some of Chicago’s more crime-ridden neighborhoods. By blending the latest in police technology with human expertise and knowledge, CPD has been able to reduce crime, especially violent crime in some of the hardest hit neighborhoods. As the Smollett case demonstrated, the ability of CPD to act quickly as a crime is unfolding has received significant support from technology.

While the police had no video evidence of the actual attack, the efforts of the investigators, using the tools outlined by Lewin, led them to the individuals suspected of attacking Smollett. When the two men were interviewed by CPD detectives, a different story about the alleged assault began to emerge. On Feb. 16, the police released a statement, “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Four days later, the case involving the actor quickly unraveled. Smollett, once thought to be a victim of a serious hate crime, had become the suspect in an elaborate hoax meant to boost his fame and fortune as an actor. On Feb. 21, Smollett turned himself in to the police. The next day, producers of the hit series “Empire” announced they will remove Smollett’s character from the final two episodes in the show’s current season."

Roberts got a do-over on Monday as she interviewed Chicago’s superintendent of police, Eddie Johnson.

At times, Roberts seemed tougher on Johnson than Smollett, demanding details and offering follow-ups. But first, the host tried to rewrite history and pretend she saw problems from the start: “Even though you were saying early on that there was no reason not to believe his story, there were a lot of red flags that a lot of people saw and you all had questions.”

As a refresher, Roberts on February 14 interviewed Smollet, offering little skepticism:

What do you say to a young gay man, a young gay person? ... If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal? ... It's been two weeks since that night left actor Jussie Smollett bruised but not broken. And he's still processing the raw emotions. Have you ever been threatened before?

To restate, she never once even called the claims “alleged.” (As the MRC’s Tim Graham noted, the GMA co-host was tougher in fictional form when she interviewed Smollett’s character on his show Empire.) Days later, as the allegations continued to unravel, ABC defended the softball interview.

On Monday, Roberts demanded details and offered follow-up questions to Superintendent Johnson. Here, she wanted certainty in how/why the two men allegedly involved in plotting the hoax were paid:

ROBIN ROBERTS: The check that we saw in Eva Pilgrim's report. The $3500. Did the brothers specifically say that was for the attack? CHICAGO SUPERINTENDENT EDDIE JOHNSON: They said that he paid them $3500 with a check. ROBERTS: But did they say what it was for? JOHNSON: Yeah. To carry out this incident.

Days after Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson came out strong against the Empire star, who has been charged with filing a false police report, in a post-arrest press conference, Johnson went on Good Morning America to further speak on the high-profile investigation.

Speaking to Robin Roberts, who conducted the first post-attack interview with Smollett, the superintendent said the investigation is ongoing and that the actor has the presumption of innocence, but that there’s still more to come to light.

“There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that does not support the version that he gave us,” shared Johnson. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence, and testimony that just simply doesn’t support his version of what happened.”

And while TMZ reported that the $3,500 check from Smollett to brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo was for a workout and nutrition plan, Johnson says they told police that the money was for staging the attack.

Confusion and volatile emotions erupted immediately after Smollett’s highly publicized arrest Thursday at Chicago police headquarters. According to TMZ, Howard was so infuriated that he refused to come onto the set to shoot scenes and remained in his trailer for the balance of the day.

Howard was reportedly one of the ones who doubted Smollett’s testimony from the outset. And as the investigation progressed to the point where the finger began to be pointed in Smollett’s direction, Howard confronted him with questions about the circumstances of the alleged beatdown and the timeline.

Empire’s production publicly backed Jussie Smollett throughout his hate crime scandal, until recently. When the actor became the suspect of a felony crime for allegedly filing a false police report, the mood changed with the production staff.

As rolling out reported, Smollett was dismissed from “Empire’s” final two shows on Friday, February 22, after he turned himself in. The actor will not take part in the last two episodes of this season. His departure, producers stated, would “avoid any further disruptions on set.”

TMZ reported that Howard screamed at Smollett, 36, in a way to urge the actor, who plays Jamal Lyon, to come clean. The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairom, gave testimonies to a grand jury that served to corroborate Howard’s initial feelings. Afterward, Smollett addressed the crew to apologize about the scandal while still maintaining his innocence. But Howard was a conspicuous no-show. There were others on the set who quietly harbored the same sentiments as Howard.

The tension became too thick to keep Smollett around for the immediate future.

Later, Howard showed support for Smollett via social media on Saturday by showing the embattled actor playing with Howard’s child in his trailer. He also informed Smollett on the post that the entire cast and crew were in his corner."

Long before the Jussie Smollett and Covington Catholic outrages were outed as hoaxes, the trend of exposing alleged hate crimes as frauds was in full swing.

Here at The College Fix, we’ve chronicled more than 50 campus-related hate-crime hoaxes over the last seven years, for example. That’s just the tip of the iceberg.

A new book by Wilfred Reilly, an associate professor of political science at Kentucky State University, details 409 confirmed hate hoaxes. In “Hate Crime Hoax: How the Left is Selling a Fake Race War,” Reilly highlights in particular more than 100 “widely publicized incidents of so-called hate crimes that never actually happened.”

The question of why someone would pretend to be the victim of heinous and vile acts perpetrated under the guise of racism and bigotry is now under serious consideration.

The answer is complex and multifaceted. Here are four motivations most agree on.

Victims are celebrated martyrs

If you want to go from zero to hero in a flash, become the victim of a hate crime. Today’s society worships victimhood. For the last several years, two sociologists have chronicled the phenomenon of how being a victim has become a badge of honor. “Victims” are given prominence, popularity, attention, accolades. They are celebrated as heroic and courageous for standing strong against adversity. It’s no wonder people have a strong desire to become a “victim,” it promises instant gratification and celebrity status.

It advances a narrative

The constant drumbeat from the Left is that America is a racist, bigoted nation. That it suffers from white privilege and institutional oppression. That many of its citizens (like the ones who voted for Donald Trump) are deeply racist and filled with hate. To try to prove it, the Left engages in faux hate crimes, so they can say, “See, I told you so.” Certainly real hate crimes do occur, but at this point they’re lost in the haze of this hate-crime hoax trend sweeping the nation. Professor Reilly, in an interview with Fox News, pointed out that “virtually all of the high-profile, widely reported hate crimes over the past two to three years have been hoaxes.” The scholar added that the phenomenon is primarily coming from the Left. The subhead of his book is “How the Left is Selling a Fake Race War.” It seems fitting. As sociologist Jason Manning has pointed out, the Left has weaponized their self-perceived plight in order to force conservatives into bowing to their worldview.

It’s done for gain

The truth is — hate-crime hoaxes can pay. Reilly pointed out that in some examples it’s an insurance distribution. He cited an owner of an LGBTQ bar who burned it to the ground for a payout. Sometimes there’s personal gain involved. Students have asked for venmo support in the wake of alleged hate-crimes that have engulfed campuses with moral indignation. Lawsuits and scholarships are other avenues. Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter enjoyed $100 million in its coffers, despite the fact that “hands up, don’t shoot” was thoroughly debunked. And the Southern Poverty Law Center’s endowment stands at $432.7 million. Keep in mind this is the same group that omitted 2,000 post-election anti-white hate crimes.

It gives “victims” meaning

The Left is obsessed with identity politics. It gives them meaning like a religion. It’s been saidthat “the hunger for identity is what fuels the mob-ready grievance culture.” A hate-crime (hoax) against a person is almost like a religious experience. They have reached the promised land. All that talk of oppression, hatred, racism — it’s vindicated and validated. They are a Victim, capital V. They join a special circle of people. They can talk about it, blog about it, bemoan it on social media. As sociologists following this victim-as-hero trend have stated: “aggrieved parties are especially likely to highlight their identity as victims, emphasizing their own suffering and innocence. Their adversaries are privileged and blameworthy, but they themselves are pitiable and blameless.”"

Simply this: A culture that rewards victimhood status will produce an ever-growing number of victims.

It’s basic economics, really: You get more of what you subsidize and less of what you tax.

Smollett was indicted Wednesday and arrested and arraigned Thursday on a felony charge of filing a false police report.

The successful actor, who is black and gay, had claimed he was attacked by two white men who yelled racial and homophobic epithets, hung a noose around his neck, and poured a liquid on him that he said he thought was bleach.

His attackers, Smollett said, also shouted, “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Police located two brothers from Nigeria who say the actor paid them to carry out the staged attack. Police said Smollett’s motive was that he thought he wasn’t being paid enough for his role in the hit TV show “Empire.”

Smollett denies this version of events and is entitled, like all Americans, to the presumption of innocence.

A claim of an attack such as this, if false, is doubly troubling. Not only does it mean a waste of police resources, but it makes real claims harder to believe.

Unfortunately, it is no longer outrageous to believe that even someone rich and famous would file a false report of this sort. Today, victimhood is confused with virtue and has become a status symbol. What sociologists Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning call “victimhood culture” is becoming hardwired into everyday America.

Under this regime, Campbell and Manning write, victimization becomes “a way of attracting sympathy, so rather than emphasize either their strength or inner worth, the aggrieved emphasize their oppression and social marginalization … People increasingly demand help from others, and advertise their oppression as evidence that they deserve respect and assistance.”

Assistance in this case may mean actual benefits, such as easier admission to a university because of victimhood status.

But it’s not just potential rewards that make the number of people claiming victimhood status multiply. The way failure is interpreted under victimhood culture also tips the balance toward an ever growing number of victims in society.

For decades now, leftist activists have fought to ascribe lack of success to “structural discrimination” rather than lack of individual effort.

In an extensive, Ford Foundation-funded study on Mexican-Americans published in 1970, UCLA researchers were baffled and frustrated that their subjects interpreted their reversals as setbacks that were remediable through individual action and felt no need for group mobilization.

The lived experience of this group, they wrote, had produced “a long and bitter controversy among middle-class Mexican-Americans about defining the ethnic group as disadvantaged by any other criterion than individual failures.”

This was the time when the foundations of victimhood culture were first being laid, and activists understood that resentment was a powerful bonding agent. They therefore had to convince a proud people who had been in the Southwest for generations that they were and would always be targets of invidious, racially-based discrimination unless they mobilized as a group.

This was a task made all the harder, however, by the fact that, according to the UCLA researchers, even among those Mexican-Americans who had experienced discrimination, “quite a few … fail to generalize their resentment about it, but continue to particularize incidents.”

Decades later, Campbell and Manning describe the problem this way:

The moral status conferred by victimhood is evident in how social scientists describe and explain those they view as victims, leading them to engage in a kind of ‘blame analysis’ in which they reject any theories that ‘blame’ designated victims by attributing to them any causal role in their predicament.

Campbell and Manning write that today’s grievance culture emerges in societies, like today’s, which lack ethnic homogeneity. But that may be putting the cart before the horse.

Perhaps the national sense that “we’re all in this together” breaks down when we relentlessly instill a consciousness of ethnic-based grievances; when we construct identity groups on the idea that they have no individual agency.

There is no glee to be had by any political side in the Jussie Smollett affair.

If the police charges turn out to be true, we can at least learn something from this sorry affair. A culture that rewards victimhood produces ever more self-proclaimed victims, and ever fewer individuals willing to try to overcome adversity through individual effort."

He added, “But there’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

Johnson wanted to make it clear that the Chicago Police Department is not coming out against Smollett. Instead, he said the evidence, facts and witnesses are saying Smollett created a fake hate crime.

“It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago Police saying he did something,” he argued. “It’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this.”

Rep. Fisher, allow a vote on factory farm moratorium

I was at the State Capitol last week to support a bill that would put a moratorium on new or expanding factory farms and what I learned was shameful. Rep. Dean Fisher is single-handedly blocking this bill.

Thousands of Iowans are calling for a moratorium on new or expanding factory farms. Twenty-five counties have passed resolutions calling for a moratorium, local control or stronger permitting standards for factory farms. Iowans across the state are ready for discussion and debate on this bill.

In spite of this, Fisher is refusing to assign House File 203 to a subcommittee. What is he afraid of? Why won’t he let the democratic process work?

Republicans just continue to hurt public schools

The Republicans apparently will not be satisfied until they have completely destroyed public schools in Iowa. The latest bill would let schools eliminate both nurses and librarians, and is just another way for districts to cut costs instead of properly funding schools [Your school wouldn't have to hire a nurse or librarian under this Iowa bill].

School nurses are often the ""family physicians"" for students in poverty. Screenings help determine deficits which might impede students' success. Honestly, who believes that parents are comfortable dealing with the Department of Public Health directly?

And no teacher-librarians? Actually, they are media specialists now, and they do a fantastic job of educating students and their teachers how to negotiate the ever-expanding internet. Without guidance, students won't know how to verify information nor how to do an effective search.

For Republican legislators to declare they know education just because they went to school is ridiculous. Standards and expectations are important for our children to be ready for the future.

Will change in court give the GOP another avenue to push legislation?

However, after reading Martin Cannon’s recent guest column, I’m left wondering if someone is forcing women to get abortions [The Iowa Supreme Court has abused its power in abortion rulings].

His heartfelt opposition is obvious, however, to say the Iowa Supreme Court has ignored the majority of Iowans is a bit misleading. The court ruled on laws that were passed by a political party that holds power presently in Des Moines. Now, that party wants to change the rules about the court’s makeup.

If a constitutional amendment doesn’t pass a general election, will the party in power be satisfied, or will they have another avenue to pursue this legislation?

Infrastructure plans should include broadband

As Congress considers an infrastructure package, it is critical that Iowans in Congress keep the information-technology (IT) industry’s needs in mind. This month, I was in Washington D.C., for an event organized by CompTIA, which advocates on behalf of the technology community.

We support policies that improve broadband competition by encouraging and removing barriers to the deployment of high-speed broadband networks. We promote policies to wire more American communities and increase broadband adoption and advocate for policies to make more spectrum available for both licensed and unlicensed use.

Specifically, we advocate for implementing incentives to encourage government spectrum users to share, sell or lease their spectrum.

The bottom line is that any modern infrastructure should focus on improving and expanding broadband connectivity, using smart technologies to enhance public utilities, promoting cyber-solutions to secure the nation’s energy grid, and supporting smart transportation solutions to maximize efficiency and safety of our roads, bridges, railways and airports.

Congress should work to create an infrastructure funding package that supports core emerging technologies that will help to build, secure, and advance our communities.

Grassley blocked Medicare drug-price negotiations

Apparently he has forgotten, or perhaps just didn’t mention, that he helped bar Medicare (the largest purchaser of drugs in America) from negotiating discounts with Big Pharma. Also, he has done nothing to change that since he authored Part D of the Medicare Modernization Act, which passed in 2003.

So, for 16 years, Medicare enrollees have suffered from having to pay higher prices for drugs than anyone else in the world, while Grassley has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry in campaign contributions.

Cutting school nurses causes harm to students

I do not understand the logic behind the proposed bill for not having nurses in schools [Your school wouldn't have to hire a nurse or librarian under this Iowa bill]. This will certainly be a disservice to the children.

If there are injuries during school time, who will handle it? Who will give the children the medication they need during school hours? Who will do vision screening, lead-level screening, etc? The originators of the bill may say that it will be up to the parents.

As we well know, many parents do not even take their children to the doctor, let alone get vision and lead screening done.

If some parents will not even feed their children, why is it assumed they will do the required testing? I hope legislators think this over very carefully before voting on it.

We need a reality check when it comes to licensure

I am disappointed by the Register editorial about proposed legislation to include art therapists as licensed professionals in Iowa [Don't add government red tape by licensing art therapists].

Many of us are tired of competing with people who call themselves art therapists after attending a few weekend courses. My master's degree took me two years, and my certification as registered and board-certified art therapist took thousands of hours of supervision that I paid to receive. However, I was still not eligible to receive payments from insurance companies or be eligible for some kinds of malpractice insurance unless I took more classes and a licensure exam to become an LMHC.

Now I spend money to attend continuing education workshops to keep my license and additional money to attend workshops to keep my art therapy certifications. Would you deny an orthopedic surgeon licensure because he is also doctor?

Talk to registered and board-certified art therapists. I think you will hear that state licensure will save them money they now pay by having to meet two CEU requirements.

Vote 'yes' Tuesday on the 1-cent sales tax

West Des Moines residents who live in Polk County have an important decision to make when they step into the voting booth March 5. They’ll decide whether they support a 1-cent sales and service tax increase or not.

There’s a lot at stake. A ""yes"" vote means the city can hire seven new police officers and five new firefighters. Both are needed in order to keep pace with growth of the city. A ""yes vote results in property tax reduction. Half of the $7 million raised each year will be used to lower property taxes. A ""yes"" vote means moving forward with public infrastructure improvements for flood control projects, traffic flow and transportation improvements, the five waters project and a major public library refurbishment. A ""yes"" vote also means more green space and an outdoor amphitheater.

Each of these items are part of future plans for the city, but it could take years before we are able to accomplish them without the passage of the local-option sales and service tax.

As a lifetime West Des Moines resident, longtime member of the West Des Moines Parks and Recreation Board, and other volunteer boards, commissions and committees over the years, I support a 1-cent sales tax increase from 6 to 7 cents.

Iowans in 97 of the state’s 99 counties have passed a one-cent sales tax increase and are benefiting from the extra revenue. We all need to get with the program.

I’m not one to just dream about someday. I believe in taking action now and I’m asking my fellow residents to join me in voting ""yes"" March 5.

Strange that they were not that forceful with President Obama. This president is at least opening negotiations. How about the fact that there have been no missile attacks for two years?

Trump has done so many positive things, but all the media cares about is the negative or what they can do to impeach him. Does the president get credit for anything that he has done — like a great economy, low unemployment and tax reform?

The judicial problem simply doesn't exist

Our governor and some legislators believe the judicial selection system that has served our state so well for nearly 60 years is somehow broken and in need of a fix.

Iowan may want to return vote for current legislators

Abortion, guns and judges. It seems that the Iowa Legislature is stuck in a bad remake of the movie ""Groundhog Day."" Or maybe they’re just affirming Einstein’s definition of insanity?

Either way, the issues they actually have dealt with have been tepid at best: A paltry increase in education funding, little or no progress on mental health and virtually no movement on health care.

Does the Legislature have a plan to deal with Iowa’s crumbling infrastructure? How about preparations for flooding when all this snow melts? Tax reform that benefits everyone and not just the wealthy? Are legislators paying their fair share of their health insurance benefit? The obvious answer is no.

They continue to spin their wheels on issues that pander to the few and are politically advantageous to their own interests. There are a myriad of other issues which are ignored while legislators deal with the pressing problems of speed cameras and fireworks. If I buy a product that turns out to be defective, I can return it and get my money back.

In the case of the Iowa Legislature, I cannot even get my vote back and it would seem as though their customer service department is closed.

Would Iowans still love Iowa with this winter weather?

As I unfolded the Register recently, I was bewildered by the headline [Iowa Poll: There’s no place like home? Iowans certainly believe it]. I was skeptical of the polling, and the fact that it found that 77 percent of Iowans wouldn’t live anywhere else.

As a lifelong Iowa resident and lover of the many positive aspects of this fine state, I was dreading my daily responsibility of taking the dog for his morning walk in the bone-chilling, zero-degree temperatures that can drop to minus 11 degrees with wind chill.

My immediate thought was the poll must have been taken on a nicer day than today. I suggest that if the poll was conducted on a day like today, the results may have reflected an entirely different view. (Editor's note: The Iowa Poll was conducted Feb. 10-13. The average high temperature during that period was 28 degrees.)

Let's support women's right to their bodies

I am a twinless twin, who lost his twin in the womb. I am the miracle child to my mother. My life is the best thing that has ever happened to me, yet I cannot comprehend how anybody can condone the forcing of pregnancy.

I cannot believe with all of the burdens involved in pregnancy and all of the sacrifices a woman makes in those nine months that politicians expect women to feel okay with all of the abortion restrictions.

Lauri Arndorfer wrote a letter about this and I feel she is gravely missing the point [No one has the right to take away a life]. The unborn fetus may be considered a human to some, but whose body is being used as its means for survival?

It is a disgrace that our leaders, such as Rep. Sandy Salmon and Sen. Jake Chapman, stand for women forcibly slaving their bodies over to somebody else. In a truly conservative, limited government, where people are divided over what is moral/immoral, it should be left to the people to decide for themselves what to do.

This pro-life crusade needs to settle down. I used to support your cause until you started advocating for laws that made decisions for women.

Research candidate websites you see on social media

Many people post things online regarding political candidates, not knowing if the information is credible. I have not heard of some of the websites and when I Google them, there is no information regarding their credibility.

If you would research this material before you post it, you might find out if it's justified. Many people believe what they read and they are believing, possibly, things that are not true. President Trump refers to fake news, and well, much of this might be.

I have seen posts regarding both sides and have questioned their credibility, but I don’t take the time to read posts unless I have searched the source material.

Massage therapists need licensing and training

I am a licensed massage therapist in Iowa. I am writing regarding your editorial's misunderstanding of therapeutic massage.

Any time government removes licensure requirements, it diminishes the importance of education and training [Don't add government red tape by licensing art therapists]. The purpose of a license is to give clients confidence that the professional they have chosen is qualified to safely perform their service.

Many people are unaware of the medical implications of massage. Without education and training, a lay person may not know things like: How long after an injury should you wait to receive a massage? Is a massage contraindicated for heart disease? Should you massage someone with edema?

A therapeutic massage for the purpose of improving health, versus relaxation, impacts the central nervous system. It also affects the lymphatic system (the body’s natural immune system), the digestive system and the circulatory system. It is essential to understand these systems and the effects of massage on them.

Beyond the medical concerns of people practicing without advanced education, the fear of sexual misconduct is great. It is unheard-of to take a standard of practice away in a field where the misuse could be so great.

Many Iowans are likely unaware of the change in licensing requirements, leaving them open to negligence and misconduct.

Dolphin remark was blown out of proportion

I have heard both tapes of Gary Dolphin's ""indiscretions."" First, he simply stated something any knowledgeable Iowa fan would know to be true. It has been decades since Iowa has been able to recruit the quintessential point guard every elite team must have to advance far into the tournament [LISTEN: Hear the 'negative remarks' that had Iowa broadcaster Gary Dolphin apologizing Tuesday night].

The fact that he mentioned one player's name specifically in his comments was, I'm sure if he were asked, something he regrets most about the incident, other than not double-checking to make sure his microphone was dead.

A simple reprimand by management along with the task of personally making amends with Coach Fran McCaffery and the player would have seemed punishment enough.

Now, Dolphin finds himself in the hot seat for comparing a player to King Kong during his Iowa-Maryland post-game comments. Anyone who listens to the recording couldn't help but agree the intent of his message was to be complimentary to the player and in no way meant as a racial slur [Iowa radio announcer Gary Dolphin suspended for basketball season after 'King Kong' reference].

He was simply emphasizing the player's physical dominance and unparalleled stature on the court. The justification for controversy that has ensued is as fictional as the character itself.

Smollett breeds more hate in the world

Sadly, it appears Jussie Smollett used his own hate to twist the learned and artificially ingrained racism and view of Trump to further his own goals. His family has to be terribly shamed by the shocking allegations against him and upset that Smollett's $1 million income has dried up.

If he's convicted, he may serve jail time to atone. What he was missing as a child was someone who would give him swift kicks in the behind each time he fell into the trap from black leaders and politicians who are generationally breeding racism.

Trump Jr. made the remarks while speaking on Fox & Friends about Jussie Smollett, the actor who has been charged with filing a false police report after he allegedly staged an attack on himself. He claimed the attackers were supporters of the president.

“I put out a tweet, sort of sarcastically hitting some of the Jussie Smollett thing which is like, ‘Man I’m really shocked that you know people in downtown Chicago on the coldest night of the year weren’t actually there wearing MAGA hats,'” he told the hosts. “Because, you know, if you wore a MAGA hat in downtown Chicago, you probably wouldn’t last too long—ok, about two seconds until you get shot.”

The president has repeatedly criticized Chicago’s gun violence rate, calling it a “total disaster.”

However, as several people quickly pointed out in light of his son’s remarks on Monday–there is a Trump Tower in downtown Chicago.

Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson appeared on Good Morning America on Monday to defend the Chicago Police Department's investigation.

He dismissed the actor's claim that the cheque was for personal training, adding that there was ""surveillance footage and physical evidence"" to prove the attack was a hoax, reports Mail Online.

Rejecting Smollett's lawyer's claim that he has been vilified, Johnson said: ""He still has the presumption of evidence and he'll get his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route.

""I can tell you this, there's a lot more evidence that has not been presented yet that does not support his version of the incident.""

""There is still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that simply does not support his version.

""It's not the Chicago PD saying he did something. It's the evidence, the facts and the witnesses saying this.""

Smollett is accused of paying brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo to stage a fake racist attack on him to get attention.

There is still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that simply does not support his version Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson

But the brothers claim the cash was for them to train him for five weeks after Smollett ""wanted abs like his"", reported TMZ.

Both Abel and Ola agreed to train Jussie, and also give him a five-week nutrition plan, they reportedly say.

A few days before the alleged ""attack"", Smollett paid the two men with the cheque's memo reading ""5 weeks training nutrition plan"".

Last week, Smollett told officers he has a drug problem as they arrested him for allegedly staging the attack to boost his career, according to US reports.

Cops later said the Empire star had bought ecstasy from one of the brothers said to have helped him in the elaborate hoax.



HOAX ALLEGATIONS

Police charged Smollett last Wednesday with staging the violent attack in Chicago and he handed himself in the next morning.

During his arrest he reportedly told officers he struggled with drug use and had never been treated, TMZ reports.

And police papers say text messages appear to show Smollett asking pal and Empire extra Abel Osundairo for ""Molly"" - a street name for ecstasy.

If he is convicted, a drug problem could be used as a mitigating factor and get his sentence reduced, US reports say.

Police said the actor messaged Abel days before saying: ""Might need your help on the low.""

SMOLLETT CHARGED

Smollett reportedly headed straight to the Empire TV set from court to plead with cast members after being released on £76,000 bail on Thursday.

Sources told TMZ that Jussie arrived late on the TV series set and then begged his cast mates to believe he did not orchestrate the hoax.

Earlier on Thursday, the actor was told to surrender his passport when he appeared in front of State of Illinois Circuit Court Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr.

The judge called the hate-crime hoax allegations against the star “utterly outrageous,” reports the New York Post.

This is just one incident...there are real victims of crimes of that nature, hate crimes, and I just hope people don't treat them with scepticism Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson

“The most violent, despicable part of it, if true, is the noose,” he said. “That symbol conjures up such evil in this country’s history.”

Johnson added that he did not want Smollett's case to act as a deterrent to true victims of hate crimes.

The singer, who wore an orange prison jumpsuit in court, identified himself to the judge at the start of the hearing, but did not speak again during the proceedings.

Once the hearing was over, Kelly returned to D. O. C. Division 8 RTU, with the singer still unable to cover his $1 million bond.

That is where Cook County houses individuals who they believe would be at risk in the general inmate population.

Kelly's lawyer, Steven Greenberg, responded to the charges with a statement over the weekend, saying: 'We haven't seen any evidence, any reason to believe these allegations are credible. He's a rock star. He doesn't need to have nonconsensual sex.'

Trapped in the prison system: R Kelly (above on Monday in a courtroom sketch) appeared in court on Monday where his lawyer Steven Greenberg entered a not guilty plea on his behalf to 10 counts of aggravated sex abuse

Got him: The incidents allegedly took place between 1998 and 2010, and is unclear if the grand jury is done hearing testimony and evidence in the case (Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx at a press conference on Friday)

Aggravated criminal sexual abuse is a Class 2 felony with a sentencing range of 3-7 years in prison. He faces up to 70 years behind bars if convicted.

These new charges come one week after the emergence of a rape tape that allegedly features Kelly and a minor.

And on Monday, lawyer Michael Avenatti stated that he is working to obtain new tapes that allegedly show Kelly with underage females.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx spoke about the charges at a brief press conference on Friday.

She went through the charges related to each of the four victims, using only initials to identify the women.

First was H.W., who was under the age of 17 between the dates of May 26, 1998 and May 25, 1999.

Kelly is charged with four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for the alleged offenses involving that victim.

Those include an instance of 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and H.W's sex organ,' an instance where the contact was with 'H.W's mouth' and when 'Robert Kelly touched his penis to H.W's breast.'

The fourth count stems from the claim that 'Robert Kelly touched his mouth to H.W's breast.'

R.L. was involved in an incident which occurred between September 26, 1998 and September 25, 2001 when she was a minor.

That alleged incident resulted in two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse - one for 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and R.L's sex organ' one for contact with her 'mouth.'

Once the hearing was over, Kelly returned to D. O. C. Division 8 RTU, with the singer still unable to cover his $1 million bond

The third victim L.C. was of the age of consent on February 18, 2003.

'A grand jury returned an indictment of one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse based on the transmission of semen by Robert Kelly upon any part of the body of the victim for the purpose of sexual gratification during the course of the underlying forcible felony of Attempt Criminal Sexual Assault,' said Foxx.

The fourth and final victim was identified as J.P., and the incidents she was involved in led to the final three sexual abuse charges against Kelly.

Those incidents took place between May 1, 2009 and January 31, 2010, and the victim was under the age of 17.

In that case there was 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and J.P's sex organ,' 'mouth' and 'the transmission of semen by Robert Kelly.'

Foxx had made a very public plea for accusers to come forward last month, and there could be more charges to come.

This comes just one day after the Cook County State's Attorney's Office announced that Jussie Smollett had been indicted by a grand jury on a single charge of disorderly conduct for falsifying a police report.

The speed with which Smollett was indicted had led some to question why the State's Attorney's Office seemed to be taking their time with Kelly but rushing through the Smollett case.

Illinois is just one of the states where there is an open investigation into Kelly.

Lawyers for the Southern District of New York have also been meeting with alleged victims as well as agents from the IRS and FBI while the Department of Homeland Security has also opened up a probe.

This all comes in the wake of the Lifetime series Surviving R Kelly.

The six-part docuseries ended on a devastating note, with the parents of one of the young women who had run away with Kelly seen throwing rocks at his studio windows trying to get the attention of their daughter.

When they called Chicago police however, the members of law enforcement were not able to legally enter the property.

Kelly had yet to be hit with any criminal charges in the wake of the docuseries until Friday."

While that’s going on, President Trump’s former personal attorney and “fixer” Michael Cohen will publicly testify before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and then the following day privately with the House Intelligence Committee.

As usual, Don Jr. dismissed the looming Mueller probe, as well as the investigation by the Southern District of New York which even prominent Republicans such as Chris Christie warn may be even more perilous to Trump.

Instead, he turned his attention to more pressing topics at hand, such as a conspiracy theory in which he believes he’s being censored by Twitter and Instagram. As an example, Trump Jr. cited a social media post that was pulled in which he commented on the Jussie Smollett case.

“I put out a tweet somewhat sarcastically hitting on the Jussie Smollett thing. Just like, ‘Man I’m really shocked that people in downtown Chicago on the coldest night of the year weren’t actually there wearing MAGA hats.’ Because, you know, if you wore a MAGA hat in downtown Chicago you probably wouldn’t last too long, OK? About two seconds until you get shot.”

“And all of a sudden I get this note from Instagram, it’s been pulled,” he continued. It’s kind of difficult to take him seriously when he can’t even keep the platform that supposedly censored him straight by using Twitter and Instagram interchangeably — but what was that he said about Chicago???

I know they seem like parody, but I swear all these Don Jr quotes are real pic.twitter.com/ETlLIHSUuZ — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 25, 2019

Oh.

If that wasn’t bad enough, Don Jr. went on to claim that “hoax” hate crimes outweigh real ones, which is just wholly and patently untrue.

Social media conspiracies and made-up statistics aside, it seems as if Trump Jr. is very much trying to steer the conversation away from the inevitable. We wish him the best of luck with that because Mueller is coming, and so are the indictments. He may just get one of his very own!

Howard allegedly began ‘screaming’ at Smollett to come clean about what really happened…

UPDATE (3/26/19), 11:35 AM EST: The charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett — over allegedly staging a racial attack against himself in Chicago on January 29 — have all been dropped, his Chicago-based attorney Ronald Safer confirms to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued the following statement (on March 26, 2019 at 1:15 PM EST) in wake of this development: “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”

UPDATE: Terrence Howard’s bodyguard vehemently denied this report in an Instagram post on February 25. In a lengthy post, he wrote that the report, which claimed Howard got into a screaming match with Smollett on the set of Empire over his alleged attack, is a “non factual” story. Read the bodyguard’s full message, here.

ORIGINAL: After he was released from police custody in Chicago, Jussie Smollett, 36, returned to the Empire set on Thursday, February 21, where he was angrily confronted by his co-star Terrence Howard, 49, according to TMZ, which sites sources on set of the hit Fox show. Howard reportedly had a “complete meltdown” on the Chicago set after Smollett was arrested for allegedly staging a hate crime attack on himself on January 29. Howard, who reportedly did not believe Smollett’s story from the get-go, interrogated Smollett when they met on set that day, sources say. Things reportedly got so heated during the exchange, that at point, Howard began to scream at Smollett to reveal the truth about the alleged attack.

Howard was so upset that the sources claim he refused to come out of his trailer for most of the day when Smollett arrived back on set. After the reported altercation, Terrence was eventually nowhere to be found on set, sources tell TMZ. And, Howard wasn’t the only one upset that day. — Other members of the cast and crew reportedly agreed with Howard, despite Smollett’s reported apology to his Empire family.

When he returned to the set, TMZ previously reported that Smollett addressed the cast and crew with a heartfelt apology. “I’m sorry I’ve put you all through this and not answered any calls,” Smollett allegedly said at the time. “I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.”

Nonetheless, whether the apology did occur or not, Smollett’s job couldn’t be saved. His role as Jamal was officially cut from the show’s final episodes of its fifth season later that day. Empire executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer released the following statement on February 22: “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Despite Howard’s reported confrontation with Smollett, he confused fans about where he stands on the issue, when he posted a video of Smollett to Instagram on February 24 — two days after the reported argument. “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you,” Howard captioned a video of Smollett holding his son, Hero, while on a private plane together.

Howard also fired back at a fan who criticized him for supporting Smollett. “Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” he wrote on Instagram. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Chicago police charged Smollett this week with filing a false report for allegedly staging a January 29 attack on himself, making it look like he was the victim of a hate crime. Smollett has denied the charge and was released on $100,000 bail. His next hearing is set for March 14."

Kelly Pleads Not Guilty to All 10 Counts of Aggravated Sexual Abuse,[],https://media.popculture.com/2019/01/r-kelly-getty-jason-kempin-staff-20053074-640x320.jpeg,"['come', 'abuse', 'counts', 'guilty', 'sexual', 'aggravated', 'attorney', 'alleged', 'weeks', 'pleads', 'r', 'charges', 'kellys', 'greenberg', 'kelly']","Maintaining his innocence, R. Kelly's attorney entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Kelly to all 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse in a Chicago courtroom Monday morning.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, who has previously denied all assault allegations against the R&B singer, also told the judge that Kelly has turned in his passport, though the 52-year-old has not been able to post bail yet. Kelly' next court date is scheduled for March 22, CNN reports.

Wearing an orange jumpsuit and flanked by sheriff's deputies, Kelly was in court Monday.

The not guilty pleas come a few days after Kelly was indicted on Friday on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against four victims, thee of whom would have been underage at the time of the alleged crimes.

On Saturday, Kelly's bond was set at $1 million. To leave custody he'd have to pay 10 percent of the total, or $100,000 — but he couldn't come up with the cash, with Greenberg alluding to financial problems.

""This is someone who should be wealthy at this stage of his career,"" Greenberg said, citing ""mismanagement,"" ""hangers-on"" and ""bad deals"" as some of the reasons Kelly ""really doesn't have any money at this point.""

Until Kelly can come up with the bail money, he will continue to be transported between Cook County Jail and the courthouse, both of which have seen their fair share of star power in the last week or so, with Empire star Jussie Smollett being booked at the jail and heard at the courthouse as well.

Cook County State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx said that Kelly's alleged abuse took place over 12 years. Prosecutors say there is video that shows multiple sex acts, allegedly with Kelly and a 14-year-old girl.

But Greenberg said he doesn't believe the accusers. ""I believe all the women are lying,"" Greenberg said.

High-profile attorney Michael Avenatti, who is representing one of the accusers, called Greenberg's statements ""outrageous and completely unprofessional.""

Avenatti reportedly played a role in getting key evidence in the hands of a grand jury in recent weeks, resulting in last week's indictment.

The attorney said that Kelly will likely face federal charges for his alleged crimes in the near future. ""I expect R Kelly to also face federal charges in the coming weeks/months. These charges will be distinct from the crimes for which he was charged yesterday and will result in a separate criminal proceeding,"" Avenatti tweeted on Saturday. ""Ultimately, R Kelly will rightly spend his remaining days in prison."""

Citing unnamed sources, entertainment website TMZ reported over the weekend that a $3,500 check was for the brothers’ help in getting Smollett more physically fit for the filming of a music video.

But in an interview on “Good Morning America that aired Monday morning, Johnson stuck by police claims that the money was for the brothers’ help in orchestrating the attack early in the morning on Jan. 29.

“They said that he paid them $3,500 with a check,” Johnson told co-host Robin Roberts.

“But did they say what it was for?” Roberts asked.

“Yeah, to carry out this incident,” Johnson replied.

Smollett was charged last Thursday with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report when he told Chicago police that two men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, hit him and wrapped a rope around his neck while yelling, “This is MAGA country!”

Johnson’s appearance on “Good Morning America” comes almost two weeks after Smollett was interviewed on the same show and said he was angry that people were questioning his story.

The two brothers were taken into custody the night before the interview aired. The brothers were held for two days, during which they told detectives they were paid thousands of dollars by the actor to stage the attack, authorities have said.

On Monday, Johnson told Roberts there is more evidence against Smollett that hasn’t been disclosed yet.

“There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that does not support the version that he gave,” Johnson said. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply doesn’t support his version of what happened.”

While emphasizing the presumption of innocence, Johnson reiterated concerns he expressed last week that the case could discourage legitimate hate crime victims from coming forward.

“I just hope people don’t judge other folks that are victims of these types of crimes because this is just one particular incident, and that’s the damaging part of it. We damage the city’s reputation,” Johnson said. “There are real victims of crimes of that nature. Hate crimes. And I just hope that people don’t treat them with skepticism. You know, this is one particular incident and it has to stand on its own merits.”

New wrinkles in the case are emerging, particularly regarding the Chicago PD’s revelation of a $3,500 check that police say Smollett used to enlist two Nigerian brothers, who were Empire extras, to fake the physical assault. However, Smollett’s team claims that this document doesn’t show that he hired the brothers to physically attack him but, instead, to physically train him (i.e., help him lose 20 pounds) for a music video shoot.

Yes, this case is growing even more nebulous after people were incredulous (and rolling with laughter) that Smollett would use such an easily traceable method to pay the brothers. TMZ claims to have receipts, though, in the form of the purported check and texts. According to the memo line on the check, the fee was for “5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.” As for the texts, TMZ describes them and a Venmo payment:

On January 28 — the day before the “attack” — Bon wrote, “I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.” Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, “This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.” You also see a text showing a calendar where February 23 is marked “Don’t Go.” The sources say that’s the date of the music video shoot. There’s another screenshot from Sept. 27, 2018, presumably showing Jussie has paid Ola in the past. It’s a Venmo payment of $100 to Bola (Abimbola aka Abel) for “Training.”

ABC News has also published a copy of the purported check, which of course would not disprove the allegations against Smollett but could create reasonable doubt for a jury to take his side. TMZ further notes word from FBI sources that they haven’t yet determined who wrote the threatening letter sent to the Empire set a week prior to the alleged attack, even though the Chicago PD declared that Smollett sent the document to himself.

Over the weekend, Empire co-star Terrence Howard came forward to support the embattled actor, but the Chicago PD is standing firm. On Monday morning, Superintendent Eddie Johnson visited GMA, where he told Robin Roberts that law enforcement has more evidence (that hasn’t been revealed) to convict Smollett of disorderly conduct (filing a false report):

“[Smollett] still has a presumption of innocence and he still has his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route. There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that doesn’t support the version that he gave us. There’s still a lot of video evidence, physical evidence and testimony that doesn’t support what he said happened.”

""They're literally trying to find something they can make a big deal of,"" Trump Jr. told Fox News' ""Fox and Friends."" ""What they did is they put incredible pressure on regular guys that couldn’t afford million dollars in legal fees, got them to slip up, say something incorrectly. They pretended they’re their friends.”

But the incidents are ""only things that people did in past lives, in 2006 before we even thought we'd ever get into this crazy world,"" he added.

The president's former attorney, Michael Cohen, is to testify this week before three congressional committees, and Trump Jr. said he thinks it is ""pretty pathetic"" that the court would bring in a ""convicted felon and known liar"" like Cohen while his father is heading to Vietnam to speak with North Korean Chairman Kim Jong Un.

Trump Jr. also complained Monday that he believes social media sites are targeting him, including on his comments on the scandal concerning ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett and accusations he created a hoax attack.

He said his comments were pulled from Twitter, and then he learned, through followers, that his name does not turn up as a top find on Instagram when they search.

Despite the apparent hoax by Smollett, Trump Jr. said hate crimes exist and racism remains a ""very real problem.""

""These things really do a disservice from people who are truly afflicted by this, not some actor who is making $65,000 an episode who wants higher pay,"" said Trump Jr."

Williams is a field organizer for Leadership Institute, a nonprofit that trains conservative activists. He was tabling in the campus's main plaza on Tuesday to help recruit new members for the conservative youth group Turning Point USA, which espouses limited government principles and rails against left-wing forces in academics.

Still sporting a black eye, Williams told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday that some people walking by took offense to the table's sign, ""Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,"" a reference to the Jussie Smollett case. According to him, two men approached him in what he described as an erratic fashion, accusing him of promoting racism and violence, and one of them ""took his aggression out on us.""

He said he started recording the men out of fear for his safety. At one point, his phone was slapped out of his hand.

""We were talking to a potential new member when this happened,"" he said. ""These two people just approached our table, as I said very erratically, and started cussing at us, and that's when I knew this was probably a troublesome situation … His friend smacked my phone out of my hand.""

A man in a black shirt swore, flipped over his table, and then repeatedly cursed at him, threatening to shoot him at one point and calling him a ""c—t,"" ""motherf—er,"" and ""racist, little inbred bitch."" A bystander's video showed him tussling with Williams and finally sucker-punching him in the eye, walking away yelling, ""f—ing c–t!""

Police do not believe the suspect is a student at the university.

The attack was reported to police Tuesday afternoon, and Berkeley released a statement condemning the assault, saying, ""Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason. That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here.""

Turning Point chapter president Milton Zerman was there and said Williams did nothing to deserve the attack, according to ABC News.

""The individual who was the perpetrator says you promote violence,"" he said. ""Which is very ironic given he's the one who assaulted my friend and, again, threatened to shoot him.""

""It started off as verbal and it kinda heightened up where he was breaking down posters and taking down a table,"" said Arda Erbil, who witnessed the attack with his friend Alexander Szarka. Szarka, who filmed the altercation, told Fox News the university's response to the incident was ""weak sauce.""

It's another literal black eye for the school, which already has a reputation for being a hotbed of leftist intolerance. In August of 2017, black-clad, radical ""Antifa"" members attacked a peaceful, right-wing demonstration in the town of Berkeley. Protesters also caused $100,000 in damage in February of that year when they set fires and rioted over the invitation to campus of far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.

Berkeley College Republicans president Matt Ronnau, a junior who knows Williams, told the Washington Free Beacon he hasn't always felt safe when he's tabled in the main plaza to promote the club.

""People have come up and I've been spit at, and other people have been assaulted like Hayden, so it all depends on what you're doing,"" he said, adding he thought the campus's reputation as intolerant toward conservatives was deserved.

Ronnau, who's been president of BCR since May, said he wasn't surprised at the incident. He also said he didn't expect a resolution any time soon, given what he described as the campus police slow-walking investigations of past incidents against conservatives on campus.

""I was pretty shocked that it had happened, but I wasn't, honestly, surprised, which is kind of disappointing, just given how Berkeley is and incidents that we've experienced in the past,"" he said. ""People here just don't get it. They just don't know how to act when someone expresses a viewpoint that they disagree with.""

Former Berkeley College Republicans president Brad Devlin, also a junior, said he had ""routinely received verbal threats"" and had his ""property destroyed"" while at the school.

""I do think the Berkeley leftist orthodoxy makes it an incredibly intolerant place, especially since the election of Donald Trump, and we’ve seen that intolerance playing out now for nearly two and a half years on campus,"" he told the Free Beacon in an email. ""I regularly am asked by prospective students that are right leaning whether or not Berkeley is a safe place to get their college degree. I say it’s a challenging place not only academically, but also socially and culturally because of the leftist dogma.""

In a February 23 appearance on MSNBC, Washington Post editorial writer and columnist Jonathan Capehart blamed President Trump for the gullibility of those who believed Jussie Smollett’s made up claim of being physically attacked by Trump supporters. He contended Trump “actually stokes the atmosphere of menace and insecurity that millions of Americans feel across this country.”

He added that Trump and his supporters “are using the Jussie Smollett situation to rhetorically bash people who are afraid for their own existence and their own lives,” which he called “really despicable.”

“You know, if you wore a MAGA hat in downtown Chicago you probably wouldn’t last too long,” Trump said, in reference to the alleged attack on actor Jussie Smollett, which Chicago police claim was staged by Smollett himself. “About two seconds ‘til you get shot.”

TMZ reported on Friday that “various law enforcement sources” told them that Chicago police chief Eddie Johnson had “overstated things,” and on Sunday the same outlet reported that Smollett had evidence to counter the Chicago PD’s claims.

That hasn’t stopped Donj, however. Speaking about Instagram’s “censorship” of one of his many posts about Smollett , Trump said his post stated he was shocked that people in Chicago weren’t wearing MAGA hats on the coldest day of the year.

On Instagram, Trump claimed that the social media platform removed the post. The post has since been restored. On his Fox & Friends spot, Trump went on to claim that he was being told by followers that Instagram was preventing some of them from liking his posts.

However, Trump’s performance shined when he spoke about how Smollett’s supposed sham of an attack was a disservice to all other credible racist hate crimes, as if he hadn’t baselessly alleged that Smollett’s report was fake from the start.

“This was a couple weeks ago, I started sort of questioning it before others because it just didn’t seem to add up to me,” Trump said, trying to rehab his own bad faith tweets into some sort of investigative gumshoe narrative. “It takes guts to actually go out there and question the narrative.”

“There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave,” Johnson told Robin Roberts. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

The interview comes days after Chicago police held a press conference asserting Smollett set up a hoax because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on Fox’s TV series “Empire.” On Jan. 29, Smollett filed a claim that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime. Last Thursday, Smollett turned himself in to police to face a charge of filing a false police report.

When Smollett initially reported the incident, he alleged that attackers doused him in bleach and put a noose around his neck. Johnson explained to Roberts that Smollett told police although his attackers were wearing ski masks covering their faces, he could see they were “white-skinned.”

Police believe that Smollett paid two brothers, Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, to orchestrate the assault. Johnson said it wasn’t till the 47th hour of a 48-hour investigation that the brothers began cooperating with investigators.

Johnson clarified that Smollett has the assumption of innocence until his day in court. Smollett has denied having played any role in staging the attack. Johnson said despite the red flags that came up during the initial investigation, the police department “has to maintain the integrity of the investigation.”

Johnson also discussed race relations within the police department and potential “mistrust” from the public.

“The city of Chicago and the Chicago police department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that, and I’m acutely aware of that,” Smollett said. “But we didn’t earn this particular incident and I just refuse to let us have to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary. I just want people to understand that’s a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department. It’s my responsibility to ensure the record gets set straight.”

Johnson said he hopes the controversy around the Smollett case doesn’t make it harder for victims of hate crimes to come forward in the future.

“There are real victims of crimes of that nature, hate crimes, and I just hope people don’t treat them with skepticism,” he said. “This is one particular incident, and it has to stand on its own merits.”

Fox announced Friday Smollett has been removed from the final episodes from Season 5 of “Empire” in the wake of his arrest."

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson revealed that there is a lot of information leading investigators to believe the “Empire” actor was not actually the victim in the hate crime he alleged took place last month, speaking with “Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts on Monday.

“Let me just put this out there first and foremost right now that he still has the presumption of innocence until he has his day in court,” Johnson said.

“There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that doesn’t support the version that he gave us. There’s still a lot of video evidence, physical evidence and testimony that doesn’t support what he said happened,” he said.

Johnson explained that Chicago police regarded the 36-year-old actor as the victim and treated the alleged assault as a hate crime from the outset.

“The entire time we investigated the incident he was treated like a victim,” he said, discussing Smollett’s claim before his arrest for disorderly conduct and for filing a false police report, alleging two men had attacked him, poured a chemical on him and put a rope around his neck, while yelling racist and homophobic slurs at him. He could face up to three years in prison if convicted.

“I refused to characterize Jussie Smollett as a suspect unless we had concrete evidence,” Johnson said.

“The 47th hour that we had those two individuals in custody is when it changed,” he said, referring to brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo who were apprehended for 48 hours and became “cooperating witnesses” in the 47th hour, adding that investigators “gathered up a lot of evidence and facts before then.”

“We worked very closely with their lawyer,” Johnson told Roberts, citing the $3,500 check from Smollett to the two men.

The actor was also accused of sending himself hate mail to the “Empire” set. Investigation of the letter, which reportedly contained “MAGA” messages and what turned out to be a harmless white powder, in being conducted by the FBI. Smollett could face up to 10 years behind bars if he is convicted of mail fraud, according to Fox News.

“If he mailed that threatening letter to himself by using the post office, he engaged in postal fraud. That’s five to 10 years in jail — that’s three times what he’s facing for filing a false report if the feds want to go there,” Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano said.

Johnson leveled a blistering statement about Smollett in a press conference after the actor turned himself into Chicago police last week.

Meanwhile, the Police Superintendent emphasized on “Good Morning America” that the Chicago police were not out to get the actor, having initially sympathized with him after his report.

“What’s important for people to realize is it’s not that the Chicago police saying he did something. It’s the evidence, the facts, the witnesses that are saying this,” Johnson maintained.

“The Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that. And I’m acutely aware of that,” Johnson acknowledged. “But we didn’t earn this particular incident and I just refuse to let us take that shot if we have evidence of the contrary.”

“I want people to understand that (filing a false police report) is a damaging thing to a city and to a police department. It’s my responsibility to make sure the record gets set straight,” he said. “I just hope people don’t judge other people that are victims of these types of crimes.”"

The disclosure of additional evidence followed ABC News’ obtaining and posting a copy of the $3,500 check allegedly written by Smollett to Abimbola Osundairo, one of the two brothers who now say they were paid that amount by Smollett to stage the phony attack. In the memo line of the check appear the words: “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go).”

“Don’t Go” is the title of an upcoming music video that Smollett apparently had been training for with the assistance of Osundairo, a body-building sometime actor with whom Smollett is thought to have worked out. The check is dated Jan. 23, 2019, six days before the Jan. 29 attack incident.

Johnson, who on Friday delivered an impassioned, occasionally angry summary of the Smollett case during a press conference, including the police department’s assertions that the actor staged the supposedly racist and homophobic attack in an effort to boost his career and get a raise for his work on Empire.

Today, Johnson explained what Roberts called his “passionate” delivery: “I grew up in the tail end of the Civil Rights era,” Johnson said, adding that he was raised in Chicago’s Cabrini-Green housing projects. “The symbolism of the noose is very offensive,” Johnson said, referring to the rope that Smollett said had been placed around his neck during the alleged attack.

“There are real victims of crimes of that nature, hate crimes, and I hope that people don’t treat those with skepticism,” Johnson said, repeatedly reminding GMA viewers that Smollett has the “presumption of innocence” until his “day in court, if he goes that route.”

“It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something,” Johnson said. “It’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this.”

Smollett has denied the criminal charges.

That presumption of innocence was emphasized yesterday in an Instagram post by Smollett’s Empire co-star Terrence Howard, who posted a short, sweet video of Smollett playing with a baby during what appears to be an airplane flight. “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you,” Howard, who plays Empire‘s Lucious Lyon, father to Smollett’s Jamal.

When an Instagram follower criticized Smollett in the comment section of Howard’s post, Howard responded: “sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie that I know. That Jussie that I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgement is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for something that I’ve called my son for 5 years. It’s God’s job to judge and it is ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There’s nothing more harmful than a fake friend. Real talk.”

Now, in a new interview on “Good Morning America,” Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson is claiming that there is, in fact, additional proof that Smollett staged a hate crime back in January — the public simply has not seen it yet.

Speaking with anchor Robin Roberts, Johnson revealed: “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support [Smollett’s] version of what happened.”

Seemingly addressing the public scrutiny surrounding this case and his department, Johnson defended the Chicago P.D. and their investigation.

“It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago police saying that he did something. It’s the evidence, the facts, and the witnesses that are saying this.”

When asked about his “passionate” press conference appearance, Johnson explained why he was so “angry” and “offended”: “The symbolism of a noose is very offensive. The city of Chicago has this issue.

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox television series, took to Instagram and posted a video of Smollett holding a giggling baby boy with the message: ""All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you.""

The post on Saturday came a day after Empire producers announced that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season, saying cast and crew were affected and they made the move ""to avoid further disruption on the set.""

The series, which is on a midseason break, returns on 13 March with nine episodes. Seven episodes were already completed before Smollett was charged last week with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men attacked him last month in downtown Chicago, hurling slurs and looping a rope around his neck. Investigators say he planned the hoax, soliciting the help of a friend and the friend's brother, because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett denies the allegations.

While some Empire cast members posted supportive messages on social media after Smollett claimed he was attacked, it appears Howard is the only one to do so after Smollett was charged. Fox also publicly supported Smollett after the initial claims.

Howard's post generated more than 385,000 views by midday on Sunday and countless comments, both critical and supportive.

Opinion contributor

Everyone is mad at Jussie Smollett right now: Progressives, many of whom fiercely expressed sympathy and support for Smollett shortly after his attack only to be embarrassed by these latest revelations. Conservatives, who are tired of hate crime hoaxes that invariably make conservatives look bad. And, especially, supporters of President Donald Trump — many of whom were slandered and reviled for their tenuous association with the apparently fake ""attack."" Most people don’t like this man; many openly hate him.

Here’s an alternative: Consider feeling sorry for Jussie Smollett.

Several weeks ago the actor — who is both black and gay — was reportedly attacked as part of a brutal, bigoted hate crime perpetrated by supporters of Donald Trump. Now it appears that he fabricated the entire thing, reportedly as a way to advance his career and increase his salary on the hit television show ""Empire."" That plan backfired spectacularly: Smollett was written out of the show’s final two episodes this season, and it’s in doubt whether he’ll return to the show at all.

Hate crime hoaxes, like Smollett's alleged attack, are more common than you think

Smollett's alleged plan to manufacture outrage diminishes impact of real hate crime

Jussie Smollett crying wolf helps no one: Readers sound off

Such are the wages of greed. Reports from the Associated Press and other news organizations suggest Smollett was being paid $65,000 to $100,000 per episode — not anywhere near the top level of television salaries, but a staggering sum nonetheless. Smollett wanted even more money on top of the copious amounts he was already earning; now he is earning no money and he probably has no career. He’s become a global laughingstock and will likely be known as a fraud for the rest of his life.

In one sense it’s understandable to feel disdain for Smollett, a man who apparently committed several serious crimes, wasted hundreds of police man-hours, and marshaled the support of countless well-meaning people across the country — all in service to a stupid self-serving falsehood. At the very least, most people can agree that Smollett should suffer some legal consequences for his terrible behavior.

Justice, compassion are not exclusive

But justice and compassion are not mutually exclusive. Punitive measures need not occur in a vacuum. You can want Smollett to pay for his behavior while still feeling pity and humanity toward him.

This is not at all an obvious proposal, at least not in our society, where social media has made vicious, merciless public executioners out of many of us. Many people seem to relish the chance to hate, to despise, to execrate and mock each other. Public disdain has become a national pastime. We revel in mass humiliation and retribution.

This brutal sort of public sport invariably obscures the truth of the moment. We like to make villains out of the people we like to hate. But almost nobody is a villain. Smollett himself is not a villain; at worst he is a greedy, stupid man, beset by idiotic impulses and motivated by a base, pitiful desire for more money and more fame. He is not Lex Luthor; he’s more like an inept shoplifter caught trying to steal a canned ham, the sort of crime that’s arguably more pathetic than shocking.

Smollett will pay for the rest of his life

What Smollett did was more serious than shoplifting, of course. But then again the consequences of his behavior are more serious still. Smollett will probably face some sort of prison sentence; he will likely become unemployable in the entertainment industry, the one job he’s known his whole life; most of his friends will probably lose most of their respect for him; even most of his family members will probably look at him differently, and more negatively.

Anyone who has ever embarrassed and alienated those closest to him will be able to tell you what a miserable experience it is. It’s like being evicted from one’s own life. Smollett is going to learn this the hard way. Nobody should envy him.

Yes, what Smollett did was terrible. No, there was no excuse for it. Yes, he should suffer consequences for it. But you do not have to hate him for it, and in fact there is great virtue in taking pity on him. He is in a lonely, miserable place right now, set apart from the rest of us, staring down a very dark path and facing a lifetime of awful repercussions.

You could do worse things than feel compassion for a man so beset by colossal stupidity and monumental suffering. The world is never in need of more anger. Hating Jussie Smollett will not solve anything at all. And feeling sorry for him will not hurt anything.

Because he is a vicious know-nothing, it was always going to get ugly. Spike Lee lost out on the Best Picture prize to the scandal-plagued Green Book, but he did take home his first career Oscar—he previously won an honorary statue for a distinguished career—courtesy of his adapted screenplay for BlacKkKlansman.

After a nice moment with his old friend Samuel L. Jackson, Lee used his acceptance speech to comment on our particular historical moment:

The word today is “irony.” The date, the 24th. The month, February, which also happens to be the shortest month of the year, which also happens to be Black History month. The year, 2019. The year, 1619. History. Her story. 1619. 2019. 400 years.

Four hundred years. Our ancestors were stolen from Mother Africa and bought to Jamestown, Virginia, enslaved. Our ancestors worked the land from can’t see in the morning to can’t see at night. My grandmother, [inaudible], who lived to be 100 years young, who was a Spelman College graduate even though her mother was a slave. My grandmother who saved 50 years of social security checks to put her first grandchild — she called me Spikie-poo — she put me through Morehouse College and N.Y.U. grad film. N.Y.U.!

Before the world tonight, I give praise to our ancestors who have built this country into what it is today along with the genocide of its native people. We all connect with our ancestors. We will have love and wisdom regained, we will regain our humanity. It will be a powerful moment. The 2020 presidential election is around the corner. Let’s all mobilize. Let’s all be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let’s do the right thing! You know I had to get that in there.

Lee traced his own family's experience in America as a vehicle for examining the 400 years since, as Malcolm X once put it, ""Plymouth Rock landed on us."" The detail that Lee's grandmother was a Spelman College graduate just one generation after a member of his family had been enslaved is a stunning reminder of how young and violent a country the United States is, and how its black citizens have found a way forward in spite of that. Along with the 90 years of Jim Crow, 60 years of separate-but-equal, and 35 years of racist housing policy that black Americans faced even after slavery was ended in a bloody Civil War, it's a stinging retort to the get-over-it-I-don't-want-to-hear-about-it historical denialism that was on show last week on Tucker Carlson's Fox News program.

Lee didn't mention the president by name, but he did mention 2020 and the notion that it would be a choice between love and hate. It's not the best sign that the President of the United States immediately identified that he was the ""hate"" option. But Trump received the message loud and clear, and reacted as he often does: by insulting the intelligence of a black person who criticized him.

Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts,etc.) than almost any other Pres! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2019

This is a throwback to Trump's knock on Barack Obama—that he couldn't deliver a speech without a teleprompter. Combined with Trump's suggestion Obama couldn't have gotten into an Ivy League school legitimately, the message was unequivocal. Of course, Trump has used a teleprompter frequently since he's gotten into public life, including at his rallies. He's not particularly known as a ""reader,"" either. And when he does go off-script—like in the non compos mentis exhibition in the Rose Garden a couple of weeks back, when he declared a national emergency while also declaring he didn't need to declare a national emergency—it is not pretty at all.

And, of course, Trump called Lee's speech ""racist."" It is not racist to talk about racism. This is the kind of whoever-smelt-it-dealt-it rhetoric on the issue that is common on Fox News, and also makes no sense. Racism will not go away if you act like it doesn't exist—or, as one of the least promising 2020 candidates put it, if you maintain you ""honestly don't see color."" Everyone has biases. You have to acknowledge them to overcome them. More to the point, BlacKkKlansman has a particularly nuanced take on the Black Panther rhetoric that sometimes verged on anti-white hatred—not that Trump will ever see the film.

Trump weighs in on the events in Charlottesville. August 15, 2017. JIM WATSON Getty Images

The Republican tax cut Trump mentioned will overwhelmingly benefit the rich, a group that is disproportionately white. In fact, the racial income gap continues to widen: In 2017, the median wealth of white households was $171,000. For black households, it was $17,100. This is tied closely to racial discrimination in mortgage-lending, which targeted black customers for predatory sub-prime loans heading into the Great Recession. African-American unemployment—like unemployment across the board—is indeed down near all-time lows. But it is still nearly twice the rate of white unemployment. Of the accomplishments listed, criminal justice reform is Trump's strongest: the bipartisan bill he signed at the end of last year was a great, if modest, first step forward on an issue that disproportionately impacts black Americans.

The fact is, though, that Trump's record of public racism is expansive, deep, and goes back decades. He launched his political career with a campaign to question whether the first black president was American at all—and thus, to make Obama illegitimate. He has scarcely looked back, culminating with his disgusting claim that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" at the white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. One side consisted of anti-racist counter-protesters. Surely, there were some very fine people there. The other side consisted of neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Confederates, and various other white-nationalist and white-supremacist groups. Are there ""very fine people"" who think it's a good idea to march alongside Nazis?

This, of course, was the crescendo of BlacKkKlansman, which featured footage from Charlottesville—particularly the moment when a white supremacist drove his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing a woman named Heather Heyer, in what even then-Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III called an act of domestic terrorism. Hate crimes and hate groups have been on the rise over the last couple of years, even if conservatives have begun to seize on Jussie Smollett's allegedly false report. Just last week, a white nationalist and aspiring domestic terrorist was arrested with 15 guns, 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and a hit list.

Throughout the film, there are echoes of our current moment—from the KKK's penchant for saying ""America First"" to the prominent role enjoyed by David Duke, then the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, who even then had designs on high political office. (The film mentions he began to call himself ""national director"" of the Klan in a bid for mainstream legitimacy.) Duke won a seat in the Louisiana state legislature in 1989, but ultimately lost his bid to represent the state in the United States Senate. Still, he has clambered back into some national prominence in the last couple of years. He's also a massive fan of President Donald Trump.

""Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa,"" the former head of the KKK said of Trump's ""Both Sides"" comment back in 2017. He also spoke at the rally itself.

""We are determined to take our country back,"" he said at one point. ""We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That’s what we believed in. That’s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take our country back.""

Maybe Duke is just confused about what the president represents. Certainly, by his depiction in BlacKkKlansman, he's never been confused about what David Duke or the Ku Klux Klan represent. Spike Lee doesn't seem confused by any of it.

Austin Collin']",https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5c740024ef0cf20b466d9e01/16:9/pass/jussie-smollett-police-check.jpg?mbid=social_retweet,"['support', 'smolletts', 'innocence', 'saying', 'evidence', 'check', 'draws', 'johnson', 'brothers', 'claim', 'smollett', 'questions', 'empire', 'jussie']","The Jussie Smollett case has not gotten any less messy—or confusing. The $3,500 check that Smollett allegedly used to pay brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo to stage a hate crime against him in January includes a memo line that reads, “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go).” Sources close to Smollett—who has maintained his innocence since formally being arrested for filing a false police report—say the Empire actor did not pay the brothers to attack him, but instead hired them to help him lose weight ahead of a music-video shoot. ABC News obtained a copy of the check that shows that memo line, as well as text messages between Smollett and one of the brothers regarding nutrition and exercise that seem to support that narrative.

Still, during an interview Monday with Good Morning America, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson maintained that during their police interrogation, the brothers indicated that the check was given to them explicitly for the attack—and that police have additional evidence supporting this theory that has not been made public yet.

Smollett has consistently denied staging his attack. In their most recent statement on Smollett’s behalf following an impassioned police briefing—and Smollett’s arrest—the actor’s attorneys wrote, “Today we witnessed an organized law-enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Johnson seemed to directly respond to that statement at the top of his G.M.A. appearance, which he began by saying, “Let me just put this out there first and foremost: that right now, [Smollett] still has the presumption of innocence, until he has his day in court.” When G.M.A.’s Robin Roberts asked Johnson why the Osundairo brothers changed their story—confessing to their alleged crime just one hour before police would have had to let them go—Johnson replied, “You know, we worked very closely with their lawyer. And their lawyer went in there and talked to them and whatever she said to them apparently got through to them to just tell the truth about what happened. And that’s what they decided to do.”

“It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago police saying he did something,” Johnson said. “It’s the evidence, the facts, and the witnesses that are saying this. So our job is to investigate it and bring the facts and the evidence to the state.”

Roberts asked whether the brothers explicitly said that Smollett’s check was meant to pay them for attacking him; Johnson answered in the affirmative. Before he left, Johnson added, “I can tell you this, Robin. There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that does not support the version that [Smollett] gave us. . . . There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence, and testimony that just simply doesn’t support his version of what happened.”

Smollett has been removed from the final two episodes of Empire Season 5. Fox has yet to renew the drama, but reports have emerged that if it does return for a sixth season, Smollett’s role—middle child Jamal Lyon—might be re-cast. (Representatives for Fox and Empire have not commented on the matter.) Over the weekend, however, Terrence Howard became the first Empire cast member to speak publicly in support of his colleague after his arrest."

OPINION: Greetings from the United States where the media continues to be consumed by the gob-smacking Jussie Smollett scandal.

The gay African-American star of Empire had claimed that two masked men yelled ""this is MAGA country"" while they beat him, threw a supposed chemical substance on him, put a noose around his neck, and spewed homophobic and racist insults before fleeing.

However, the Chicago Police have released overwhelming evidence after arresting Smollett, accusing him of orchestrating an elaborate and ""phony attack to take advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".

It's been another withering credibility blow for many media outlets who rushed to accept Smollett's victimhood, because it fitted snugly with their over-arching anti-Trump agenda.

To hell with checking the facts, proceeding with caution, or upholding any semblance of objectivity in this unseemly stampede, it seems. From Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Covington Catholic students and now Jussie Smollett, the Washington Post, New York Times, NBC, ABC and CNN have been quick to judge but slow to apologise when new facts emerge.

In fact, in the case of the Covington kids, even Australia's ABC is facing defamation action after one of its breakfast hosts called innocent 16-year-old student Nick Sandmann ""the face of hate"".

AP Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson speaks during a press conference after Smollett turned himself in on charges of disorderly conduct and filing a false police report. The actor staged a racist and homophobic attack because he was unhappy about his salary and wanted to promote his career, Johnson said on Thursday.

But the Smollett scandal has also proven to be a blunt learning curve for many Democratic presidential aspirants. Leading lights Kamala Harris and Cory Booker were quick to condemn what turned out to be a fictitious ""hate crime"".

Beyond the Smollett imbroglio, it's been fascinating to watch the Democratic early movers wrestle for attention in an increasingly crowded field. Current projections suggest there could be up to 30 candidates contesting the party's primary election.

California senator Harris is the media darling du jour; a fresh face, mixed-race, very personable, energetic and highly likeable. It's like an action replay of the media's infatuation with the young, ambitious Barack Obama in the lead-up to the 2008 election.

Despite failing to dethrone Ted Cruz in the Texas Senate race last November, Beto O'Rourke is still considered a hot prospect and is likely to enter the race next month.

Elizabeth Warren, one of the left's most rabid flame-throwers, is a fast-fading star on the stump, particularly after apologising for ""conflating family stories"" and exaggerating her claim to being of Cherokee Nation descent.

Last week, 77-year old Bernie Sanders launched his latest presidential bid, the original, real deal Democratic socialist, reprising the same old themes from his clash with Hillary Clinton in 2016. I respect his authenticity and his spectacular ability to generate grass-roots fundraising. More than 200,000 supporters donated US$6 million to his campaign within 24 hours of his launch of Feel the Bern 2.0.

The fresh faces, like Harris, are parroting his policy programme. He has set the table, swinging the Democratic Party zeitgeist hard left. Speculation swirls that he'll pick Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the power behind the Green New Deal, and his political protégé, as his running mate. Medicare for all, outlawing private health cover, free tertiary tuition, a universal guaranteed income and smashing the wealthy with 70 per cent income tax are all on the Democrats' radar.

Aside from Sanders, the majestic irony to me of this pile-on against the mega-rich is that Harris and co will happily schmooze with the Beverly Hills and Silicon Valley set, while bashing the super-rich on the stump.

In the scramble to out-left each other, Warren and Harris are now calling for reparations to African-Americans for slavery, despite its abolition 150 years ago.

The Dems are clearly freaked that with Black American unemployment plunging to record lows under Trump, their stranglehold on that constituency at the ballot box is in jeopardy.

But it could be another grumpy old white guy that ultimately saves the Democratic Party from its radical overreach.

Despite not officially seeking the nomination yet, the more centrist Joe Biden continues topping the polls, posing as the biggest threat to Trump's re-election."

Ask yourself a simple question: Do we really live in a nation filled with hate groups committing rampant hate crimes when the hip new thing is to perpetrate fake hate crimes to get attention?

The nation’s premier hate group, the Southern Poverty Law Center, laughably insists the answer is yes and that it’s getting worse under President Donald Trump. In its newest Intelligence Report (try not to laugh), the SPLC calculates that the number of “hate” groups in the U.S. supposedly increased for the fourth consecutive year in 2018. Citing the report, The New York Times warns, “The law center said the number of hate groups rose by 7 percent last year to 1,020, a 30 percent jump from 2014. That broadly echoes other worrying developments, including a 30 percent increase in the number of hate crimes reported to the F.B.I. from 2015 through 2017 and a surge of right-wing violence that the Anti-Defamation League said had killed at least 50 people in 2018.”

U.S. News & World Report laid bare the blame game with the headline “Trump ‘Fear-Mongering’ Fuels Rise of U.S. Hate Groups to Record.” Clearly, this SPLC report is political, not an honest assessment.

Two points about reports from the FBI and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). First, as we observed in November, the reason “hate” crimes are supposedly on the rise is because hundreds more law-enforcement agencies have begun reporting such a category. So if that category is to be taken seriously instead of dismissed as political and subjective, all it means is that we’re now keeping count. Second, assume for a moment that the leftist ADL’s numbers are even remotely accurate (they’re not). Fifty murders is 50 too many for any reason, but blacks kill 50 other blacks in American inner cities every week. Is it a worse crime when the race of the perpetrator is white?

That brings us back to the SPLC. The organization is a tax-exempt, charitable organization with an endowment of $432.7 million. This war chest is used to tabulate a few actually hateful groups, but much of the organization’s very uncharitable efforts are spent serving as a bludgeoning tool for the Leftmedia and the Democrat Party. Why else would the Family Research Council and the Alliance Defending Freedom be listed as “hate” groups? Or why would the SPLC warn about “members of Congress who traffic in hate and extremism” but only include Republicans and not, for example, actual anti-Semite Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar? A qualification for this political hate? Opposing same-sex marriage, just as Barack Obama did until 2012.

Despite — or rather because of — all this political chicanery, the SPLC is routinely cited by Leftmedia outlets as a “nonpartisan” and “objective” source for tracking hate in America. That is the essence of fake news."

Patrick Hoelck/FOX(LOS ANGELES) — Over the weekend, Terrence Howard spoke out in support of his Empire co-star Jussie Smollett, following a week which saw the actor charged with filing a false police report in connected to his alleged assault.

Howard posted a video on Instagram of Smollett holding a baby and captioned it, “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you.”

The post generated thousands of comments, some of them critical of Howard for continuing to support Smollett.

He responded to one of them, writing, “sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie that I know. The Jussie that I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgement is not for any of us to decide.”

He continued, “Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone that I’ve called my son for 5 years. It’s God’s job to judge and it is ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There’s nothing more harmful than a fake friend! Real talk.”

Empire’s producers announced last week that Smollett would be written out of the last 2 episodes of Empire’s fifth season.

Smollett was arraigned on a class-four felony charge of disorderly conduct/filing a false police report Thursday and released on $100,000 bond. During his court appearance, Smollett maintained his innocence, denying he staged the January 29 attack.

The actor claimed he was attacked by two men who hurled racist and homophobic epithets and put a noose around his neck.

Smollett had the full support of Empire's cast and crew when news first broke of his alleged assault. However, sources close to the production have now told TMZ that Howard was suspicious from the very start. After Smollett turned himself in to police on Thursday, Howard reportedly locked himself in his trailer all day.

The insiders said that Howard has been periodically confronting Smollett as the story progressed. Each time new holes seemed to emerge in his version of events, Howard would talk to the actor, and things got more and more tense over the last month.

Finally, things between the two actors reportedly hit a boiling point when Abel and Ola Osundairo were detained by police for nearly three days. Sources said that was when Howard and Smollett had their harshest encounter, with Howard screaming at Smollett to ""come clean"" on set.

When Smollett did address the entire cast and crew on Thursday night, sources said that Howard was not present. The actor reportedly represented a large portion of the cast and crew who believed that Smollett was lying.

The report makes it even more curious that Howard shared a heart-warming video of Smollett on Instagram on Sunday. The actor posted a short clip of Smollett holding Howard's baby son in the seat of a private jet. It was presumably taken last month when Howard visited troops at the Osan Air Base.

In the video, a smiling Smollett played with baby Hero, tickling him and prompting smiles from the little one. He chatted with Howard at the same time, asking about Hero's teething and remarking on how adorable he is.

""All your lil homies got you,"" Howard wrote of Smollett. ""We love the hell outta you.""

In spite of his arrest, Smollett and his lawyers continue to claim he is innocent. His attorneys released a public statement on Thursday condemning the Chicago Police Department's charges against Smollett.

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,"" it read. ""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.

The rollercoaster saga surrounding Jussie Smollett continues.



On the morning of February 21, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson led a press conference on behalf of the city’s police department shortly after the 36-year-old actor-singer was taken into custody. Along with Commander of Area Central Detectives Edward Wodnicki’s rundown explaining the alleged timeline of events, Johnson raised brows when he claimed the department was in possession of a $3,500 check Smollett wrote to the Osundairo brothers in order to assist him in a elaborate hoax.

I immediately wondered how someone who allegedly carried out a hoax could be so foolish to pay accomplices with the most easily trackable financial tender known to man. As if cash doesn’t exist.

Turns out, the reported check didn’t explicitly state anything about a staged attack at all.

TMZ initially posted the image of the check, which shows the check written out to Abimbola Osundario with a memo that reads, “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go).” The check was dated January 23, six days before the alleged attack occurred.

ABC News has now confirmed it has obtained a copy of said check as well as text messages between the two, relating to exercising and meal plans, which corroborates TMZ’s report.

Still, Superintendent Johnson appeared on Good Morning America Monday morning to speak with Robin Roberts, doubling-down on his press conference briefing claims that Smollett fabricated the entire attack.

“Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave,” Johnson told Roberts. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

“It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something, it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this,” he added.

Smollett turned himself into police and has posted bond, set at $100,000 at the bond hearing. He has pleaded not guilty."

Jussie Smollett’s alleged lies inflame already tense Chicago | Washington Post

“You’d have to go back to ‘The Cosby Show’ in the ’80s to find a show that’s that popular and based on the stories of black people,” said Darnell Hunt, director of the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at the University of California at Los Angeles. Smollett’s role in particular was an anomaly for network TV, where gay characters have often been relegated to the background. His presence touched off wider conversations about how homosexuality is portrayed and discussed within the black community. “He was one of the regulars, with a major role and his own story line,” Hunt said. “That’s valuable to encourage dialogues within a community that were either taboo in the past or discussed in a nonconstructive way.”

She said people may see the need to find a less risky area, but they’ll still want to be close to their social and professional networks. “Governments, policymakers and city planners are increasingly anticipating climate change in the projects that they take on and are building protective infrastructure or deciding not to fund the protection of certain areas,” Koslov said. “Their actions in anticipation of climate impacts and in response to disasters … have the potential to displace a lot of people or make places more habitable.”

Analysts scratch their heads about the missed holiday sales forecast | California Apparel News

David Shulman, a senior economist with the UCLA Anderson Forecast, agreed. He said the business school’s current forecast maintains that the U.S. and California economies will grow moderately this year and next. He predicted that the disappointing holiday 2018 numbers will be revised because the NRF gets its data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The bureau’s economists may have made errors because they were slammed with a tidal wave of information after the recent 35-day government shutdown ending Jan. 25. The announcement of holiday business results was delayed because of the shutdown, which was the longest government closure in U.S. history.

Chicago’s top cop promised on Monday that there’s “a lot more evidence” that proves Jussie Smollett staged his hate attack.

The investigation into the “Empire” star — who has been charged with filing a false police report over last month’s alleged hoax — is ongoing, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told “Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts.

“Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that does not support the version he gave,” Johnson said.

“There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply doesn’t support his version of what happened.”

Johnson also pushed back against reports that a $3,500 check Smollett gave to two bodybuilding brothers was actually payment for training sessions — not for staging the Jan. 29 attack, as police allege.

“They [the brothers] said that he paid them $3,500 with a check . . . to carry out this incident,” Johnson insisted.

The brothers — Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo — were initially arrested as suspected attackers after Smollett, who is gay, reported that he was pummeled by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs, doused him with bleach and left a noose around his neck.

But cops now allege Smollett paid to the pair to stage the beatdown.

Johnson told “GMA” that the brothers became cooperating witnesses in the “47th hour” of the 48 hours cops were allowed to hold them in custody, after speaking with their lawyer.

Meanwhile, a report said “Empire” co-star Terrence Howard had a “meltdown” on set and refused to come out of his trailer when Smollett was arrested.

Howard, who plays the father of Smollett’s character on the hit Fox drama, had been suspicious of his 36-year-old co-star’s story and screamed at him to come clean when the Osundairos, one of whom had worked on the show, were collared, TMZ reported Monday.

Smollett returned to the set that night to apologize and profess his innocence, but Howard was nowhere to be seen, the celebrity-news site reported.

Still, Howard publicly defended Smollett over the weekend, writing on Instagram: “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly.”

Also on Monday, a Chicago judge ruled that Smollett is allowed to travel to New York and California — but nowhere else — to meet with his legal team.

Smollett, who was released on a $100,000 bail, had been barred from leaving the state without permission from a judge.

His next court date is March 14."

“Let me just put this out there first and foremost right now that he still has the presumption of innocence until he has his day in court,” Johnson told host Robin Roberts on “Good Morning America” Monday.

Johnson reiterated that Smollett, 36, described the Jan. 29 incident as a hate crime and that the Chicago police treated it as such. Johnson noted that even though the actor said his two alleged attackers were masked, Smollett “was able to say he’d seen around their eyes that at least one was white-skinned.”

TMZ obtained a copy of the check to Osundairo where the memo line reads “[five] week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go).” Smollett had gained weight and wanted to get into better shape before filming a music video shirtless. The video was scheduled to be filmed on Feb. 23.

Osundairo has the video below posted to his personal Youtube account. The video features Osundairo discussing his fitness program restart after his injury last year.

The check was dated Jan. 23, six days before Smollett allegedly staged his own hate crime. TMZ also obtained the text messages between Smollett and Osundairo discussing his eating habits. On the day before the attack, Osundairo sent a message to Smollett reminding him to get in 45 minutes of cardio even though he was traveling.

Sources connected to Smollett told TMZ the $3,500 breaks down to $600-per-week for the workout plan and $100-per-week for the nutrition plan for five weeks.

Chicago Police Superintendent, Eddie Johnson, appeared exclusively on “Good Morning America” Monday to discuss the case. He told Robin Roberts “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that simply does not support his version of what happened.” (RELATED: Jussie Smollett’s Legal Team Won’t Admit He Isn’t A Victim)

Terrence Howard has spoken about his ""Empire"" co-star Jussie Smollett's recent arrest for allegedly filing a false police report and staging an assault on himself.

Howard shared a video of Smollett on his Instagram page on Saturday evening. The short video shows Smollett holding a baby on his lap, tickling him and breaking into fits of giggles. The caption reads ""All your lil homies got you...We love the hell outta you.""

Howard also responded to a fan criticizing his support of Smollett in the comments section.

""Sorry you feel that way but that's the only Jussie I know,"" he wrote. ""The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I've called my son for five years. It's God's job to judge and it's ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.""

On Fox's drama series, Howard plays Lucious Lyon, the father to Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, across the show's five seasons.

Howard is the first ""Empire"" star to comment on his co-star's arrest, while Fox said last Friday that Smollett would be removed from the final episodes of season five."

But, as he told ""Good Morning America"" host Robin Roberts on Monday, ""there's a lot more evidence that hasn't been presented yet that doesn't support the version that he gave us. There's still a lot of video evidence, physical evidence and testimony that doesn't support what he said happened.""

Meanwhile, a Chicago judge said Smollett can travel out-of-state to meet his lawyers while he’s free on bond.

Johnson told Roberts detectives still considered Smollett a victim rather and not a suspect right up until the final hour before they had to release the two brothers who were arrested in connection with the case unless they charged them.

""I refused to characterize Jussie Smollett as a suspect unless we had concrete evidence,"" Johnson said. ""The 47th hour that we had those two individuals in custody is when it changed.""

That's when Abel and Ola Osundairo, two American-born brothers of Nigerian descent who reside in Chicago and have worked on ""Empire,"" became cooperating witnesses, he said.

""We worked very closely with their lawyer, and (she) went in there to talk to them, and whatever she said to them apparently got through to them – to just tell the truth about what happened,"" Johnson said. ""And that's what they decided to do.""

That's not to say he and the detectives working the case didn't have their doubts about Smollett's story, he said.

""There were some questions (about Smollett's account of what happened),"" said Johnson, though he noted that's not unusual: ""There's always questions when people are describing incidents to us.""

He added, ""What's important for people to realize is it's not that the Chicago Police saying he did something. It's the evidence, the facts, the witnesses that are saying this.""

The key piece of evidence? A canceled check signed by Smollett, who the brothers say ""paid them $3,500 with a check ... to carry out this incident.""

Smollett's attorneys have said the check, made out to Abel Ola Osundairo, was for personal training sessions and nutrition plans.

Johnson, who says he grew up at the end of the civil rights era in one of ""the most notorious housing projects in the country,"" described the decision to use a noose in the incident as particularly offensive. Smollett had claimed two men threw a rope around his neck when he was attacked.

""The Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that. And I'm acutely aware of that,"" he said. ""But we didn't earn this particular incident, and I just refuse to let us take that shot if we have evidence of the contrary.

""I want people to understand that (filing a false police report) is a damaging thing to a city and to a police department. It's my responsibility to make sure the record gets set straight.""

There had already been very credible reports that some of Jussie's castmates hadn't wanted anything to do with him.

Now we're learning that Empire star Terrence Howard had a meltdown on set the day that Jussie turned himself in to police.

TMZ reports that the accusation that Jussie Smollett had staged his own attack sent Terrence Howard into an emotional spiral.

Apparently, Thursday was something of a disaster on set.

Sources from the set report that Terrence felt devastated and was in such a state that he refused to come out of his trailer for most of the day.

Apparently, Terrence had struggled with aspects of Jussie's story from the start.

Because he felt like aspects of the alleged attack didn't add up, he was said to have grilled Jussie on what might be described as ""plot holes.""

Clearly, Terrence did not feel a sense of relief when his worst suspicions were apparently confirmed by the Chicago Police Department.

After Nigerian brothers Abel and Ola Osundario were detained, Terrence reportedly confronted Jussie again on set.

He is described as having ""screamed"" at Jussie to ""come clean.""

We mentioned that Jussie had apologized ot his tense castmates on Thursday.

During that apology, during which Jussie maintained his innocence, Terrence was reportedly a no-show.

To be clear, Terrence was not the only co-star said to have hard feelings about Jussie.

This was why, producers say, they removed Jussie for the remainder of the season.

Jussie had the sympathies of countless people.

We all know that LGBTQ+ Americans of color are at high risk for hate crimes, which have been on the rise in recent years.

In 2017, the murders of gay men simply for being gay averaged about 1 per week. More than half of those were people of color.

The revelation that Jussie allegedly staged his own attack, for reasons that remain unclear, is heartbreaking.

Many fear that this can and will be used to discredit countless very real hate crime survivors in the future.

There are a lot of political forces who would like to see crimes against marginalized communities treated with less significance.

Curiously, Terrence's social media activity seems to indicate that he has mixed feelings about Jussie.

Over the weekend, he shared a video on Instagram of Jussie playing with Terrence's young son, Qirin.

Jussie asks how many teeth baby Qirin has, and then proceeds to tickle Qirin.

Though the video is presumably older, Terrence makes it clear that the timing of him sharing it is not a coincidence.

""All your lil homies got you..."" Terrence writes in the caption of the video. ""We love the hell outta you.""

That's a surprising show of what seems to be support.

Why the apparent change of heart?

Well, we can't speak to what's going on in Terrence Howard's mind at any given time.

He admitted to having been violent towards his ex-wife and he also claimed to have invented a new type of math.

That first thing is alarming and has caused many people to avoid watching Empire.

That second thing has caused a lot of people to just assume that he's nuts.

But it may be that Terrence, like a number of others, is unsure if he can trust the Chicago Police Department.

Why might Terrence have doubts?

Well, first of all, the Chicago PD has a troubling reputation when it comes to allegations of racist activity -- even for a metropolitan police department.

The CPD has been accused of lying to the detriment of communities of color, even to shield an alleged murderer.

Second of all, the FBI shared that they have not concluded that Jussie mailed himself the threatening message that proceeded his alleged attack.

The CPD had suggested otherwise.

While we don't suggest that anyone go jumping to conclusions, there's a lot that we still don't know."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) “racist” for claiming to have been Native American to advance her career. In the same tweet, Trump referred to her as “Pocahontas,” an appellation for which Trump himself has been criticized as racist.

AD

AD

Warren is apparently the only white person whom Trump has referred to as racist since he announced his intention to run for president. Hers was also the only example in which the target of the “racist” action wasn’t Trump.

Trump's tweet on Monday morning about Lee's speech at the Academy Awards may be the most revealing about his thinking.

Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts,etc.) than almost any other Pres! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2019

Lee's speech was a “racist hit on your President,” Trump claimed, while insinuating that the filmmaker couldn't even deliver his remarks without notes, much less read them. (Trump, of course, often uses a Teleprompter to deliver speeches — even after saying on the campaign trail that candidates shouldn't be allowed to use them “because you don't even know if the guy is smart."")

AD

You can read the “racist hit” for yourself. Lee began by noting the significance of the month and year in the struggle of African Americans in the United States and recalling his grandmother’s financial support for him even though her own mother was a slave.

AD

""We all connect with our ancestors,” he concluded. “We will have love and wisdom regained, we will regain our humanity. It will be a powerful moment. The 2020 presidential election is around the corner. Let’s all mobilize. Let’s all be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let’s do the right thing!""

Lee is advocating for Trump's defeat, clearly, and putting him on the side of “hate.” But it's not an assertion about Trump's race. Lee doesn't oppose Trump because he's white and he clearly didn't suggest that Trump should be defeated because he's white.

AD

It feels foolish to even take Trump's criticism as sincere. Trump himself has claimed that “racist” is a term that is used mostly for political ends, as he's said repeatedly.

“It’s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook,” he said in New Hampshire in August 2016. “When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument: You’re racist, you’re racist, you’re racist. They keep saying it.”

AD

""It's the last refuge of the discredited Democrat politician,” he added. “They keep going back to the same well.""

He probably believes this to some extent. There’s little indication that Trump sees racism in anything more subtle than overt expressions of racism by explicit racists.

AD

“Racism is evil,” he said after the violence in Charlottesville in 2017. (He was reading from a Teleprompter.). “And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-nazis, white supremacist and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear.”

If active hate groups (itself a seemingly malleable term for Trump) are the extent of what one believes constitutes racism, then naturally most descriptions of others as “racist” would be insincere. (It would also validate Trump’s regular claims that he’s the “least racist” person. If only Nazis and Klansmen are racist, everyone who’s not a Nazi or in the Klan is tied as least racist.) He bookended that broad condemnation, by the way, with his declaration immediately after the violence erupted that there had been “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides” and by his later comments that the group largely composed of white nationalists and neo-Nazis also included “fine people.”

AD

The tell in Trump's tweet, though, is his use of “your president.” He's not talking to everyone. He's talking to his supporters.

AD

He's telling them that opposition to him from Lee and others who'd criticize his presidency as hateful are themselves guilty of playing the race card and, under the rules of political rhetoric established by the Democrats, are therefore themselves racist.

He seems to actually believe, to some extent, that criticism of him from a black person — the apparently false Smollett allegations, Alcindor’s question, Smiley’s comments on ABC — is actually an attack on him based on race. If that’s the case, it suggests that Trump thinks black critics (or members of the media) see him and his presidency only in terms of race. The result is his leveraging the question of race for his political benefit in talking to his base — which is what he claims the Democrats always do.

AD

He's also telling his base (which is itself overwhelmingly white) how much he's done for black Americans as a way of waving away even indirect criticisms like Lee's.

AD

Trump makes the frankly ridiculous claim that he’s done more for black Americans than almost any other president because of criminal justice reform, low unemployment and tax cuts. The broad decline in black unemployment began under former president Barack Obama, of course, and the tax cuts largely benefited wealthier Americans and corporations. How does this stack up to, say, Abraham Lincoln or Ulysses Grant or Lyndon Johnson?

The success of that sales pitch can be evaluated by looking at the numbers themselves: His approval rating with African Americans was at a new low of 6 percent in January according to Gallup. More than 80 percent of black Americans see Trump as racist. Trump’s base may be convinced that he’s delivering for black Americans, but black Americans don’t seem to be.

AD

Trump's tweet was a circling of the wagons. His tweet argued to his base that Lee's criticism was inherently about race and undeservedly so.

AD

Lee was asking for Trump to be defeated while accepting an award for a film, “BlacKkKlansman,” which is about a black police officer who pretends to be a member of the KKK in order to infiltrate the group. The film’s primary villain is a man who’s worried about the organization being undermined by outsiders who disagree with its goals and may be working to destroy it."

But Johnson, who laid out the case against Smollett in his fiery press conference last week, said police have even more evidence against him to present.

""There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet,"" Johnson told Roberts, ""that does not support the version that he gave.""

On Thursday, the producers of “Empire” decided to cut Jussie Smollett from the show’s final two episodes.

While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”

They continued, “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

""Still ahead, Chicago police blasted Empire actor Jussie Smollett last week, accusing him of staging a hate crime because he was unhappy with his salary. We'll get Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's reaction to the alleged incident, next on Morning Joe.""

Well of course they were going to ask Emanuel about Smollett! The apparent hoax took place in Chicago, and has galvanized that city and the country at large for weeks.

So we settled in to watch the panel grill Emanuel on the matter.

But when the ensuing segment began, it opened with an airing of an ad Emanuel has put up, jabbing President Trump about his promise to build the wall. Okay, fine, but surely Smollett was next. Nope. They transitioned to inviting Emanuel to pontificate about who should be the Dem presidential candidate. As the segment wound down, there was no way they weren't going to get to Smollett, right? Wrong. It ended with Rahm being allowed to brag about various programs he'd instituted during his mayoral tenure: ""free"" pre-K, community college, etc.

The question arises: What happened during the commercial break between Mika's tease and the interview itself? Did Emanuel, in his tough-guy persona, perhaps inform the hosts that he would accept no questions about Smollett?

If that's what happened, Joe and Mika should have either:

Refused the request, asked their Smollett questions, and let Rahm explain live on the air his refusal to answer; or Canceled the interview, informing viewers that Emanuel was refusing to answer questions about the obvious question of the day.

Instead, Joe and Mika did neither. Had they bowed meekly to Emanuel's demand?

In addition to asking questions themselves, Joe and Mika gave Nick Confessore of the New York Times, MSNBC correspondent Kasie Hunt, and professor of African-American studies Eddie Glaude Jr. the opportunity to pose questions to Emanuel. None of them broached the Smollett story, either. Looks like the fix was in.

Final point: Not only did Mika verbally claim that Emanuel would be asked about Smollett, the show also did so with the screencap seen below."

Eddie Johnson said Monday on “Good Morning America” that he gave “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett every benefit of the doubt that he was the victim of an actual hate crime.

“I refused to let CPD characterize him as a suspect unless we had concrete evidence,” Johnson told GMA anchor Robin Roberts.

“The entire time that we investigated the incident he was treated like a victim,” Johnson said.

Johnson said that only after finding overwhelming evidence to the contrary did he take the unusual step of publicly debunking Smollett’s story, which had weighed heavy on a city with it’s own racial baggage.

“The city of Chicago has its issues, the Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that, and I’m acutely aware of that. But we didn’t earn this particular incident and I just refuse to let us have to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary. So I just want people to understand that it’s a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department, so it’s my responsibility to ensure that the record gets set straight.”

TIMELINE: The Jussie Smollett case

Johnson said Smollett’s story fell apart in earnest when the Chicago brothers he allegedly paid to stage the attack against him came clean — on the advice of their attorney — in the 47th hour they were in police custody. Investigators could only hold them for 48 hours, he said.

“We didn’t have the facts to support him being involved in it until that 47th hour, and it’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago police saying he did something, it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this.”

Smollett staged the hate crime, as well as a threatening letter sent to the offices of the Chicago studio where he worked, because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to garner sympathy and raise his public profile, Johnson alleged last week in an impassioned press conference.

Smollett became a household name as the story went viral in the days after the attack.

His downfall was equally swift. Executives at Fox announced recently that he’d been written off “Empire” — the show he’d been filming in Chicago at the time he alleged the attack Jan. 29.

Johnson said investigators also have a bounty of evidence they have yet to reveal that proves Smollett’s story is bogus.

“There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that does not support his innocence … physical, video and testimony.”

Johnson’s GMA appearance comes 12 days after Smollett appeared on the same morning television show to offer exclusive details about the two men he said yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him before punching, kicking and pouring a liquid he suspected was bleach onto him.

Smollett also claimed one of the men yelled “This is MAGA country” — a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Smollett has said he’s innocent.

He was charged last week with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report and was released from custody after posting bond."

Authorities accuse Nikki Joly, who organized a series of pro-LGBTQ events and initiatives in the socially conservative town, of intentionally setting fire to their own residence in 2017, The Detroit News reported Monday. Five pets perished in the inferno and the FBI investigated the incident as a hate crime, given that Joly had allegedly received threats prior to the fire.

But a police report indicates that Joly was looking for further publicity to advance his cause.

The arrest has shocked locals on both sides of the LGBTQ rights issue, especially in the wake of actor Jussie Smollett being accused of staging his own hate crime in order to promote his career. (RELATED: Jussie Smollett’s Legal Team Won’t Admit He Isn’t A Victim)

Joly has been celebrated in the local LGBTQ community for helping build a gay community center, organizing a gay pride parade and advocating for a municipal ordinance forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation. Joly was even named Citizen of the Year, The News notes.

“It’s embarrassing? How do you do it to the community you have put so much effort into helping?” Travis Trombley, who is homosexual, asked The News. (RELATED: Here’s. A List Of Hoax Hate Crimes In The Trump Era)

But police investigating the charge offered a possible motive.

According to a police report, referenced by the News, two members of the St. John’s United Church of Christ, where the gay community center is located, believe that Joly was anxious to generate more news about LGBTQ rights. Barbara Shelton and Bobby James say Joly was visibly disappointed that the 2017 Jackson Pride Parade and Festival did not generate more publicity — good or bad.

According to Metro News, investigator Aaron Grove, who interrogated Shelton and James, said the pair described Joly as “very deceptive” and possessing “layers of manipulation.”

Joly had just been married before the fire, and the two were the recipients of $58,000 in fundraising from supporters, Metro News noted.

Most disturbingly, it has been claimed that the staged attack was a ploy to get a pay raise. It is, of course, important to note that Smollett has not been found guilty and must be considered innocent until proven guilty. The situation does, however, raise important moral concerns about staging a hate crime and this matter will be discussed in general terms, without making any judgment about Smollett’s guilt or innocence.

On the face of it, the ethics of staging a hate crime (or any crime) are quite straightforward: it is morally wrong to do this. As such, what really remains is an examination of why it is wrong and the extent of the wrongness.

The first, and most obvious, problem is that reporting a staged hate crime wastes police resources that could be used to address crimes that have actually occurred—including real hate crimes. From a utilitarian standpoint, this creates a degree of harm equal to the resources diverted from doing real police work.

There is, of course, also the immorality of the deceit itself—the self-inflicted moral harm of becoming a deceiver and maintaining the deceit. There is also the harm inflicted on the world itself. As Merlin said, “when a man lies, he murders some part of the world.” And also some part of himself. As such, even if such a staged crime does not have a significant impact in terms of diverting police resources, it still causes moral harm.

A very serious consequence of staging a hate crime is something that Jussie Smollett himself noted: when people learn that a hate crime has been staged, they are more likely to have doubts when real victims come forward to report crimes. And, of course, each case of deceit about such a crime increases the doubt—thus making it ever more reasonable to consider that a person reporting a hate crime is lying. As such, this sort of deceit does considerable harm to all present and future victims of hate crimes.

Another consequence is that it provides ammunition to those motivated to deny that hate crimes occur and to reject the claims of victims. Even though it is not yet known that Smollett is guilty or innocent, he has already become part of the “fake victim” memes that are circulating via social media. While some people will always deny claims made by (alleged) victims in groups they dislike, a proven staged hate crime would give their claims more impact. After all, they can say “I bet that this person is lying, just like that guy who faked the attack on himself.”

What is even worse is that people who commit actual hate crimes can make use of the existence of faked crimes in their defense. They can make the argument that the alleged victim is lying about the crime—a tactic that has long been used in cases of sexual assault.

It is also worth noting that there can also be harm done to those cast as the villains in the staged crime. For example, if Smollett did stage the attack and cast his attackers as Trump supporters, then some harm has been done to them. While some might think that all Trump supporters are racist homophobes who would attack a gay black actor, this is obviously an unfair stereotype. Naturally, Trump supporters cannot claim to be the biggest victim if Smollett turns out to have staged the attack, but such a faked attack would do them some harm. As such, faking a hate crime is morally wicked and has broad consequences.

But after alleging that Smollett, who is black and gay, “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Jackson added, “I’m left hanging my head and asking, ‘Why?’ ”

Good question. Why, indeed, would an actor reportedly making $1.8 million a year stoop so low and risk it all?

GARRY MCCARTHY: SMOLLETT CASE DOES DAMAGE TO CITY IN NEED OF FRESH START

The short answer is greed; Smollett allegedly wanted a raise.

But assuming that Smollett is not completely off his rocker, there must be more to his thinking, and there is. The added element also explains much of the vicious, anything-goes turmoil roiling our nation: Smollett thought he could get away with it.

And why not? One look around America would tell him that blaming President Trump and his supporters for the worst things imaginable is the fastest way to become a celebrated victim and a hero to half the country.

And victimhood is making some people very, very rich.

Smollett could have correctly concluded that events don’t even have to be true to be solid gold. Enough people are willing to believe the worst because, hating Trump with every fiber of their being, they need the worst to be true.

The more serious the charge, the more they fantasize it will be the death knell of his presidency. That makes Trump haters easy prey for con men.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren played on their fantasies when she said the president “may not even be a free person” next year. Her words made headlines, not because she has any insider knowledge, but because her claim sent lefty hearts aflutter.

Warren, of course, is a professional con artist of long standing, so expect to see more sleight-of-hand as she seeks the Oval Office.

If police are correct, Smollett played his trick by scripting events designed to activate all the erogenous zones on the political and cultural left. His claim that his “attackers” made racist and anti-gay slurs, threatened to lynch him and declared Chicago “MAGA country,” was an immediate smash hit with his intended audience.

Overnight he became a household name as Hollywood and Democrats — excuse the repetition — embraced his story without a shred of doubt. See, see, they said, that’s Trump’s America for you.

Smollett played the Trump haters like a Stradivarius.

Their enthusiasm reflected their self-interest. Smollett’s story was tailored to fit all the corners of the narrative they’ve been selling since Trump came down the escalator in June 2015 to announce his candidacy. Smollett played the Trump haters like a Stradivarius.

He got bonus points for being the right kind of victim but the clumsy plot outlined by cops shows he lacks the gravitas of more experienced cons. Take Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director who is turning a disgraceful career-ending episode into a major pay day.

McCabe, after failing to bring down Trump, got fired for lying under oath — but now gets the star treatment on a book tour. What Trump-hating lefty wouldn’t want a piece of that action?

Perhaps Smollett fantasized he could get rich like McCabe or suddenly become a giant media star like James Comey. The former head of the FBI, Comey tarnished the bureau’s legacy for a generation, then painted himself as a victim of Trump and helped to spur the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.

For his efforts, which included a book and coming out of the closet as an anti-Trump partisan, Comey became a millionaire several times over.

Of course, Comey and McCabe didn’t exist in a vacuum. They were part of an administration that weaponized law enforcement and intelligence to boost their preferred candidate, Democrat Hillary Clinton, and destroy Trump.

Seeing how they basically got caught and still got rich, Smollett might have decided that, no matter what, he’d be rewarded, much as former top officials James Clapper and John Brennan got TV contracts after clearly abusing their official powers to play politics.

As for Clinton herself, she lost an election she should have won in a cakewalk — yet managed to launch the lie that Trump stole victory. Her lie remains an article of faith among deluded millions who believe it because they want it to be true.

But Smollett’s scheme would have made no sense unless he could count on the complete cooperation of one other player: the media. He would need them to swallow his story, then amplify it and repeat it a thousand times over.

Naturally, they did, because they, too, desperately wanted it to be true.

He hand-picked his interviewers, and played the role of his life — a defiant victim of Trump Nation. Smollett aimed to be so good and so appealing that he wouldn’t just get a raise, he’d be a mega-star and his career would take off like a rocket.

He might even have gotten a call for a starring role in Sunday’s Oscar telecast. Imagine the Hollywood elites, comfortable in their sneering disdain for Trump’s America, rising to applaud him as he appeared on stage as a stand-in for their America.

The world would watch movie stars cry real tears of admiration and sympathy. Smollett would bask in their salute, a bold, strong member of the resistance. Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.

Johnson Speaks Out On Jussie Smollett Investigation,['Elise Nelson'],https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/eddie-t-johnson-press.jpg,"['smolletts', 'conference', 'alleged', 'superintendent', 'speaks', 'eddie', 'truth', 'chicago', 'press', 'according', 'investigation', 'johnson', 'smollett', 'jussie']","Chicago is still reeling from the events of the Jussie Smollett scandal. On Monday morning, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson appeared on Good Morning America, where he re-told the story as it unfolded before the eyes of the police department. According to Johnson, the scandal came to light when Smollett’s two alleged attackers decided to tell the truth while in custody.

“The entire time we investigated, [Smollett] was treated as a victim,” Johnson explained to GMA’s Robin Roberts. “We picked up the two individuals after we identified who they were…We took them in and were legally able to hold them for 48 hours…the 47th hour that we had those two in custody is when it changed.”

Johnson continued on to explain that the two suspects at the time were encouraged by their lawyers to tell the truth of the matter. After several hours of questioning, the suspects became witnesses as they revealed that Smollett paid them to commit the alleged crime so that the actor could file a fake police report.

As those who are following the investigation know, Smollett reported that he was attacked by two men in the early hours of January 29, 2019. The Empire star claimed that two white men in ski masks approached him shouting racial and homophobic slurs before physically attacking him with a chemical substance. The alleged attackers left a noose tied around the actor’s neck, according to Complex.

As the investigation proceeded, it was soon discovered that Smollett staged the attack in protest of his low pay for his work on FOX’s Empire.

BREAKING: Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson blasted ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett in an emotional press conference in which he said that Smollett's alleged staging of a hoax attack was a ""publicity stunt...to promote his career."" https://t.co/7NKIGNKnqB pic.twitter.com/irGlsqhRIe — Nightline (@Nightline) February 21, 2019

According to Johnson, the two hired brothers presented to the Chicago police a check for $3,500 that Smollett gave them to carry out the plan.

The investigation is still ongoing, as Johnson explained that there is evidence that has not yet been presented. However, much of the evidence does not support Smollett’s version of the story. He will remain innocent until proven guilty in court, should he choose to attend.

Johnson also spoke out about the case on a more personal note. When Roberts recalled the superintendent’s passionate press conference regarding the investigation last week, Johnson said that he did feel angry and disgusted by Smollett’s act.

“I grew up in the tail end of the civil rights era…the symbol of the noose is very offensive,” Johnson said. “The Chicago police have this issue with racism, and we did not earn this incident…I just want people to understand that’s a damaging thing to do to a city.”

During last week’s press conference, Johnson frequently referred to Smollett’s act as “shameful,” according to CBS.

Johnson feels it is his duty to set the record straight on the matter for the sake of Chicago."

When champagne came surging out of the bottle, Mr. Malek hosed down the room like a grand prix winner, drenching onlookers and engravers alike.

“And that's what happens when you win an Oscar,” he added.

If the Academy Awards are the peak expression of American culture, perhaps it’s fitting they’re held in a mall. After the ceremony at the Dolby Theater, guests ascended five levels via escalator, across from stores like Victoria’s Secret and Dave & Buster’s, to the Ray Dolby Ballroom.

Inside, they were greeted by waiters bearing trays of Oscar-shaped pastries with smoked salmon and caviar, Wagyu beef bites and chicken potpies.

For one, Sen. Kamala Harris announced her presidential bid for 2020. A few days later, Empire star Jussie Smollett was the victim of an alleged hate crime before he was arrested for allegedly staging the attack on himself. With all the attention on Smollett, there are rumors that he is somehow Harris’ family. Is Jussie Smollet related to Kamala Harris? Here’s what you need to know.

Is Kamala Harris Jussie Smollett’s Aunt?

Thirty-six-year-old black and gay actor Jussie Smollett was allegedly the victim of a hate attack in January 2019. At that time, Sen. Kamala Harris had spoken in support of him and condemned the attack, calling it “modern-day lynching.”

However, Smollett was arrested for felony disorderly conduct and is facing allegations that he staged the attack on himself. This incident has become a polarizing one, with many still supporting him and others pivoting from their earlier support.

Kamala Harris was one of them who tweeted, posting a lengthy statement on February 22 that she was “sad, frustrated, and disappointed” following reports of Smollett allegedly faking the attack. She went on to say that such incidents take away from real victims and turned the focus to the issue of rising hate crimes. See the full statement below:

Like most of you, I've seen the reports about Jussie Smollett, and I'm sad, frustrated, and disappointed. pic.twitter.com/91OHOymShi — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 21, 2019

Harris’ statement has brought some unusual attention on her relation with Smollett. The lawmaker and the actor have been seen together in the public domain several times supporting the same causes. But there are now rumors of Harris’ apparent connection to Smollett.

Social media users are speculating that Smollett is Harris’ aunt. They conclude this from Smollett’s mother’s maiden name, Janet Harris.

But is this true? Not really. There’s no apparent familial connection between Harris and Smollett.

Smollett’s Mother Is Not Harris’ Sister

Jussie Smollett and his five siblings were born to Janet (née Harris) and Joel Smollett. The Smollett acting siblings are biracial with an African-American mother and a Jewish father with roots in Russia and Poland.

Kamala Harris also has mixed ethnicity. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a breast cancer scientist from India. Her father Donald Harris, an economics professor at Stanford, emigrated from Jamaica. The 54-year-old and her sister, Maya Harris, had both a black Baptist church and Hindu upbringing.

According to some satirical sites, the senator is Smollett’s aunt from his mother’s side. The reports also claim that Harris colluded with Smollett to set up the alleged hoax attack for a political agenda. These reports are, however, satire and meant to be taken with a grain of salt.

The claim that Janet Smollett is Kamala and Maya Harris’ sister is unfounded. According to some reporters, it originated from the notorious conspiracy peddling site, 4Chan.

This ""Kamala Harris is Jussie Smollett's aunt"" conspiracy was fueled from a few 4chan posts from several days ago.

It heated up because people didn't know ""nephew"" was slang. pic.twitter.com/ktAdCOlwKd — Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) February 23, 2019

There aren’t any details about Janet’s family to establish any connection, either. Besides, Harris is an extremely common last name.

Sen. Harris is reportedly of partial African descent from her father’s side. Janet Smollett hails from New Orleans and there’s no evidence of her having Jamaican roots that can be traced to Donald Harris’ family.

Meanwhile, Jussie has denied the allegations that he faked the attack. However, Empire producers announced that his character, Jamal Lyon, won’t be in the final two episodes of the season when the Fox drama returns after the mid-season break."

She called the exchange ""super-creepy and inappropriate.""

Johnson told The Post, ""I immediately felt violated because I wasn’t expecting it or wanting it ... I can still see his lips coming straight for my face.""

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders denied the allegation, saying, ""This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts.""

Johnson filed a federal lawsuit on Monday alleging that the campaign discriminated against her by paying her less than her white male counterparts.

She said she considered coming forward after Donald Trump was caught on tape bragging about kissing and grabbing women without their consent, but she was nervous about coming forward.

""I’ve tried to let it go,"" she said. ""You want to move on with your life. I don’t sleep. I wake up at 4 in the morning looking at the news. I feel guilty. The only thing I did was show up for work one day.""

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson flew all the way to “Good Morning America” to talk with Robin Roberts.

Johnson began with, ““Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

However, he then continued to talk about Jussie as if he was already guilty. He said, “It’s not the Chicago police saying [the attack was staged], it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying it.”

When Roberts asked about the $3500 check that Smollett is accused of using to pay the Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, to stage the attack, Johnson answered, “They said that he paid them $3,500 with a check … to carry out this incident.” But there are several reports that the check was for fitness training. Roberts never asked a follow-up question nor did she ask about the FBI saying they “went too far” in their press conference.

On this issue of the Chicago police not being trusted by many, especially in the Black community, Johnson replied, “But we didn’t earn this particular incident and I refuse to let us take that shot if we have evidence of the contrary … [Filing a false report] is a dangerous thing to do to a city and to a police department. Something like this can be really damaging. We made a lot of progress in the last three years in terms of race relations … I just hope people don’t judge other people that are victims of these types of crimes.”

In case you missed it, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” their case. One federal law enforcement source told TMZ, “I think he [Johnson] went too far. We’re not there yet.”

TMZ also reports, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter. Here is a copy of the Jan. 22 that was sent to Fox Studios:

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson maintains Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.'” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

TMZ also reports, “There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the ‘attack’ — Bon [Abel Osundairo] wrote, ‘I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.’ Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ‘This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.'” The $3,500 breakdown was reportedly “$600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks,” according to TMZ reports.

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett has maintained his innocence and was released on $100,000 bond. He has not been talking to the press since his “Good Morning America” interview.

The Chicago Police Department has dropped the ball from the beginning with their handling of the case in the media. First, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants. Then, hours later, there were two “persons of interest” on video. They also claimed the “Empire” actor “refused” to give the cops his phone, but he did give his phone records. Now the FBI is challenging them the Chicago Police.

They all need to stop talking until their case is laid out.

Getting to the real story

Last week, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with soliciting sex at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Florida. The charges came after authorities conducted a six-month investigation targeting massage parlors for sex trafficking.

The Kraft story made headlines across the country. It led national newscasts. New York Daily News columnist Jane McManus wrote that the NFL should ban Kraft if the charges are true. There were plenty of jokes, too.

But was the coverage warranted? Did the media go too far on this story when you consider that Kraft is charged with two misdemeanors? (Kraft, by the way, has denied the charges.) Boston’s WGBH had an excellent discussion about the coverage.

While the initial reports focused on Kraft, another story quickly emerged and the media should be commended that it has concentrated on the right part of this story. It’s less about a famous 77-year-old rich guy being accused of soliciting prostitution and more about raising awareness about sex trafficking as Jenavieve Hatch wrote for HuffPost.

Hatch writes: “The real story is the vulnerable women targeted by powerful men.”

The New York Times also weighed in on that part of the story.

Sometimes it takes a famous figure such as Kraft to draw attention to a subject that needs more scrutiny. Perhaps we will continue to see more stories such as Politico’s How To Fight Sex Trafficking than simple pot shots at Kraft, whether he deserves it or not.

This seems to be one viral story where the media shifted its focus and then kept that focus pointed in the right direction.

Most interesting quote of the weekend

The news cycle in the past few days has been dominated by the anticipation of the Mueller report and fallout of the Jussie Smollett story. One story that seems under-played is the arrest of Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Paul Hasson, a self-described white supremacist who allegedly had a hit list of prominent Democrats and journalists from CNN and MSNBC.

That led to this quote from former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Sunday’s “Meet the Press:”

“The civility in our dialogue is deviating downward such that individuals like this Coast Guard lieutenant feel emboldened and perhaps even entitled to take matters into his own hands.”

Maybe something for all of us, including journalists, to think about as we voice our political opinions.

The election’s fallout

Lydia Polgreen used to be a foreign correspondent and director of NYT Global at The New York Times. Now she’s the editor in chief at HuffPost. In an interview with the Longform podcast (credit to Nieman Lab for digging this up), Polgreen wonders what would have happened if Hillary Clinton had defeated Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

“Like a lot of people, I think I went a little bit crazy after Donald Trump got elected,” Polgreen said. “If Hillary Clinton had won the election, I have a feeling that I would still be a mid-level manager at The New York Times. But after the election, I really started to think about journalism, about my role in it, about who journalism was serving and who it was for, and I just became really enamored with this idea that you could create a news organization that was less about people who are left out of the political and economic power equations, but actually for them.”

Baquet pushes back against Trump

Last week, New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger wrote an editorial response to President Donald Trump calling the Times a “true enemy of the people.” That wasn’t the only Times response. Executive Editor Dean Baquet also pushed back against the president while accepting the 2019 Larry Foster Award for integrity in public communication at the third annual Arthur W. Page Center Awards.

Baquet said he changed his acceptance speech upon reading Trump’s tweet. In his speech, he asked the president how it’s against the interest of the people when the Times broke the Harvey Weinstein story that started the #MeToo movement or when reporters risk their lives covering wars, among other examples.

“’Enemy of the people’ is not just a tossed-off line that sounds good in a tweet,” Baquet said. “It is a particularly pernicious phrase with a deep history. … No president has ever uttered those words in public.”

Johnson also told “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts that Smollett told police “at least the one” of his assailants was a white-skinned person,” which clears up some confusion about where that part of the story came from.

Johnson drew major headlines last week when he denounced Smollett in a press conference and accused him making up a hate crime against himself. As Johnson explained the details of the case and the investigative process that was applied to Smollet’s supposed assault, he doubled down on his assessment and said there’s more evidence out there to suggest the actor’s story was fabricated.

“There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet and does not support the version he gave,” said Johnson. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence, and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

At one point in the interview, Roberts prompted Johnson to elaborate on the passion and frustration he expressed during his press conference. The superintendent said his anger was based in the notion that Smollett was using racism for personal gain, and that it was a “damaging thing” he did by falsifying the issue when the Chicago PD has real race issues to work on.

“I hope people don’t judge other folks that are victims of these types of crime. This is just one particular incident, and that’s the damaging part of it. You damage a city’s reputation where we don’t need help with that. There are real victims of crimes of that nature, hate crimes, and I just hope that people don’t treat them with skepticism.”

President Donald Trump‘s adult son was on the Fox News morning show to talk about his op-ed, for RealClearPolitics, that accused Instagram of deleting a post of his on actor Jussie Smollett for political reasons. After the post was deleted, Don Jr. said users messaged him to say they could no longer interact with his account. Instagram said in a statement that the issue was a bug that affected a “large number of people regardless of who they like or follow.”

Don Jr.’s Instagram post about Smollett mocked the actor’s story that he was attacked by two Trump supporters on a winter night in downtown Chicago.

“If they wore a MAGA hat in downtown Chicago they probably wouldn’t last too long, ok? Two seconds until you get shot,” Don Jr. explained on Fox & Friends.

Don Jr. went on to say that users messaged him to claim Instagram locked them out of their accounts for attempting to like his Twitter posts (Twitter and Instagram are different platforms).

“I had one week this summer, I called it out, I had something like 10 million organic impressions, and zero new followers. It’s statistically impossible,” Don Jr. said. “It feels like it’s a dry run, where they’re trying to suppress any kind of right-wing message, any kind of conservative message for 2020. I mean they’re just setting it up. They’re seeing how far they can get away.”

“They’re doing it already,” added Fox & Friends host Ainsley Earhardt.

Johnson said Smollett told police “at least the one” of his assailants was “a white-skinned person,” which clears up some confusion about where that part of the changing story came from. Smollett said he could see the skin color around the man’s eyes.

Johnson also said that Gloria Schmidt, the attorney for brothers Olabinjo (“Ola”) and Abimbola (“Abel”) Osundairo, was the one who convinced the men to flip on Smollett in the 47th hour of their custody. At the time, the two men, who they say were paid $3,500 to fake an assault on the actor, were persons of interest in the reported crime.

The Chicago PD investigation is ongoing, Johnson told Roberts. He reminded viewers of her ABC News morning program that Smollett still has the presumption of innocence until his day in court, “if he chooses to go that route.” Smollett is due back in court in March.

Smollett turned himself into authorities on Thursday after being slapped with a felony charge of filing a false police report. After spending a few hours in custody, he posted $100,000 bond. In a subsequent press conference, Johnson said the “Empire” star orchestrated a hate crime against himself because he was unhappy about his salary on the show.

The actor, however, has maintained his innocence, with his team releasing a statement saying Smollett “feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

On Friday, “Empire” announced that it would remove Smollett’s character from the remaining two episodes of Season 5."

Barely a day and a half after his disastrous Tulsa rally, which less than 6200 people attended, according to an official estimate, the President is clearly concerned about his re-election prospects.

Monday morning President Trump tweeted out a link to a far right wing website quoting Attorney General Bill Barr’s false claim voting by mail “absolutely opens the floodgates to fraud.”

The President added: “This will be the Election disaster of our time. Mail-In Ballots will lead to a RIGGED ELECTION!”

There is zero evidence of this.

Minutes later, Trump fired off an all-caps tweet, insisting – again without evidence – foreign countries will print “millions” of mail-in ballots, rigging the election.

In a Good Morning America interview Monday with Robin Roberts, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson claimed there was a host of more evidence suggesting that Jussie Smollett staged his January hate attack that the public had not yet seen.

“There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave,” Johnson said. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

Roberts, you’ll remember, interviewed Smollett earlier this month, and allowed him to tell his version of the events that the Chicago P.D. openly contested in a press conference last week, after Smollett had bee n officially charged with a felony for allegedly staging the attack. Smollett, through his lawyers, has denied perpetrating a hoax.

In a seeming acknowledgment of the mistrust many members of the public have for the Chicago P.D., which has a history of corruption and racism, Johnson said, “It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago police saying that he did something. It’s the evidence, the facts, and the witnesses that are saying this.”

He continued: “The symbolism of a noose [which Smollett said his attackers placed around his neck] is very offensive. The city of Chicago has this issue. The Chicago Police Department has this issue with racism and excessive force and all of that. And I’m acutely aware of that. But we didn’t earn this particular incident. And I just refuse to let us have to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary. I just want people to understand, that’s a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department, so it’s my responsibility to ensure that the record gets set straight.”"

Thanks to the hard work of the House and the Senate, the House was able to “Agree” with very few changes. The small budget will now go to the Governor and we will continue to work on the “Big” Budget.



We passed another Rural Broadband bill in Committee. This bill was a bit more contentious as the internet providers and EMC’s were still not in agreement with the cities and counties in how to access utility pole fees. HB 244 creates a standard pole rate that is identical to the federal standard pole rate. We think this bill will level the playing field in search of progress, as some cities and counties had outrageous fees, making it economically impossible to provide broadband there. This bill sat in committee for 3 years already, and we are very impatient with any further delays. Another measure, HG 243, will try to standardize fees on the installation of telephone facilities. That measure has not yet passed Committee.



I was very pleased that another of my military children bills received a unanimous vote on the floor of the House. Another Education Bill, HB 130, will create a 501(c)3 to fund public education as well as the academies for the blind and deaf.



I was also very pleased with the passage of HR 164, a resolution that states that any fees collected for a specific public purpose should be used only for that purpose. The classic example of problems of this sort is the landfill business. This legislation would require honesty and transparency that you, the hard-working taxpayer, rightfully expects.



Another resolution, HR 37, creates a Commission on Freight and Logistics. You’ve heard me say this before, but the main reason Atlanta is the capital of the South is because of transportation. The ATL is the World’s Busiest Airport and the intersection of 3 Interstate highways and many railroad lines. Savannah is the 4th busiest port in America, and the only port in the USA with both an intersection of 2 Interstate highways and the intersection of 2 major railroad lines. This Commission will seek ways to improve traffic while leveraging these economic advantages.



The most contentious bill so far is HB 316 which will decide what sort of voting machines will be used in future. This bill would require that voters use a touchscreen machine that would create a paper ballot with their vote annotated. That paper ballot would be scanned into a separate machine that would count the actual vote. That same paper ballot would then be kept on file so that in case of a problem, the ballots could easily be recounted and/or audited. The competing view is that voters should fill out a paper ballot by hand and then that paper ballot should be fed into a counting machine. The problem with this 2nd idea is that – as we saw with the embarrassing Florida recount in 2000 – paper ballots are easy to mess up.



We use touchscreens on our phones every day. Elderly and disabled people have great difficulties with paper ballots, and as former Secretary of State Cathy Cox (a Democrat) testified, paper ballots actually stifle voting because of the length of time and long lines they create.



Everyone wants to defend the sanctity of the vote. Both sides are proposing paper ballots. The only difference is whether those ballots are marked by a touchscreen machine or a person.



Finally, I want you to know that I have received numerous calls about the recent situation about the Speaker of the House. I value and appreciate your concerns, and want you to know that I and my fellow colleagues are taking the matter very seriously. While no one wants us to rush to judgement based solely on a media account – as was previously done in the past few weeks in the Covington Catholic School and Jussie Smollett incidents – we are weighing clear facts as they come in. Then we will take action if it is called for.



I hope you will continue to pray for me as I serve the people of Newton and Morgan counties. You may contact me at 706-372-4114 or davebelton112@gmail.com.

“I just want people to understand that’s a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department,” said Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson in an interview with Good Morning America.

“The city of Chicago police department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that, and I am acutely aware of that,” Johnson said. “But we didn’t earn this particular incident, and I just refuse to let us have to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary.”

“It’s my responsibility to ensure that the record gets set straight,” he added.

Smollett, who is openly gay and plays an openly gay character on Fox’s Empire, told Chicago police on Jan. 29 that he had been attacked by two masked men shouting racist and homophobic slurs, who beat him and poured chemicals over him before tying a rope around his neck. But after numerous twists and turns to the police investigation, authorities announced on Feb. 20 that Smollett would be charged with filing a false police report after evidence emerged suggesting he may have staged the attack.

The actor surrendered to police the following day. Johnson said that day that Smollett “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career” and that he acted because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.”

Smollett’s lawyers have called his arrest an “organized law enforcement spectacle,” and hinted that there was a political motivation behind it. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,” the lawyers said in a statement. Smollett had earlier denied staging the incident.

Smollett alleged a Jan. 29 hate crime attack occurred near his Chicago apartment; he said two masked attackers shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, placed a noose around his neck and poured an unknown chemical on him, several news outlets report.

Smollett and his lawyers maintain his innocence, while police stand by the charge.

The question of the attack’s validity has created political division and skepticism across the country. A matter of objectivity and finding the facts of the story surrounds the issue.

Alec Brownlow, director of the master’s program in Sustainable Urban Development at DePaul, said the case is complicated and that the public has been pretty divided about the validity of the story. Brownlow said he is attuned to the case and is awaiting information.

“The political right is pretty much taking the stand that this is a stunt to embarrass the president in the ‘Make America Great Again’ calls,” Brownlow said. “But even on the left, there seems to be growing doubt or suspicion about the validity of the claim.”

Brownlow said Smollett’s credibility is taking a blow, and the report has affected people’s perception of Smollett.

This story could also affect Chicago’s reputation, Brownlow said. He said Chicago already is known to be a dangerous place where gun violence is rampant and the city is understood as both violent and segregated.

“I think Chicago already has the reputation within the wider American public as a fundamentally dangerous place,” Brownlow said. “When this story first came out, it took both of those realities, both of those perceptions, ‘Chicago is violent, Chicago is racist’ and just amplified the relationship between the two.”

Brownlow said that he would not be surprised if there were powers actively feeding the opposite story; that the incident was made up. He said he has no doubt the city, its businesses and political leaders were hoping the story is false, because if it were true, it would be a black eye on Chicago.

“The fact that Jussie is young, the fact that Jussie is gay; those are two demographics that cities market themselves to,” Brownlow said. “They want young people to come to their cities.”

John Brehm, a professor of political science at University of Chicago, said political candidates such as Sen. Kamala Harris have been speaking out in support of Smollett, which may damage their credibility if the statement is false.

“If presidential candidates [prejudge] events before the facts were out, then that’s not a positive report on their own candidacies,” Brehm said.

Harris has since released a statement expressing her disappointment with the charge of Smollett falsifying the hate crime, news outlets report.

“You have a political divide already, and then you become attentive to the facts that you use to justify your own beliefs,” Brehm said, describing it as motivated cognition.

Brehm said people selectively pay attention to facts in order to reinforce their public statements about their beliefs.

Jeremy Gorner, a crime reporter for the Chicago Tribune who has been covering the incident, said reporters have to follow the facts that are present, such as police reports and statements from lawyers.

Gorner said as reporters, it is important for news outlets to be careful to report what is factual, in order to get the story fully correct. It seems like a rat race for news outlets to be the first ones to report the story, he said.

“Despite all the skepticism that’s out there, I think as reporters, we are at the mercy of reporting what we know instead of what a lot of people think,” Gorner said.

Gorner said police investigations can change.

“What may appear to be one thing early on in the investigation may not appear to be the same thing as the investigation progresses,” Gorner said.

It is clear that there has been a change in the investigation now that Smollett has been charged.

Brehm said the incident will probably be a controversy for some period of time, but it won’t last long.

Prior to the police announcing the charge against Smollett, Brehm said it would be an unfortunate situation either way because of the connotations from both sides.

“If it turns out that it was a hoax, then it’s unfortunate that this individual feel the need that he needs to provoke public attention to him,” Brehm said. “If it turns out not to be a hoax, then it’s a pretty awful statement about how African-Americans or gay individuals are being by the public or by total strangers. Either way, that’s not a happy outcome.”"

Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson appeared on Good Morning America on Monday to defend the Chicago Police Department's investigation into the attack and double down on his condemnation of Smollett.

He batted away the Empire actor's claim that a check for the brothers he allegedly paid to attack him was for personal training and said there was surveillance footage. physical evidence and testimony that proves it was a hoax which is yet to be presented.

'He still has the presumption of evidence and he'll get his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route,' Johnson said, rejecting Smollett's lawyers claim that he has been unfairly vilified by the police department and prosecutor's office.

'I can tell you this, there's a lot more evidence that has not been presented yet that does not support his version of the incident.

On Monday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson appeared on Good Morning America to say he had more proof the actor lied

Chicago police Superintendent on the Jussie Smollet investigation, “I just want people to understand that’s a damaging thing to do to a city.” https://t.co/G4P92ohuFL pic.twitter.com/5idKkrG80f — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 25, 2019

'There is still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that simply does not support his version.

'It's not the Chicago PD saying he did something. It's the evidence, the facts and the witnesses saying this,' he added.

Johnson, who eviscerated the Empire star during a press conference last week after he was arrested, said he was careful throughout the investigation not to jump to the conclusion that Smollett was involved despite growing suspicion among detectives.

Jussie Smollett is shown in his mugshot on February 21. He maintains he is innocent

'I refused to let Chicago Police Department categorize him as a suspect until we had solid evidence,' he said.

Johnson also said he was 'acutely aware' of the police department's reputation for being racist, which Smollett supporters have invoked in their defense of him, but that it played no role in this investigation.

'Something like this can be really damaging. We have made a lot of progress in the last three years in terms of race relations.

'We're heading in the right direction in terms but are we where we want to be? Of course not,' he said.

Johnson added that he did not want Smollett's case to act as a deterrent to true victims of hate crimes, saying: 'This is just one incident...there are real victims of crimes of that nature, hate crimes, and I just hope people don't treat them with skepticism.

'This is one particular incident and it has to stand on its own merits,' he said.

'The City of Chicago has its issues. The CPD has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that and I am acutely aware of it.

'[But] we didn't earn this incident and i refuse to let us have to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary.

'It's my responsibility to make sure the record gets set straight.'

He added that it was 'offensive' that Smollett included the claim that a noose was put around his neck by his attackers in his story, given its significance as a symbol of racism.

'I grew up in the tail end of the civil rights era... the symbolism of a noose is very offensive,' he said.

After his arrest last week, the Cook County State's Attorney's office revealed some of the evidence it had against Smollett at an extraordinary press conference in court.

Abel and Ola Osundairo told police Smollett paid them to attack him and that he was also behind the letter he received on January 22

It included phone records which show Smollett called Abel Osundairo, one of the brothers involved, an hour before the attack, an hour afterwards and while they were in Nigeria days later.

They say they also have surveillance footage of Smollett with the brothers in the days before the attack, while they were allegedly piecing it together.

On February 13, Roberts sat down with Smollett to discuss the incident.

At the time, he was still being treated as a victim by police but there was growing suspicion within the police department over his alleged involvement in the attack.

He angrily denied making up any part of his story and cried to Roberts that he was being attacked, both on the night of the attack and afterwards, because he hates President Trump.

Smollett arrived two-and-a-half hours late to that interview and offered no explanation for it, DailyMail.com revealed last week.

This is the bond proffer that was made public last week which lays out the proof police say they have. According to Superintendent Johnson, there is more that they have not yet presented

The actor is due back in court on March 14 to face a felony charge of filing a false police report.

He is accused of paying brothers Abel and his brother Ola $3,500 to attack him at 2am on January 29.

Police say Smollett orchestrated the attack because he thought it would boost his celebrity profile, which it did, and earn him a raise.

The 36-year-old star's attorneys insist he is innocent.

Part of his defense is that the check was for personal training. It was backdated to January 23 and on it, Smollett wrote that it was for program to help him lose weight ahead of a music video appearance, writing in the memo box '5 week nutrition workout plan.'

Smollett's cast mates are split in their opinion of what happened.

Some, including his on-screen father Terrence Howard, believe he is innocent whereas Gabby Sidibe, Smollett's one-time room mate, deleted a supportive Instagram post in which she said she believed him after his arrest."

In a surprise, Green Book won last night’s Academy Award for Best Picture. Rami Malek and Olivia Colman won for Best Actor and Best Actress in a Leading Role; Mahershala Ali and Regina King won for Best Actor and Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

For everyone who won an Oscar, last night’s ceremony was a pinnacle moment that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.

For the rest of us, however, the transience of awards like last night’s Oscars is noteworthy. Who won last year for Best Actor? Best Actress? Best Picture? Who won the year before that?

We’ve already had the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild Awards, the Critics’ Choice Awards, and the Grammys. Do you remember who won what? We could ask the same question about past winners of the Super Bowl, the World Series, the Stanley Cup, and so on.

There’s a reason our culture pays so much attention to short-lived successes.

“Wealthy, successful and miserable”

Richard Rorty was one of America’s most influential thinkers. The longtime Princeton and Stanford professor was a leading voice for the relativism that has captured our culture. He claimed: “There is nothing deep down inside us except what we have put there ourselves.” He added that “truth is what your contemporaries let you get away with.”

If we reject the supernatural, the only prism by which to see the world is the natural. And the natural cannot see beyond itself. Like rose-colored glasses that turn everything rose-colored, we assume that all we see is all that exists.

As a result, many live for the moment, for the accolades of the present, because, to them, that’s all there is. But this materialistic, secularistic way of living is not sufficient for our souls.

Nine previous Oscar winners later committed suicide. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, stands accused of soliciting prostitution in Florida. Jussie Smollett’s character has been cut from this season’s final two episodes of Empire.

Writing for the New York Times Magazine, Harvard MBA graduate Charles Duhigg notes that many of his fellow graduates are “wealthy, successful and miserable.” One told him, “If you spend 12 hours a day doing work you hate, at some point it doesn’t matter what your paycheck says.” Many have “an underlying sense that their work isn’t worth the grueling effort they’re putting into it.”

Speaking of the Fall, C. S. Lewis observed: “What Satan put into the heads of our remote ancestors was the idea that they could ‘be like gods’—could set up on their own as if they had created themselves—be their own masters—invent some sort of happiness for themselves outside God, apart from God. And out of that hopeless attempt has come nearly all that we call human history—money, poverty, ambition, war, prostitution, classes, empires, slavery—the long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy.”

When secularization begins

Living for the present to the exclusion of the eternal is a temptation for God’s people as well.

Jesus’ disciples saved their lives by forsaking their Lord in the Garden of Gethsemane. Ananias and Sapphira lied about their charitable gifts to gain the acclaim of their community (Acts 5:1–11). Peter bowed to the Judaizers when he sided against Gentile Christians in Antioch (Galatians 2:11–14).

Francis Schaeffer: “I believe that pluralistic secularism, in the long run, is a more deadly poison than straightforward persecution.”

When we seek to serve the world more than our Lord, we fail to serve either. We lose what is distinctive about our faith and appealing to many in our lost culture.

Historian Christopher Henry Dawson: “The process of secularization arises not from the loss of faith but from the loss of social interest in the world of faith. It begins the moment men feel that religion is irrelevant to the common way of life and that society as such has nothing to do with the truths of faith.”

“Jesus Plus Nothing Equals Everything”

Temporal success does not guarantee significance. Job’s so-called friends judged his character by his circumstances (cf. Job 22) and faced the wrath of God as a result (Job 42:7–9).

Long life does not guarantee significance. Joseph lived a shorter life than any of his brothers (Genesis 50:26), but whose life was more significant?

Popularity does not guarantee significance. When Jesus cast a demon from a man, his critics claimed: “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons” (Luke 11:15).

What, then, guarantees significance?

John Maisel is a former football star, Purple Heart-decorated Vietnam War veteran, and successful businessman. He founded East-West Ministries in 1993 to reach the most unreached people in the world. East-West has now planted more than 171,000 churches in nearly fifty countries. John has been one of the most significant mentors in my life over the last three decades.

Dr. Mac Pier’s terrific new book about John captures his surrendered heart: All In: Jesus Plus Nothing Equals Everything. I was invited to take part in a luncheon last Friday that was planned to premiere the book by honoring John’s long ministry.

However, the guest of honor intervened. He insisted to me and to everyone who had a role in the luncheon that the focus was not to be on him, but on Jesus. He told our gathering: “Yesterday is history; tomorrow is mystery; today is all there is.” Then he challenged us to go “all in” for Jesus today.

Are you “all in”?

Votes were cast, civic duties were fulfilled, people walked during a curfew, business thrived in VGC, Tiwa Savage slayed voting, stupidity led to the loss of lives, and fake news filled our stomachs with the lies of a mess.

It was a true election day; the fires of news turned to ash in the face of consumption. We lived it again, as some bemoaned the ‘good man’ that erstwhile Nigerian President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan was – whatever that means. To all these happenings, there was a constant, aided by the infinity of internet and electricity – if your EDC decided to not be Baba Sala.

Social media – especially Twitter ­– and to a lesser extent, Facebook served you the cuisine of news like a romantic partner; in the comfort of your bed and sometimes made you the judge of distilling authe news from the very fake news circulating the cyberspace.

While social media aided the circulation of news, one sometimes had to intellectually distill truth from bad. It was so bad that authentic news was passed off by yours truly because they seemed too authoritative in thick of sensitivity.

Social media, as the platform of election day-news, could not be trusted because propaganda constantly cohabits with truth online, thus mans had to stay en guarde. It was hard, it was tough – a spectator also had to assume the role of a judge and distillery to not become a propaganda machine by himself.

Heavy hitters like Google and Facebook, which play a key role in promoting news to the larger public continue to play that key role in shelving fake news, it has gotten increasingly high as modes of verification are harder than believing Jussie Smollett.

The bias of political affiliations took on a showcase as spectators looked on, while being unable to tell fact from lies. While a simple charge to ‘do better’ would be the go-to-guy in these situations, it is a cliche we have employed many-a-time only to see even men in high places become propaganda machines for cheap politicking.

Chief Femi Fani-Kayode was a key vehicle that pushed the 'Jubril Al Sudaini' narrative.

It is a good watch for the average Nigerian in-the-know; for him to shake his head at the aggressive onslaught of politically inclined individuals to sway voters by hook or by crook. But for the average Nigerian without the ability to tell the difference, he feeds his gang at the newspaper stand a wad of lies he copped of social media.

This continues to harm truth in our country; the definition of truth continues to be warped, catering to the bias of spectators who take and believe their version of truth, sometimes at the expense of actual truth. The resulting harm this does is that people defend lies even with more lies.

The risk is not borne by the informed Nigerians, but by the millions of uninformed Nigerians. They then argue the actual truth when it comes along. In moments like this, one envies the Chinese principle that controls what circulates on the internet and even in media. Things like this are either too reduced a reality to happen or simply extinct as a matter of practice.

What we currently experience in Nigeria is a product of expression of Fundamental Rights - we can never call that a luxury, but what happens when we continue to abuse our freedom at the expense of what a nation deems overwhelming truth for our selfish ends? The power of collective responsibility guaranteed by the Constitution continually gets abused.

Do we not deserve these rights?

We actually deserve our rights. In fact, Fundamental Human Rights should simply be granted - it’s not a conversation of deserving or not deserving it. The right to express freely is God-given and natural.

All things are definitely prone to abuse, but when these rights are being abused for cheap lies and questionable ends, we have to draw a line.

Should the internet then be limited?

A while back, there were rumours that the freedom of Nigerians to express was going to be somehow limited by the government of the day and we rightly kicked up a fuss. After all, we do not live in communism.

With the way we’re going, one fears that we might soon exhaust our bandwidth of freedom of expression, but to every concept comes a disadvantage and this; what we currently witness with fake news on the internet is the downside of freedom of electronic expression.

While this downside is quite unsavoury, we must live with it and sleep with it. A limitation on our rights to express will be a problem long term as a people. What we must do now is again listen to the cliche - let us all be responsible with what we express as 'fact' on social media.

But that, my folks, is a long shot. The re are no guarantees that this charge will work."

“I can tell you this, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that does not support the version he gave,” Johnson told “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts on Monday. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply doesn’t support his version of what happened.”

Johnson said Smollett told police “at least the one” of his assailants was “a white-skinned person,” which clears up some confusion about where that part of the changing story came from. Smollett said he could see the skin color around the man’s eyes.

Johnson also said that Gloria Schmidt, the attorney for brothers Olabinjo (“Ola”) and Abimbola (“Abel”) Osundairo, was the one who convinced the men to flip on Smollett in the 47th hour of their custody. At the time, the two men, who they say were paid $3,500 to fake an assault on the actor, were persons of interest in the reported crime.

The Chicago PD investigation is ongoing, Johnson told Roberts. He reminded viewers of her ABC News morning program that Smollett still has the presumption of innocence until his day in court, “if he chooses to go that route.” Smollett is due back in court in March.

Smollett turned himself into authorities on Thursday after being slapped with a felony charge of filing a false police report. After spending a few hours in custody, he posted $100,000 bond. In a subsequent press conference, Johnson said the “Empire” star orchestrated a hate crime against himself because he was unhappy about his salary on the show.

The actor, however, has maintained his innocence, with his team releasing a statement saying Smollett “feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

On Friday, “Empire” announced that it would remove Smollett’s character from the remaining two episodes of Season 5."

According to TMZ, when Smollett turned himself in and was arrested for allegedly staging a hate crime against himself last week, Howard, who plays his onscreen father, had a meltdown on the set of the Fox series.

Sources tell the outlet that Howard was so upset that he refused to come out of his trailer for a majority of the day, which sent the set into disarray. In addition, Terrence reportedly never believed Jussie’s story and allegedly grilled him when holes in his account of the attack began to show.

The source went on to state that things got heated between Howard and Smollett after brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo were detained by police for allegedly helping Jussie stage the attack. Terrence reportedly confronted Jussie and screamed at him to come clean about the incident.

In addition, Howard was reportedly not in attendance on Thursday when Smollett was released from police custody on bail and then headed to the Empire set to address the cast and crew.

Meanwhile, other members of the cast and crew were reportedly in agreement with Terrence and wanted Jussie removed from the set for the final episodes as things were too disruptive.

However, following the alleged meltdown on set, Terrence Howard took to his Instagram account on Saturday to share a sweet video of Jussie Smollett playing with his son. The message was one of support and the caption read, “All your lil homies got you…We love the hell outta you.”

Currently, Smollett will not return to set to film the final episodes of the season for Empire, and it’s unclear whether he’ll ever come back to the show. It seems that Fox is waiting to see how the situation plays out before making any big decisions or announcements. However, The Inquisitr reports that there have already been talks of recasting Jussie’s character, Jamal Lyon.

“While these allegations are very disturbing. We are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” the network said in a statement.

Through all of the controversy, Jussie has maintained his innocence.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” a statement from Jussie’s legal team read, following his arrest.

Jussie Smollett has yet to speak out about his Empire co-stars or his future with the show."

Many are still trying to decipher Jussie Smollet’s investigation. The Empire actor was indicted arrested this past week for filing a false police report, after his alleged attack in Chicago last month. Despite the removal of his character for the remainder of the show’s 5th season, Terrance Howard is standing by his side. Howard plays Lucious Lyon, who is the father of Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon.

Howard posted a video on Instagram of Smollet playing with a child, who seems to be Howard’s son. He captioned the post, “All your lil homies got you. We love the hell out you.” He continued by firing back at critics.

“Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Fox issued its most recent statement after Smollett’s arrest. “We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.

We’ll continue to watch and see if he can garner more support from his other co-stars. As of now, Terrance Howard is the first Empire co-star to comment on Smollett’s investigation."

Kamala Harris (D-CA), is the aunt of ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett.

The radio host repeated information he heard from Q-Anon conspiracy online websites. He said:

So there’s this…It now turns out…Kamala Harris is Jussie Smollett’s aunt. As in his mother’s sister. Which in her several photo-ops on the story to date she has yet to reveal.

The conspiracy theory stem’s around the maiden name of Jussie Smollett’s mother which happens to be “Harris.”

Sahil Kapur from Bloomberg News stated that Harris has a sister named Maya, and it is not Smollett’s mother.

Other political pundits and right-wing journalists have also discussed the theory that there is a connection between Smollett and Harris. After McCullough deleted the tweet, he tweeted twice on Feb. 23:

I wonder if Harris claiming Smollett’s ‘attackers’ were a ‘modern day lynching’ has to do with why @BernieSanders is now kicking her backside in NewHampshire polling? It’s meant — to demonstrate the left’s entirely one-sided worldview openly. Harris left up an inflammatory tweet for 23 days that effects public safety, crime, and millions of dollars in police costs. Harris’ supporters have meltdowns over rumors that are up for two hours.

People responded to McCullough’s conspiracy theory by taking to Twitter.

Brent Whittington from Cornhill responded replied by asking him if that tweet was meant to defend his previous allegations which were false. He added:

None of which satisfies the assertion of any direct relationship you have alleged. Please try to stay on the original topic. You have demonstrated another right-wing conspiracy which was created to inflame fools with lies, in the hopes of making them feel good. You have muddled your point unless it was to fool fools.

Another Twitter response from Brendan Williams @BrendanWiliams said:

You know it was just an honest mistake. Republicans have always assumed all black people know each other. It is some friendly Midwest racism. It is like a compliment.

Smocky @SmockyTubers wrote on Twitter:

Is that GOP guy from NC Kamala Harris’ long lost brother too?

Andy Schwarz @andyhre tweeted:

It turns out Harris, County Texas (Houston) is also named for Kamala Harris!

Dr. Emm @NoOneNowheresv1 said:

I did not know Harris is such an uncommon name. This could be quite the scoop.

Many people noted the racism of the conspiracy theory and how it was similar to the birther claim which was discussed about President Obama. MSNBC’s Joy Reid tweeted a warning. She said this is only going to be the beginning of what we will see in 2020.

It's pretty clear that whatever his merits as an actor (I wouldn't know, having never watched Empire), he is not too bright, what with paying his conspirators by check. So that raises the question of whether or not he thought up the script for his staged attack on his own. Now comes word via TMZ :

[Mandatory disclaimer: Jussie Smollett, like all defendants, is entitled to the presumption of innocence in his forthcoming trial[s]. The following analysis is based on the assumption that the evidence presented by assistant state's attorney Risa Lanier is valid and that the charges against him are true. Registered voters in Cook County, who are members of his potential jury pool, are strongly cautioned that reading further may make them ineligible to sit in judgment of him at trial.]

Jussie Smollett might have gotten the idea to stage his own attack after Lee Daniels talked about his cousin getting assaulted because he's gay ... at least that's what some members of the ""Empire"" cast think. Sources close to the ""Empire"" production tell TMZ ... some cast members think Jussie's gears started grinding in his head days after Lee posted a video on Instagram on January 10 calling out homophobia. In that same post, the ""Empire"" creator captioned it, ""This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories."" Our sources say Lee then showed up to the set and shared more about the story. Everyone was visibly upset that Lee's family had gone through this horrific ordeal. The sources now say this might have been where Jussie got the idea to take matters into his own hands ... and become an LGBT hero.

This highly manipulative maneuver worked — at first. In a story dated January 29:

Lee Daniels is speaking out in defense of Jussie Smollett, and nearly broke down in tears while telling the star he did not deserve to have a noose put around his neck. The ""Empire"" co-creator just took to social media after Smollett was brutally attacked in an alleged homophobic and racial tirade. ""You didn't deserve this,"" Daniels says, adding, ""Nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck ... to have bleach thrown on you.""

But since the fraud was exposed, Daniels and many others involved with the show have changed their tunes. Via TMZ on February 22:

We're told many of the ""Empire"" actors are ""f‑‑‑‑‑‑ furious"" and feel if FOX honchos don't fire Jussie, he should quit on his own ... because he doesn't deserve a spot on the hit show. The feelings of animosity stem from the fact everyone on set had Jussie's back after the ""attack,"" but in light of the new evidence police have laid out ... many of them feel hurt and embarrassed. We're told almost everyone on set is worried about how Smollett's damaged the show's reputation ... and could continue to do so if he remains part of the cast. Now, our sources say there are still some cast and crew members who believe Jussie's telling the truth because they can't fathom him pulling off a hoax like this. We're told arguments have erupted over how best to handle the situation.

HipHopDX.com:

Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer all signed off on the order to cut Smollett for the remainder of the season in the wake of his arrest for allegedly grand scheming his racist attack.

Until he decides to fess up instead of denying that he staged the attack, we probably won't know the source of inspiration for the script he wrote and enacted with his two associates. But choosing the scenario in hope of manipulating his boss just makes the fraud all the more craven.

I still think his allegations that Trump-supporters were responsible was a feature, not an incidental detail. He was manipulating Hollywood and political figures, like his good friend Kamala Harris and virtually everyone who spoke about politics at the Oscars last night, by pandering to their hatred of the president and his supporters.

As this story develops, who will be left defending Jussie? His family? Isn't it time for intervention by those who love him out of blood ties?"

“Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts,etc.) than almost any other Pres!,” Trump tweeted.

The Trump tweet came just minutes after a “Fox & Friends” segment mentioning Lee’s Oscars moment, calling on voters to “mobilize” ahead of the 2020 election.

Lee snagged the first competitive Oscar win in his long career for his adapted screenplay for the drama “BlackKklansman.” He ended his acceptance speech with a pointed shot at Trump, urging those watching to vote him out of office.

“The 2020 presidential election is around the corner. Let’s all mobilize. Let’s all be on the right side of history,” Lee said, making no mention of Trump by name. “Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let’s do the right thing! You know I had to get that in there.”

Lee was referring to his 1989 movie “Do the Right Thing!” which lost the Best Picture Oscar to “Driving Miss Daisy.” Despite the screenplay win on Sunday, Lee similarly lost out on in the Best Director and Best Picture categories, which went to “Roma” director Alfonso Cuarón and “Green Book,” respectively.

In his speech, Lee also noted that his win came in February, “which also happens to be the shortest month of the year, which also happens to be Black History month.”

And he described how he and his ancestors had worked to overcome the legacy of slavery in the U.S. “Our ancestors were stolen from Mother Africa and bought to Jamestown, Virginia, enslaved. Our ancestors worked the land from can’t see in the morning to can’t see at night,” he said.

“My grandmother, Zimmie Shelton Retha, who lived to be 100 years young, who was a Spelman College graduate even though her mother was a slave,” he said. “My grandmother who saved 50 years of Social Security checks to put her first grandchild — she called me Spikie-poo — she put me through Morehouse College and NYU grad film.”

–Chicago police chief claims brothers confirmed Jussie Smollett check was payment for the attack—

“I’ve heard much about anti-lynching on the floor of this very Senate, where people were not given any due process whatsoever, and we rue that,” Fairfax said.

“And we talk about hundreds, at least 100 terror lynchings that have happened in the Commonwealth of Virginia under those very same auspices. And yet we stand here in a rush to judgment with nothing but accusations and no facts and we decide that we are willing to do the same thing.”

Fairfax was speaking against the two alleged victims who have said the Lt. Gov. sexually assaulted them and the many subsequent calls for his resignation.

Del Todd Gilbert, Republican House Majority Leader, called Fairfax’s comments about lynchings highly inappropriate, the Daily Mail reports.

“That is the worst, most disgusting type of rhetoric he could have invoked,” Gilbert said.

“It’s entirely appropriate for him to talk about due process and we would intend to offer him every ounce of it, and he’s welcome to take advantage of that anytime he would like.”

Dr. Vanessa Tyson, a tenured professor at Scripps College, has accused Fairfax of sexual assault at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. And Meredith Watson has come forward to claim he assaulted her during spring break in 2000 at the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity house, where they were both students at Duke University.

–Poor People’s Campaign to hold bus tours of poverty areas—

Republicans are scheduled to hold a public hearing this Friday where Fairfax, Tyson and Watson can testify, but the Lt. Gov doesn’t plan to participate, according to reports."

During a live press conference that went international, Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson claimed Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers $3,500 to help stage his hate beatdown in the middle of the night. Chicago’s top cop based this on a check showing the amount was made payable from the “Empire” star’s account to one of the men, Abimbola Osundairo.

But according to the brothers’ testimonies before a grand jury prior to the indictment, the check also has “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go)” written in the memo line, TMZ reported on Sunday morning, Feb. 24, 2019.

The payment, therefore, was for the brothers to help Smollett get into shape for a music video for his single, “Don’t Go.”

Smollett, who weighs about 192 pounds, admired the brothers, who are bodybuilders as well as paid extras on the “Empire” show. He wanted to develop a six-pack stomach much like the ones the brothers have. Smollett also wanted to lose 20 pounds for the video, because he was supposed to appear shirtless in it.

There’s more. Smollett’s had a series of texts to and from “Bon” that began on Jan. 20, which outlined a healthy meal plan including chicken thigh, Starkist tuna, eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter and various fruit.

“This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss,” Abimbola texted Smollett, according to TMZ.

Another text, dated Jan. 28, hours before the attack, “Bon” wrote to Smollett: “I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.”

The $3,500 breaks down like this: $600 a week for five weeks of the workout plan and $100 a week for the food plan, also for five weeks, TMZ reports.

There is another text that shows the “Don’t Go” music video was scheduled to be filmed on Feb. 23. Meanwhile, a screenshot from Venmo shows Smollett had paid “Bola” $100 on Sept. 27 for “training.”

Both brothers testified before a grand jury telling prosecutor Kim Foxx that the payment was for training.

Also, while the FBI is still investigating the hate mail scandal, an insider at the bureau said Smollett may not have mailed the hate letter to himself, according to Complex magazine. In fact, the FBI said the Chicago police superintendent spoke too soon when he publicly accused Smollett of this particular crime."

Jussie Smollett will not appear in the final two episodes of ‘Empire’, the show’s executive producers have said.

In a statement, they said the past few weeks had been “incredibly emotional” for the team.

They called allegations that Mr. Smollett had falsely claimed he was the victim of a hate crime “disturbing”.

The 36-year-old African-American actor is accused of filing a fake police report claiming he was the victim of a homophobic and racist assault.

Police say he staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied” with his salary.

In the statement, the Fox production team said, “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show, and to avoid further disruption on set we have decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season.”

It is not clear whether Mr. Smollett will return to the show in future seasons.

US media reported that the actor was seen at the studio where ‘Empire’ is filmed on Thursday afternoon.

Sources told NBC and CNN Mr. Smollett apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence.

Mr. Smollett is accused of paying two brothers to stage the attack. Chicago officials also believe that he sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand. At an earlier hearing, a judge set the actor’s bail at $100,000 (£76,000).

Mr. Smollett, who was pictured outside the courthouse after posting bail, denies the charge of felony disorderly conduct.

His lawyers have said they will “mount an aggressive defence” of Mr. Smollett, who they described as “a young man of impeccable character”.

What Did He Say Had Happened?

Mr. Smollett said two white men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him when he went out late at night to buy food from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago on January 29.

He said they then punched him, poured a potentially chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck – a reference to racist lynchings of African-Americans.

He also claimed the men said “this is Maga country” during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, ‘Make America Great Again’."

The Investigation

Smollett had claimed that two masked men attacked him on Jan. 29 while he walking to his apartment. They allegedly hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck.

But Chicago investigators said they found holes in Smollett’s story. They had video of Smollett walking away from the two alleged assailants and also video of him with a rope around his neck but no footage of the actual attack.

The Osundairo brothers, the two men at the center of the investigation into the alleged assault against Smollett, spoke out last Monday for the first time.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump,” they said. “We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”"

Hate Crime Hoaxes: The Bad and the Good

Jussie Smollett, ""Empire"" actor, claimed that on Jan. 29, two masked men identifying themselves as Donald Trump supporters and using racial and homophobic insults attacked him. Smollett said the assailants yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" bashed his face, crushed his ribs, splashed him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. Smollett's telling of the hate crime was gobbled up hook, line and sinker by the anti-Trump news media, but Chicago police say it was a hoax. This type of hoax is part and parcel of the left's broad agenda of victimology, fraudulence and gimmickry, plus gross media gullibility, incompetence and political attention seeking. What's so troublesome is the fact that despite considerable evidence that the incident was a hoax, no apologies have been issued to either the public or the targets of their malfeasance -- President Trump and the Americans who voted for him.

Racial hoaxes have been a major part of the leftist agenda going back decades. In 1987, the Rev. Al Sharpton created the Tawana Brawley hoax, wherein four white men were falsely accused of rape. For perpetrating the hoax, Sharpton was rewarded by receiving national recognition, millions of dollars and a career as a television/radio talk show host, and he ran for president in 2004. He also received 82 invitations to advise Barack Obama's White House on matters of race.

Most of the nation's racial hoaxes take place on college campuses. Recall the 2006 Duke lacrosse rape case, in which three affluent white male Duke students were falsely accused of raping a black female stripper. Police exposed Bowling Green State University student Eleesha Long as a liar after she complained about being attacked by Trump supporters the day after his election. At Goucher College in Maryland, scrawlings depicted swastikas and also spelled out the N-word and the names of four black students -- including the perpetrator. The Maryland police found out that the perp was a 21-year-old black lacrosse player seeking victimhood. Nonetheless, the incident led to protests, demands for designated safe spaces and demands that incoming freshmen and transfers be required to take a ""cultural competency"" course.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has compiled some of the most outrageous hate crime hoaxes since Trump was elected (http://tinyurl.com/y2xcc3co). The hate crime hoaxes include claims of attacks on Muslim men and women by Trump supporters. A bisexual woman falsely claimed that Trump supporters were sending her nasty notes. Most of the hate crime hoaxes have been committed by black students. Their charges include the posting of KKK signs, the sending of racist notes and the writing of racist graffiti on a black person's door with the words ""Go Home N----- Boy"" and ""Whites Only."" A black man was caught on camera spray-painting doors and vehicles with racial slurs, vulgar words and swastikas.

Even professors create hoaxes. Indiana State University professor Azhar Hussain sent bogus anti-Muslim emails to himself, according to police, ""trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself."" He was arrested for filing a false police report.

Here's the good news about the racial hoaxes on the nation's college campuses: Left-wing college students have a difficult time finding the actual racism they claim permeates college campuses. Thus, they have to invent it. Though it has not been proved yet, these students may have support for their racial hoaxes by diversity-crazed administrators, who nationwide spend billions of dollars on diversity and a multiculturalist agenda. Racial discord and other kinds of strife are their meal tickets.

Black people, as well as homosexuals, should condemn these hoaxes, but so far, most have remained silent. If police are right that Smollett's claims were a dastardly hoax, it will cause doubt to be cast on future real claims of assault based on race and sexual orientation. It also will have a negative impact on race relations. This is not something to be taken lightly. If Smollett is found guilty of a felony as he is charged, he should suffer heavy penalties, including jail time. There's a lesson to be learned from one of Aesop's fables, ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf."""

When did he begin to feel that he was not famous enough? Why did he believe that he needed to do such an insane act to gain the attention he deemed was not being given to him or his career?

I will tell you why. Because Smollett seems to be as obsessed with being famous as we are at watching famous people…in any form or fashion. He’s afraid to walk down the street and not be recognized. He’s afraid to lose the “we saved a seat for you” access. He’s afraid to lose the “I have a table waiting for you sir” reservation. He’s afraid to lose the money, lifestyle, privileges and attention that becoming a hyped-up, self-worth American celebrity affords you. It’s an addiction to importance, validity and worth that celebrity have come to mean in America. It’s sick and has become a sickness. It can and will destroy you if you can’t recognize it and classify it properly.

Smollett’s first album didn’t do as well as he would have liked. “Empire” is no longer a number one show and there were rumors he might be cut from the show. It doesn’t matter if that’s true or false. To the contrary, some say he was revered on and off set. However, Smollett wasn’t a topic of everyday conversation before January 29, 2019. He wasn’t trending on social media and memes weren’t taking over his identity, but they are now.

Is that famous enough for you, Jussie? Is this enough attention?

You know what they say; any publicity is good publicity. Yeah well, that works sometimes, and particularly really well, for one white man who lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue who can now use this event to further divide our country by saying that he is a target of a witch hunt and deny his racist ways.

What does it do for Jussie? Ensures long-term unemployment for yet another Black man. Further, it disgraces us all because we claimed him and defended him and then we felt the disappointment in the revelation of the truth, a feeling we all know too well.

So, what now? Is the Black community expected to do the same thing we always do…we pray for him. We talk about it over most of our meals over the next few weeks. We ask questions that we have no answers to on social media. We speculate on what will happen to him in the future and we figure out how not to make this an indictment on us collectively.

We’ve been receiving regular updates from the Chicago Police Department as the investigation has progressed, but as Ed Morrissey pointed out on Thursday, the “update” from the city’s Superintendent of Police, Eddie Johnson, was of a far more personal nature and breaks with traditional law enforcement communications. Rather than simply laying out the latest facts and findings, Johnson issued a very personal announcement that seemed to show that he’s wrapped the case up and been personally affected by it. As an African-American and lifelong resident of the Windy City, he described himself at various points as “offended” and “angry” over Smollett’s actions. He also wasn’t messing around with using terms like “alleged” in an ongoing investigation. He was flatly stating that this was a hoax. (NBC News)

This announcement today recognizes that “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career. I’m left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? How can an individual who’s been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims? Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim who is in need of support by police and investigators, as well as the citizens of this city.

Since Jussie Smollett is still sticking to his story, he remains innocent until proven guilty. (In fact, he was back on the set last week, “swearing to God” to his castmates that he didn’t do it.) But that’s not how the cops are treating this one, even at the highest ranks. Rather than talking about a “suspect” in the alleged filing of a false police report, Eddie Johnson is speaking of the incident as something he’s satisfied is a settled matter.

That’s not how these things typically play out. From what we’ve been told thus far, there’s still a “he said/they said” aspect to the charges. The two Nigerian men who were originally arrested are saying it was orchestrated by Smollett while the actor maintains they actually attacked him. For the Superintendent to come out with such a definitive statement, he must have some seriously convincing evidence ready for the prosecutors to present.

Meanwhile, this case continues to dog both Hollywood and Washington. Kamala Harris still has no comment, but she’s willing to hang out with another famous hate crime hoaxer. This weekend she was dodging reporters’ questions about the Smollett case while huddling with Al Sharpton. (I previously wrote about the laughable nature of having Sharpton talking about Jussie Smollett.)

Does Senator Harris have anyone advising her these days? The timing of this particular meeting couldn’t be more awkward. Just as reporters were chasing her down for a comment on Jussie-Gate, she’s taking a meeting with the guy who helped perpetrate the Tawana Brawley hoax? It seems as if that particular item on her calendar could have been handled with a conference call, but I suppose Sharpton wants all of the candidates to come to bow and scrape to him in person if they want his support. How a hustler like Al Sharpton retains this amount of influence in the Democratic Party is every bit as much of a mystery as what Jessie Smollett was thinking when he allegedly cooked up this plan."

Smollett claimed he was attacked by two white men on Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago. The men yelled slurs and one told Smollett “This is MAGA country,” in reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

But police officials said on Feb. 21 that Smollett actually orchestrated the alleged attack because he was upset about his salary on “Empire.” Smollett, police said, hired two Nigerian-Americans to carry out the assault and pose as Trump supporters.

“Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.

Howard took to Instagram on Feb. 24 to defend Smollett, claiming that his friend and colleague could not have done what police said he did. Howard shared a video of Smollett playing with Howard’s son on a plane, saying, “All your lil homies got you. … We love the hell outta you.”

When an Instagram user criticized Howard for supporting Smollett, Howard fired back.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know. The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly,” he wrote.

“His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Taraji Henson, another “Empire” co-star, has also defended Smollett amid the investigation, even as it turned from a probe into the alleged attack to one of Smollett being an alleged criminal himself.

Henson took to Instagram a few days after the reported attack, saying, “I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now.”

She later added, “My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now.”

On Feb. 20, Henson on Twitter shared a post by 20th Century Fox that stated: “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

Henson neglected to share the studio’s follow-up posts over the next several days.

On Feb. 21, 20th Century stated, following Smollett’s arrest on the charge of filing a false police report: “We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.”

The next day, the studio released a joint statement from Lee Daniels and the other “Empire” executive producers.

“Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” it said in part.

The executive producers also said that Smollett’s character was being removed from the last two episodes of the current season of “Empire.”"

Howard had posted a video of the actor who was spotted rocking a giggling baby boy. He accompanied his video post with a caption in which he made it known that the actor’s friends were all strongly behind him despite what he was going through.

He said: ""All your lil homies got you … We love the hell outta you.”

His post, however, came a day after it was announced that the embattled actor who plays the role of Jamal Lyon would be removed from the final two episodes of the much loved drama series. The move according to them, was necessary to avoid further disruption on set.

The check’s memo line reads, “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go).”

The check was dated Jan. 23, six days before Smollett claims he was attacked in a hate crime. A copy of the check was first published online by TMZ.

Sources close to Smollett told ABC News the actor was starting to train for an upcoming music video titled “Don’t Go,” in which he had to appear shirtless. ABC News obtained a calendar entry of Smollett’s that indicates the video was scheduled to be filmed Feb. 23.

The $3,500 check was $600 per week for the workout plan, plus $100 per week for the nutrition plan, over five weeks, a source close to Smollett told ABC News.

ABC News has also obtained copies of text messages apparently between Smollett and one of the Osundairo brothers, whom he calls “Bon,” in which the two discuss exercise and meal plans in the days preceding the alleged attack.

In one of the texts, dated Jan. 25, Bon writes, “This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.”

The copies of the text messages also were first published online by TMZ.

A Chicago Police Department spokesperson referred ABC News to the Cook County State’s Attorney when asked for comment, but added, “In the interrogation they [the brothers] told police about the money. That interview is also electronically recorded.”

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men near his apartment in Chicago around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. The two men, Smollett initially said, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him as a rope was wrapped around his neck and an unknown chemical substance was poured on him. The alleged assailants yelled “MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan, police were told.

Police identified and questioned two “persons of interest” captured on surveillance video near the scene around the time of the alleged attack. The men, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were arrested on Feb. 13 but then released without charges, with police saying they were no longer considered suspects.

While being questioned by investigators, the brothers claimed that Smollett paid them to help orchestrate and stage the crime after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent Jan. 22 to the Fox studio where the television series Empire is filmed, did not get enough attention, law enforcement sources told ABC News.

Last Wednesday, Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false crime report. By that evening, police officially had classified the actor as a suspect in the ongoing investigation. Detectives subsequently presented evidence to a Cook County grand jury.

Smollett, who has consistently denied any role in staging the supposed crime, turned himself in to police Thursday morning. He pleaded not guilty.

Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson accused Smollett of first sending himself the letter filled with “racial, homophobic and political language,” then orchestrating the alleged attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.”

“When that didn’t work, Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago’s reputation through the mud,” Johnson, visibly angry, told reporters.

“Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” the police chief added. “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? How can an individual who’s been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?”

Ask your HR director. There must be easier ways to get a salary bump.

In a dizzying turn of events, the star went from alleged victim to criminal defendant. The actor has now been arrested in Chicago and charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

If convicted, the actor could get one to three years in prison and face a $25,000 fine. And a story that could have helped shine a light on a rash of anti-LGBTQ violence in America will instead give those who are uncomfortable with the topic an excuse to stay in the dark.

I don’t see how we avoid it. There are too many stories. For instance, in a case that didn’t get a fraction of the attention given to the Smollett story, a gay couple was attacked and seriously injured by four men in Austin, Texas, on Jan. 19 in an apparent hate crime. According to the police report, Spencer Deehring and Tristan Perry were beaten and kicked until unconscious.

If Smollett did indeed stage this attack on himself, then the actor did incalculable harm to victims of genuine hate crimes, and shame on him. But if anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable discussing LGBTQ issues is using this case as an easy out, then shame on them.

Let’s catch up. Smollett, a gay African-American actor who stars in the Fox drama “Empire,” claimed that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago on Jan 29. He said that two men who recognized him from the show cornered him in the middle of the night. He said they yelled slurs, hit him, doused him with bleach, and put a noose around his neck — all while shouting, “This is MAGA country!”

A couple weeks later, police questioned two brothers from Nigeria, who told them that Smollett had hired them — at the bargain price of $3,500 — to stage the attack.

The stunt might have been phony, but the hatred it unleashed was real. A lot of it came from anti-Trump’ers — some of whom are running for president. In fact, @CoryBooker and @KamalaHarris both tweeted that this was an “attempted modern-day lynching.”

Meanwhile, as this drama was unfolding, the audience got into the act — and tripped over its own feet. Many of those who tried to follow each bounce of this story immediately jumped to conclusions based on nothing more than their biases.

It happened on both the oversensitive left, and the desensitized right. Liberals went off half-cocked and suggested the alleged incident was fueled by the same mood that helped elect Donald Trump. Conservatives cynically used the alleged hoax as an excuse to bash “identity politics.”

If we wanted something to be true, it was true. If we wanted it to be false, it must be false. Why? Because this story wasn’t about Smollett. It was about us — about how we feel about anti-LGBTQ violence.

C’mon people, how broken are we? We’ve gone from not listening to not thinking. We see a tweet or hear a rumor, and we decide — on the spot — whether or not it’s true based on our politics and our prejudices. Case closed.

Last month, when my brother — who happens to be gay, so his antennae are up for stories like this — texted me to share news of the alleged hate crime, I didn’t buy it. The journalist in me was skeptical that white racist homophobes who voted for Trump but also watched “Empire” were roaming the streets of a Democratic haven like Chicago.

But people kept talking about the story. So eventually, I mentioned the alleged attack in a column about how it is that so many LGBTQ stories are in the news these days. And I was careful to use the word “alleged.”

No matter. I still heard from readers who were eager to discount the whole column. Days before police arrested Smollett, they had already made up their minds that the alleged attack was a hoax. Like I said, we feel. We don’t think.

Never mind Jussie Smollett. The justice system will take care of him.

Who’s going to take care of fixing the rest of us?

ABC News(CHICAGO) — ABC News has obtained a copy of a $3,500 check apparently written by Empire actor Jussie Smollett to Abimbola Osundairo, one of the two brothers who police say helped stage an attack on Smollett in Chicago last month.

The check’s memo line reads, “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go).”

The check was dated Jan. 23, six days before Smollett claims he was attacked in a hate crime. A copy of the check was first published online by TMZ.

Sources close to Smollett told ABC News the actor was starting to train for an upcoming music video titled “Don’t Go,” in which he had to appear shirtless. ABC News obtained a calendar entry of Smollett’s that indicates the video was scheduled to be filmed Feb. 23.

The $3,500 check was $600 per week for the workout plan, plus $100 per week for the nutrition plan, over five weeks, a source close to Smollett told ABC News.

ABC News has also obtained copies of text messages apparently between Smollett and one of the Osundairo brothers, whom he calls “Bon,” in which the two discuss exercise and meal plans in the days preceding the alleged attack.

In one of the texts, dated Jan. 25, Bon writes, “This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.”

The copies of the text messages also were first published online by TMZ.

A Chicago Police Department spokesperson referred ABC News to the Cook County State’s Attorney when asked for comment, but added, “In the interrogation they [the brothers] told police about the money. That interview is also electronically recorded.”

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men near his apartment in Chicago around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. The two men, Smollett initially said, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him as a rope was wrapped around his neck and an unknown chemical substance was poured on him. The alleged assailants yelled “MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan, police were told.

Police identified and questioned two “persons of interest” captured on surveillance video near the scene around the time of the alleged attack. The men, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were arrested on Feb. 13 but then released without charges, with police saying they were no longer considered suspects.

While being questioned by investigators, the brothers claimed that Smollett paid them to help orchestrate and stage the crime after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent Jan. 22 to the Fox studio where the television series Empire is filmed, did not get enough attention, law enforcement sources told ABC News.

Last Wednesday, Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false crime report. By that evening, police officially had classified the actor as a suspect in the ongoing investigation. Detectives subsequently presented evidence to a Cook County grand jury.

Smollett, who has consistently denied any role in staging the supposed crime, turned himself in to police Thursday morning. He pleaded not guilty.

Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson accused Smollett of first sending himself the letter filled with “racial, homophobic and political language,” then orchestrating the alleged attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.”

“When that didn’t work, Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago’s reputation through the mud,” Johnson, visibly angry, told reporters.

“Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” the police chief added. “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? How can an individual who’s been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?”

The Oscars ceremony was notably diverse, and will be remembered for some historic wins – and the absence of a host – but Academy voters were accused of grossly overrating Green Book, which was named best picture in a surprise victory over Roma, and Bohemian Rhapsody, whose lead, Rami Malek, was named best actor.

A highlight of the night was Olivia Colman’s memorably hilarious acceptance speech after picking up the best actress award for The Favourite.

Democrats launch major push to counter wave of voter suppression

Terri Sewell, an Alabama congresswoman from the civil rights crucible of Selma, will introduce a bill to the House of Representatives tomorrow that could help repair American’s electoral system after it emerged that hundreds of thousands of people have been disenfranchised. She told the Guardian it was time to restore and advance American democracy, adding: “We don’t want just to shatter the glass ceiling, we want to break down the door.”

Disenfranchised. Last year’s midterm election cycle effectively disqualified voters from exercising their democratic right at rates “more widespread and brazen than in any other since the modern-day assault on voting began”.

Guaidó to meet Pence after day of violence at Venezuelan border with Brazil

The Venezuelan opposition leader is set to meet the US vice-president, Mike Pence, today after he called on the international community to consider “all options” to remove Nicolás Maduro from power. The meeting comes after at least four people were killed and around 300 injured in clashes when Venezuelan troops on the country’s borders prevented the delivery of aid over the weekend.

Sanctions or intervention. US hawks including Marco Rubio, who on Sunday posted a chilling tweet with a photo of a bloodied Muammar Gaddafi, appear open to military action, but the Trump administration has remained cautious. Spain, the former colonial power, has warned that it will not back any sort of military intervention.

May insists she will remain PM after Brexit as she delays vote on deal

The British prime minister Theresa May has said her job is not just to take the UK out of the European Union but to pursue her domestic agenda beyond Brexit, although she refused to reply when asked whether she would resign by Christmas. May struck a note of defiance and dismissed pressure to step down after sparking a fierce backlash by delaying a “meaningful vote” on the Brexit deal.

May day. Businesses have lost faith in the political process, the Institute of Directors has warned, with confidence in the service sector plunging amid uncertainty and fears that the UK could leave the EU without a deal.

Three years ago, academics analysed almost 2,000 stories, concluding that there were six “core trajectories” for all stories. But what constitutes plagiarism?

Say what you will about Trump, his tactics on North Korea are working

The US president has been mocked for his cringeworthy photo opportunities with Kim Jong-un, but if he achieves denuclearisation then he will silence the jeers, William M Arkin writes.

Say what you will about Trump, but after some very bad years of active nuclear testing and missile shooting, disarmament on the Korean peninsula has already occurred. Things are quieter and two leaders who previously weren’t talking – ever – now are.

Ratings Tanked Amid Constant Trump-Bashing

Interestingly, this year’s Academy Awards kept the Trump-bashing to a minimum — a stark contrast to 2017 and 2018.

This was probably because ratings for the 3-hour leftist political lecture masquerading as an awards show cratered in recent years amid backlash that it has become too politicized and too negative.

In 2018, #Oscars TV rating hit an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers. This is because people finally realized that Oscars is not credible.

Where Is Jussie Smollett’s Oscar?

Noticeably absent from the award for “Best Actor for Faking a Hoax Hate Crime” was “Empire” star Jussie Smollett. Smollett has been charged with filing a fake police report after claiming he was the victim of a racist hate crime by white Trump supporters.

Chicago police say that Smollett paid $3,500 to two Nigerian brothers to stage the hoax attack, presumably in a bid to smear all Trump supporters.

Why Didn’t Hollywood Invite Illegals to the Oscars?

We noticed that Hollywood did not take actor Robert Davi up on his offer to allow illegal immigrants and unvetted refugees into their lavish awards ceremony or swanky after-parties.

In a 2017 open letter to Hollywood, Davi challenged Hollywood liberals to invite illegal aliens and refugees to the Academy Awards without their armed security details.

Davi said if they refused to invite these needy folks to their shindigs, then they’re racist. As usual, Hollyweird talks the talk, but doesn’t walk the walk.

While rational Americans have long since tuned out the liberal Hollywood self-love fest known as the Academy Awards, President Donald Trump’s eldest son turned to Twitter on Sunday night to ridicule the occasion.

Capitalizing on three recent events, Trump Jr. brilliantly offered up nominations for “best performance in a politically motivated hate hoax.”

And the three nominees tagged made tough work out of selecting a “winner.”

First up was Nathan Phillips, the Native American activist involved in a confrontation (that wasn’t) with a group of Catholic high school students. Turns out, events did not transpire as the media reported, with Phillips proving to be less than honest about it.

The next choice was Christine Blasey Ford, the psychology professor at Palo Alto University who leveled uncorroborated accusations of sexual assault against now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Ford reached way back to her high school days in accusing Kavanaugh, even though everybody she named as being present failed to recall the incident she described.

The final choice was none other than actor Jussie Smollett, who was just charged with staging his own hate crime attack by so-called Trump supporters, after the two men he allegedly hired to assault him and leave a noose around his neck gave up the goods to Chicago police.

“Cast your vote now. The nominees for best performance in a politically motivated hate hoax are…,” Trump Jr. tweeted.

Cast your vote now. The nominees for best performance in a politically motivated hate hoax are… #oscars #Oscars19 #AcademyAward pic.twitter.com/MadiUVw9Oq — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 25, 2019

In the end, these three incidents prove what those who have been paying attention already know, that for the left the end really does justify the means.

Regardless of who must be thrown under a bus to advance their political agenda.

With the weaponizing of the #MeToo Movement, the inclusion of Ford, given her status as an alleged victim in post-Obama America, where victimization is power, resulted in plenty of manufactured outrage from the left.

Exhibit A:

I cant belive @Twitter allows this kind of harrasment, Christine Ford suffered enough and this guy has to call her a lier! Tweet Storm is coming https://t.co/G4n0QSSzmN — James Forbes (@JamesJForbes) February 25, 2019

As for Trump Jr., not only did he provide entertainment at the Oscars’ expense, he also did the country a solid in offering a summary of the award show, allowing folks to utilize their time in a more productive manner.

…like slamming their hand in a car door.

The aforementioned summary:

“I’ll save you guys the trouble & summarize the #Oscars so you don’t have to watch.

Trump: bad, despite booming economy & lowest black/Hispanic unemployment ever.

Walls: Immoral, except outside our houses.

Socialism: Pay no attention to mayhem in Venezuela, let’s give it a try.”

Given the toxic wasteland that his Twitter feed has become, the country owes him a debt of gratitude for absorbing such negative energy likely to surface in much more harmful ways otherwise."

While he might not have been at last night’s ceremony, Macaulay Culkin sure made the Oscars memorable for a lot of us.

The Home Alone star put his social media to good use when he decided to live-tweet all the madness from the 91st Academy Awards on Sunday night.

And he took no prisoners in the process.

The 38-year-old started the hashtag #MackTweetsTheOscars and we have to tell you, much like the shiny Oscars statuette, it was pure, golden goodness.

He also bathed (Picture: Twitter/IncredibleCulk)

From his moving black and white images to questioning why he was not (yet again) in the in-memorium section, ‘despite trying to hard’, Macaulay won the best Twitter award hands down for the hours he spent giving us gold.

Advertisement

It all started when he lamented the fact he wasn’t replacing Kevin Hart as Oscars host.

No room for a host, sorry Mack (Picture: Twitter/IncredibleCulk)

‘Awwww. Just found out they’re not having anyone host this year. Heading home,’ he wrote alongside a photo of himself dressed smartly in a suit, looking despondent.

He added: ‘Apparently, there is a “list” you have to “be on” to be host. @BillyCrystal @jimmykimmel can you get me on that list?’

Seems it didn’t work and calling upon his fellow 90s child actor comrade Devon Sawa, he asked if he ‘got the call’ to host. The dejected star then took his bottle of champagne and decided to just live-tweet what he was doing while not sitting in the glistening walls of the Dolby Theatre. Sharing his thoughts on the wins and losses and everything in between it was a rollercoaster ride.

Shall we?

After bagging out the (correct) spelling of The Favourite – it is a movie based in England, after all – he then wondered why Avengers star Chris Evans wasn’t taking his premier seating seriously.

‘Chris Evans has really good seats,’ Macaulay wrote. ‘I would have just tripped everyone all night.’

Okay, now we know why the kid wasn’t invited…

He wasn’t impressed with Vice’s win for best makeup, either. Seems he felt it was so easy to transform Christian Bale into Dick Cheney…

Still, he had an interesting idea about the real workings behind the scenes, as he quipped: ‘I presume the team nominated for Makeup and Hair on Vice were also responsible for force-feeding Christian Bale pie while he slept.’

Staying on the Vice train through the evening, seemingly fixated on the idea of Christian and pies, he later wrote: ‘When Christian Bale eats 100 pies it’s for a role, but when I do i’m just “depressed”.’

And then: ‘If Christian Bale had just ONE more pie… he would have won.’

Macaulay was also a little peeved Mary Poppins lost out on best costume design because ‘Lin Manuel [Miranda] looked great in that movie!’

We taste a hint of sarcasm at his turn as a lightfitter, buddy?

Then he started to tell us all about the things he was doing instead of hosting the Oscars.

From ‘popping this pimple’ to ‘holding my cat’, ‘playing Lego’ and ‘bathing’ – he really made full use of his all-of-a-sudden free night.

The world was left gasping following Trevor Noah’s takedown of Mel Gibson while presenting at the awards and Macaulay, surprise, surprise, had his own things on the matter, too.

‘Trevor Noah is a presenter?’ he quizzed. ‘Trevor Noah didn’t even make movies. I was America’s sweetheart.’

That was nothing compared to his savage take of the whole Jussie Smollett drama, with the Empire star arrested over a ‘false’ police report after claiming two men attacked him.

Macaulay’s thoughts? ‘Best Supporting Actors should be those two Empire extras who bought the rope.’

Woah.

And he really wanted Glenn Close to win best actress, as he began a running tally of her Oscar triumphs compared to comic movies and Marvel wins on the night.

When she was eventually pipped at the post by Olivia Colman, he wrote: ‘Glenn Close yet Glenn-so-far-away…’

Nothing was more in your face that his thoughts on this year’s in-memorium section, which paid tribute to those in the industry that died over the past year. Macaulay wasn’t happy he was yet to be mentioned, you see.

Even though he’d worried punters years ago when he emerged in public looking pretty…un-Macaulay Culkin, he continues to thrive. Which is good.

But still, he wanted answers, as he wrote: ‘I can’t believe this is the 5th Year in a row I’m not in the in-memoriam… and I’ve been trying so hard.’

When it came to the #MeToo movement, he was there to throw some perhaps uncomfortable zingers on the barbie.

‘Just statistically speaking, there are at like at least 14 secret rapists in that room right now. And 6 secret DJs,’ he wrote, before referencing controversial Bohemian Rhapsody director Bryan Singer, who was accused of sexual misconduct: ‘If Bohemian Rhapsody wins Best Picture it won’t be the first time an alleged sex offender directed a Best Picture.’

Mate, savage.

Still, we’d be behind this guy to take to the stage and host next year. Anyone disagree?

Presented by the New Jersey Education Association

Good Monday morning!

Before I get to the real news, I want to engage in some fun presidential speculation. Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan may be considering primarying Trump in 2020, according to recent reports .

I’m skeptical anyone could put up much of a challenge to Trump in a primary. But I wonder if New Jersey Republicans quietly hope so.

Our state had been trending more and more Democratic for a couple decades before Trump took office. But there’s no question he accelerated that trend. Face it, no matter what the pro-Trump Republicans say, Democrats wouldn’t have an 11-1 House majority in New Jersey without the president fueling their base and alienating more moderate, traditionally Republican voters.

So imagine our congressional races in 2020 if the moderate and popular-in-his-similarly-blue-home-state Hogan were the GOP’s nominee. Would he play better in those once reliably Republican suburbs that Trump all but handed to Democrats?

I would normally expect some elasticity in those flipped House seats, with one or two bouncing back in the next election. But with Trump on the ballot in 2020, there’s a good chance the same dynamic in 2018 is at play.

But I also wouldn’t expect a lot of New Jersey Republicans, notwithstanding Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick, to publicly get behind a Hogan bid knowing they’d likely face a primary challenge soon after. Especially when one of the county Republican parties that is losing the most in the Trump era is doubling down on its association with the president by spending their increasingly-limited resources bringing in pro-Trump personalities .

The state Senate was prepared to vote in favor of overriding Murphy’s veto on Thursday, but Senate President Steve Sweeney, the primary sponsor, agreed to try to negotiate new legislation in coming weeks. “We urge you to consider other solutions, like a new bill that limits the cost of the program to $20 million that would protect … residents while limiting the impact on the budget,” the letter states.

PORTAL II — As feds stall on Gateway funding, key bridge project is ready to go, by POLITICO’s Ryan Hutchins: As President Donald Trump’s administration continues to stymie funding for the Gateway rail tunnel and other related work along the Northeast Corridor, New Jersey officials say a key bridge project is now ready to go as soon the feds pony up. NJ Transit, the project sponsor, said Friday it had completed all five major elements of an early-construction contact for the Portal North Bridge, the replacement for an aging, swing-style rail span that has become one of the worst bottlenecks on the busiest stretch of railroad in America. While the initial work was done with the help of a $16 million federal TIGER grant awarded last September, the rest of the $1.6 billion for the project will have to wait until the Department of Transportation signs off on federal matching funds through the Capital Investment Grants Program — if it ever does.

The 50-year-old Saddle River businessman would have the ability to self-finance a campaign against Gottheimer, a two-term Democrat known as the `human fundraising machine.‘ Right now, the idea of a Luing campaign is only speculative, according to three sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.

BURLCO GOP IS DYING. QUICK, SOMEONE CALL JEANINE PIRRO AND DIAMOND & SILK TO REVIVE IT — “Murphy key to Dems taking Burlco sheriff post early,” by New Jersey Globes David Wildstein: “The announcement that Burlington County Sheriff Jean Stanfield will retire on May 1, seven months early and six months before the November general election, creates an opportunity for Democrats — now the majority party in Burlington — to take control of the Sheriff’s Department this spring. Republicans have lost one of their top vote-getters heading into the November 2019 general elections. There had been speculation that Stanfield was preparing to retire after six terms as sheriff. Both parties are expected to re-open their candidate search now that Stanfield will not be a candidate. Even with Burlington becoming more Democratic in recent years, Stanfield still would have been favored to hold the seat. Upon Stanfield’s departure, Undersheriff Diane Jasmine will become acting sheriff. Jasmine would remain in that post until January, when the winner of the general election is sworn in — unless Gov. Phil Murphy decides to name a replacement.” Read more here

BEZOSMINSTER — “Amazon to Somerset County? Freeholder wants to make bid for HQ2,” by The Courier-Post’s Mike Deak: “Somerset County Freeholder Director Brian Levine is not afraid of quixotic quests. Ten years ago, as the Republican mayor of Franklin Township, he mounted a campaign against tremendous odds for the GOP nomination for governor. Chris Christie won that contest. Now he is mounting another possibly long-shot campaign to lure Amazon to locate its new headquarters in Somerset County. ‘Somerset County is on the map,’ Levine told the Somerset County Employers Legislative Committee at a Friday luncheon at Verve Bistro. ‘I want to make it bigger on the map.’ Levine said he wants to make the bid for the second Amazon headquarters in partnership with Newark, which was a top 20 finalist for the headquarters after the corporation reviewed more than 100 applications from cities nationwide.” Read more here

BLENDER FOUND IN KITCHEN IS A MAGIC BULLET, HOWEVER — “Stockton's Atlantic City campus not economic 'magic bullet,' report finds,” by The Press of Atlantic City’s David Danzis: “Stockton University’s arrival — or rather its return — will have a long-term positive impact on the local economy, but officials caution against overly optimistic ideas that it will radically reshape the city’s fortunes. A new report from the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton included a study on the institution’s long-range impact on its host city and determined the university will ultimately serve as a catalyst for economic growth. But, despite the rosy outlook, the study’s author cautions against putting too much stock in the university’s ability to alter Atlantic City’s growth.” Read more here

ROCK-ROCK ROCKAWAY BREACH OF CONTRACT — “Rockaway Twp.'s new mayor sues council, similar to previous mayor,” by The Daily Record’s Gene Myers: “Before his unexpected death in August, the late Rockaway Township Mayor Michael Dachisen was embroiled in a lawsuit with the Township Council he claimed was usurping his authority. The new mayor has filed a similar suit against the same council. Mayor Michael Puzio, less than six months on the job, announced on Tuesday that he filed a lawsuit against Council President Tucker Kelley and the council. A disagreement about the township attorney contract is at the heart of the conflict, according to the suit. ‘When I became mayor, I promised the citizens of Rockaway Township that I would make every effort to work with the council to end the toxic atmosphere that existed for almost a year, and which frustrated responsible and productive government,’ reads Puzio's Facebook post where he announced the suit. The mayor said he was at his wits' end after trying ‘everything possible to bring about needed change’ in a town that fell prey to one controversy after another in 2018 due to harshly divided political lines that led to multiple lawsuits.” Read more here

Vaughn was served with a cease-and-desist letter Friday, sent to her Stuyvesant Avenue home. The letter came in response to comments Vaughn made on social media months back alleging North Ward councilwoman Marge Caldwell-Wilson was being investigated by the authorities after one of her campaign workers was criminally charged. The letter, a copy of which was provided to The Trentonian, warned the free-wheeling Vaughn about making any further `defamatory‘ statements.” Read more here

HANGIN' WITH MS. COOPER — “John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s Amsterdam honeymoon 'bed-in’ was crashed by a N.J. teenager,” by The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Kevin Riordan: “Purposeful, businesslike, and starstruck, Alisa Cooper picked up a house phone in the lobby of the Amsterdam Hilton and asked to be connected with John Lennon. She offered her name but didn’t mention that she was only 16 and on spring vacation with her mother. I have a talk show in the United States, she remembers saying, which was true, more or less. And I would like to arrange an interview. It was March 26, 1969. Lennon and his bride, the artist Yoko Ono, were on the hotel’s top floor, commanding global attention with a publicity-minded, but evidently heartfelt, honeymoon ‘bed-in’ for peace … Now 66, Cooper tells me the story (‘I never get tired of it’) from behind her desk at the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, a view of the Atlantic Ocean before her and a photo of her teen-aged self with John and Yoko on the wall behind her.” Read more here

A message from the New Jersey Education Association: With a pandemic devastating our economy, schools across New Jersey are losing $335 million in promised funding.

But help is on the horizon. The New Jersey Senate already unanimously passed a healthcare reform bill that will pump hundreds of millions back into schools while saving educators money. Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin has called it an important step to save money. And Governor Murphy has promised his support.

It’s time for the Assembly to vote and save our schools.

IT ONLY TOOK 70 YEARS FOR THE BEGINNING TO START — “Archdiocese of Newark: Release of names of priests accused of sex abuse was only the beginning,” by Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin for The Star-Ledger: “Our Church cannot move forward until we have fully addressed the past. Hence, it is crucial to emphasize to the victims, their families, the faithful, and the public at large that the publication last week does not represent an endpoint in our efforts. Rather, it is a beginning. The release of this information represents our commitment to a new level of transparency in the reporting and response to allegations of abuse.” Read more here

“Rutgers basketball: The piece of Paul Robeson's legacy you probably don't know,” by The Asbury Park Press’ Jerry Carino: “In December of 1918, when the Rutgers basketball team played its home opener against Colgate, the strategy was simple: Get the ball inside to one of the best athletes in the east, Paul Robeson. It was not easy. As reported by the Daily Home News of New Brunswick, Colgate’s players ‘started by roughing Robey.’ The newspaper’s account, as detailed in the 1998 book ‘The Young Paul Robeson’ by Lloyd Brown, continued, ‘frequently at the opening of the game he was knocked down. … Apparently the roughing was to no avail, for each time Robey came up with a smile, only to enter the fray with renewed pep.’ It should be noted that basketball was a more spartan game in that era. But the whistle-free hammerings of Robeson — and his bring-it-on response — were part of the deal for the pioneers who integrated college sports. The spring marks the 100th anniversary of Robeson’s graduation from Rutgers, and most of his story is widely known: He was a two-time All-America in football and one of the greatest ends of his time, enduring dirty play and racist taunts from opposing teams and fans; he attained worldwide fame as a singer and actor; he was a staunch human-rights advocate who became blacklisted during McCarthyism.” Read more here

“We have a problem in America called spatial geographic inequality, which means that the most affluent and educated people are clustered in just a few cities,” he explained.

“Maybe that has something to do with why Trump voters are obsessed with ‘owning the libs,’ because the libs own everything else,” Maher joked.

“The blue parts of America are having a big prosperity party, while that big sea of red feels like their invitation got lost in the mail — and they still use the mail,” he continued.

Maher also weighed in on the Jussie Smollett scandal rocking the United States. Smollett was arrested and charged after he was accused of staging a hate crime last month in Chicago. Maher tried to explain Smollett's actions by saying that in America, “there’s nothing more powerful than being a victim.”

“I feel like we’ve gone from this place where I hear people say, ‘Victims should be believed.’ Victims should be taken seriously. Victims should not always be believed,” Maher said. “Take you seriously – that’s a big difference, but we seem to have skipped that step because we always do.”"

Rather than seek another interview with the actor, Chicago PD will now seek, as CPD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi put it, to “negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.” Should he be found guilty, Smollett could spend up to three years behind bars. Smollett’s lawyers have promised “aggressive defense” in light of the charges.

Original post: The twisty-turny and deeply-upsetting-either-way-it-turns-out case of Jussie Smollett has yet to be formally resolved, with key questions still up in the air. But Chicago PD aren’t taking chances. As per Variety, they’ve named the Empire actor and singer — whose claims that he was the victim of a hate crime have in the last week been called into question — as a suspect in another potential crime: filing a false police report.

The alleged incident happened over three weeks ago, and all the while Smollett has stuck by his word, alleging that he was assaulted by two men who shouted homophobic and racist epithets, doused him in bleach, and put a noose around his neck. Last week Chicago PD rounded up and interrogated two suspects. The men, Nigerian brothers, were then released, with police saying they came to believe Smollett had paid them to stage the attack.

If that turns out to be true — and, remember, nothing has been proven so far — then this could carry far-reaching implications about how police and especially society (read: social media) respond to future allegations of assault, particularly if they involve claims of bigotry.

It also means Smollett would have committed a Class 4 felony, as per Chicago PD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi, who tweeted the news that the performer is “now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report,” and that “Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

In the meantime, Fox has said they’re sticking by Smollett, despite earlier claims that his Empire scenes were being cut. Others, like The Daily Show host Trevor Noah, are understandably confused.

Over the past 25 years, I’ve analyzed more than 100 racial-hoax cases, beginning with the 1987 case of Tawana Brawley, an African American teen who falsely said that several white men had raped her. My book The Color of Crime covers 92 such cases.

Approximately two-thirds of hoax perpetrators are white. White accusers are more likely to say they were victims of a random act of violence by a make-believe black offender. Black people who create hoaxes are more likely to say they were victims of a hate crime by an imaginary white perpetrator.

These hoaxes have one thing in common: They tap into our conscious and unconscious beliefs about the nexus between race and crime. The accusers are counting on stereotypes to distract the police and the public from what actually took place.

People carry out racial hoaxes for all sorts of reasons—serious, mundane, or even silly. Here’s a short list of past accusers’ motives: to draw attention to a social issue, to get attention from a spouse, to stop making car payments, to get time off from work, to cover up a gambling loss, to cash in on an insurance policy, and to avoid punishment for violating curfew. In 2005, the “runaway bride” Jennifer Wilbanks made up a sexual assault by a Hispanic kidnapper to explain her absence from her own wedding. Or accusers fabricate crimes by others to cover up their own. In the Charles Stuart case in 1989 and the Susan Smith case in 1994, white murderers blamed nonexistent black attackers.

In the universe of racial hoaxes, Smollett’s case is noteworthy in a few important ways. It involves a celebrity hoax perpetrator, the only such case that I’m aware of. With his high public profile, Smollett could bring an authority and a personal appeal to the narrative that other accusers could not. His allegations of anti-gay as well as antiblack slurs raised fears across more than one marginalized community.

Adam Serwer: The lesson of the Jussie Smollett case

Still, the twists and turns in the Smollett case follow a familiar pattern. Many hoaxes have a lurid specificity—dramatic criminal flourishes such as a carved letter on the victim’s cheek, gang rape, a peculiar body odor, or in Smollett’s case, a supposed attacker’s claim that “this is MAGA country.” Initially, supporters provide public solace to the purported victim. Sometimes members of the targeted community make calls for change and demand greater protection and stiffer laws to protect victims. But, inevitably, there are unanswered questions and facts that don’t quite add up, which ultimately lead to the unraveling of the tale.

Once the lie is exposed, everyone is angry—those who believed the hoax, those who never believed it, and the police officers who wasted taxpayer dollars investigating a crime that never happened. Any relief that the alleged crime did not take place is de minimis."

In a ruling issued late Friday in Houston, U.S. District Judge Gray Miller denied the government's motion to stay a lawsuit originally brought by the National Coalition for Men, a nonprofit ""men's rights"" advocacy group, which is seeking an injunction ordering the Selective Service System to require women to register for the draft.

The draft itself ended during the final stages of the Vietnam War in 1973, but all American men ages 18 to 26 are still required to register with the Selective Service System so the military could move quickly if it ever needed to reinstate conscription.

Miller, who was appointed to the court by President George W. Bush in 2006, noted that the Supreme Court upheld excluding women from the draft in 1981 because women were excluded from combat duty. Because that prohibition was lifted in 2015, he wrote, excluding them from registering for the draft made no constitutional sense.

Seven episodes were already completed before Smollett was charged last week with felony disorderly conduct, accused of filing a false police report. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men attacked him last month in downtown Chicago, hurling slurs and looping a rope around his neck. Investigators say he planned the hoax, soliciting the help of a friend and the friend’s brother, because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Smollett denies the allegations.

Are we proud citizens of a republic or are we “poor players” -- stinking bit players -- as William Shakespeare’s Macbeth claimed, in a “tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing?” Following more than two years of the most defamatory reporting ever seen in American political history about Pres. Donald Trump, the Senate Intelligence Committee, after reviewing more than 300,000 documents has, on a bipartisan basis, said there was no evidence of collusion. NBC, reporting on this, still chose to emphasize that members of the Trump campaign actually met with or talked to numerous Russians during the campaign as though meeting with foreign nationals were itself suspect or even borderline illegal. Nevertheless, NBC’s article is still looking forward to some accusations of wrongdoing, although not of illegality, coming out of the Senate Committee’s final report. The mass hysteria (Shakespeare’s “sound and fury”) about this matter has brought incessant, daily cries for impeachment of Trump since even before his inauguration. The outrage at Trump’s “impeachable conduct” for this length of time is parallel to the outrage at the alleged ""hate crime mistreatment"" of Jussie Smollett, two false narratives that were promoted by the media to get higher ratings and promote social and political disruption on an unparalleled scale. All attempts at impartial reporting and discriminating sorting through of the facts or having a wait-and-see attitude were thrown out the window by most of our Fourth Estate. Today’s newsrooms are filled with newscasters seeking and finding celebrity status by being glamorous, articulate troublemakers.

Truth be told, this manipulation of the public cannot be laid entirely at the feet of the egregiously partisan and unprofessional media moguls and their lackeys who appear so polished and beautified on air. And let me add that the term “fake news” is actually a somewhat lighthearted way of accusing a lot of major media outlets of doing something much more egregious than mere “fake news.” This term has a slightly comic or jocular dimension as if the President were saying the reporting cannot be trusted, but is, at the same time, in the category of mere self-serving mischief or sleight-of-hand. In truth, these incessant accusations are a betrayal of every standard of journalistic ethics. In the Preamble of the Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics, it is stated, “An ethical journalist acts with integrity.” Integrity involves a judicious attempt to assess the facts and not draw conclusions that are more hyperbole than they are circumspect. If one then goes on to read the listed planks of the Code of Ethics, one will see that coverage by major leftwing media print and TV outlets are failing to apply each and every item. When do you see or hear opinion pieces on major leftwing outlets that even begin to discuss or adjudicate between competing narratives? Nonstop accusations are also egregious violations of the 3500-year-old Ten Commandments which says “Thou shall not bear false witness.” Don Wilton, writing for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association says, “There are several ways in which false witness can be borne. A person can help spread a rumor and thus join hands with a perpetrator. One can indulge false witness by turning a blind eye when truth is known. Someone can determine to bear false witness and therefore be guilty of premeditation. A person can simply fail to come forward with the truth or insinuate falsehood without actually saying it is so. And, perhaps worst of all, a person can spread gossip about another, thus engaging in some of the worst forms of character assassination.” Every single one of these deviations can be found in the reportage about Trump collusion by the MSM for the past two plus years. But, despite their violations of the Journalist Code of Ethics and, even worse, their ignorant contempt for the Ten Commandments, our foul Fourth Estate is being encouraged by the sinister cabal that has led our Justice Department, and by the traitorous, hateful rhetoric of the Democratic Party which has, striven to undermine the unity of our country. It is incredible to this writer that Andrew McCabe can go on national TV and calmly claim -- seemingly without regret -- that he participated in discussions about leading an effort to remove from office a duly elected President of the United States, and not be arrested and/or immediately be interrogated at length by federal law enforcement. Those conversations are unlawful since the Justice Department has no legal authority to participate in, let alone initiate, a takeout of the President. YouTube screen grab Despite the fact that a real assassination with a real knife was not used, those conversations in the American Department of Injustice are a replay of the conspiracy against Julius Caesar depicted in Shakespeare’s play by that name. When Caesar at the moment when his close associate Brutus stabs and kills him cries out “Et tu Brute?!” he is uttering a cry of betrayal that has stood through the centuries. This phrase expresses the utter psychological torment of the victim of egregious betrayal. Our entire country, as if one person, should be crying out “Et tu Brute?!” But no. There are only polite discussions of the pros and cons of McCabe’s revelations, and the royalties for his book keeping pouring in. And we are the stinking bit players or props in this pathetic scenario. But we cannot leave this story of ignorance and betrayal without looking for a moment at the fetid collection of leaders amassed by the Democrats in their persistent intrigues against the President. Adam Schiff, Gerald Nadler, Maxine Walters, Nancy Pelosi, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Charles Schumer, Dick Durbin, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren are continuing the feeding frenzy about Trump, and hope to drive him out of office. If they cannot get him out with Russian collusion, they will try to get him for obstruction of justice. If they cannot get him for obstruction, they will try to get him for tax evasion. If they cannot get him for tax evasion they will try to get him for mental health issues. If they cannot get him for mental health issues, they will try to get him for violating the emoluments clause. Every single day for the remainder of his terms, they will blast, belittle, and besmirch President Trump. They will never once say they support this or that action undertaken by the President. They will never once express gratitude for even one executive decision or legislative initiative. They will never once compliment any members of the first family. They will never once deride opposition to the President or call for greater national unity. Thus, they become a coven of witches -- male witches as well as female -- who are stirring a cauldron. The cauldron is not the melting pot of unity, but a real witches’ brew of pig snouts and rats’ tails intended to cast a spell and a pall over this administration and the USA."

Who was Green Book for? As it turns out, Oscar voters. At the 91st Academy Awards, Peter Farrelly’s film pulled off a surprise Best Picture win, to go alongside trophies in Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay. In a wide-open Best Picture race, Green Book was one of the top contenders all season long: The film burst onto the awards scene after winning the People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival, and sustained its momentum by triumphing at the Producers Guild of America Awards in January. Still, the win is likely to become one of the most controversial picks in recent memory, as Green Book had become one of this year’s official Oscars villains thanks to its even-handed approach to racism and the liberties it took with its depiction of musician Don Shirley. On Twitter, the movie’s big night has been met with shock and disgust — What were they thinking? Here’s an attempt to get inside the minds of the voters who named Green Book, a film in which Viggo Mortensen teaches Mahershala Ali how to eat fried chicken, the best movie of the year.

1. It allowed voters to lean into a soothing vision of interracial harmony.

If you told Green Book fans the movie was an old-fashioned relic that presented a comforting gloss on thorny social issues, they’d almost certainly agree with you. To many voters, Hollywood films are supposed to address intractable problems in a way that makes you walk out feeling good. This isn’t a dialectic that started with La La Land and Moonlight — Louis B. Mayer and John Huston were having similar arguments about realism versus escapism as far back as 1951, with the always-tasteful Mayer comparing the incoming wave of kitchen-sink naturalism to a woman going to the bathroom without closing the door: It was realistic, sure, but who’d want to see it? The past three years in Hollywood have been extremely fraught, and with big wins for Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody, voters in these trying times seem to be gravitating toward films that keep the bathroom door resolutely closed.

2. It still felt progressive to older voters.

While the legions of new voters may have had their votes split between Black Panther, Roma, and The Favourite, the older voters I met were nearly unanimous in gushing over Green Book. Online, how progressive Green Book was has been up for debate (it certainly has a rosier view of white cops in the Jim Crow–era than Shape of Water did), but those debates didn’t seem to sway the Academy members I spoke to, who responded to the film’s straightforward message of tolerance. In the third Oscars season of the Trump era, Green Book voters felt like they were taking a stand against bigotry by supporting the film, and no amount of think pieces were able to convince them otherwise. (In that sense, of all the issues that arose during Green Book’s campaign, the Nick Vallelonga tweet was the most damaging, which could explain why Vallelonga was generally kept out of the public eye in the season’s final weeks.) The Producers Guild uses the same kind of preferential ballot as Best Picture, and Green Book’s win there was an omen that all the controversy did not make the movie too hot to touch.

2a. But maybe not too progressive.

This is speculation on my part, but I wonder if the film’s let’s-just-slow-down-and-listen-to-each-other message resonated with moderate-liberal voters in a season where the Covington Catholic drama and the Jussie Smollett scandal took up so much oxygen. Before either of those popped off, I did hear from an older voter who seemed to have taken the #OscarsSoWhite controversy and the ensuing membership expansion slightly personally — they wondered if the Academy had “made up” for it with Moonlight’s win, and would soon go back to voting for what they liked, no matter what anyone said. Judging from the reaction to Green Book’s win, that turned out to be quite prescient. At the very least, there were certainly plenty of voters who felt protective of the movie, and did not appreciate what they saw as efforts to take it down.

3. It ran a solid campaign.

Team Green Book didn’t spend the most money — everyone seems to agree that Roma and Star Is Born cost the most — but they were some of the most active and successful campaigners of the season. While Farrelly didn’t score a director nomination, voters I spoke to found him a warm and sincere pitchman for the film as a whole, which helped him skate past an indecent exposure scandal that might have sunk a pricklier filmmaker. Bradley Cooper could tell you that Oscar voters don’t always love a newcomer, but Farrelly’s humor and self-deprecation seemed to disarm any notion of him as an Oscars arriviste. And once the bad headlines started to pile up, Mahershala Ali turned in another perfectly modulated performance on the trail, never defending the indefensible, but also never abandoning the film either. He spoke of Green Book as the rare project that offered him the chance to play a lead, its own kind of victory in terms of representation.

And though the Green Book camp rarely managed to find time to thank Dr. Shirley and his family during their time at the podium, they were still savvy enough to get co-signs from black icons like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Quincy Jones, Harry Belafonte, and Representative John Lewis, who introduced the film’s clip package at the Oscars alongside Amandla Stenberg. I’ve seen a few tweets from white writers implying that people like Lewis were somehow “forced” to speak up for Green Book, but that feels like an easy way out of cognitive dissonance to me. It might be more accurate to say that, having lived through the time period the movie depicts, these men had their own perspective on the dangers of going backwards, and the value of a reassuring fairy tale."

The slap-in-the-face Robert Kraft solicitation story is three days old, and if police in south Florida prove their case against the Patriots owner, I believe he’ll be suspended by commissioner Roger Goodell. Without any new weekend news on the case, I’ll lead this week with the official start of draft season.

The first round of the 2019 NFL Draft kicks off in Nashville two months from tonight. The first day of the week-long NFL Scouting Combine is Tuesday in Indianapolis. So it’s a good time for college-football know-nothings like me to start the learning process on the new names that will be household names in the pro football world by late April.

This is not setting up to be a dramatic draft year, or in the run-up to the draft, except for one thing: where Kyler Murray goes. The undersized (5-9 7/8, Oklahoma says) quarterback set college football on fire last fall and could go anywhere from the first overall pick (Arizona) to fourth (Oakland) to seventh (Jacksonville) to 13th (Miami) to 15th (Washington), or to a slot somewhere else after a trade. I covered Murray in depth last week and will spend most of my time here on the other 330 or so players in Indianapolis this week.

One bit of Murray news before we move on. The new Mike Mayock at NFL Network, Daniel Jeremiah—talk about big shoes to fill—told me over the weekend that he heard Murray has bulked up to 203 pounds from his OU playing weight of 190. And calling around over the weekend, I heard it was 206. That is significant. Here’s why: Talking to NFL people about Murray, as I wrote last week, there was worry that Murray had more of a Mookie Betts build in college than a Russell Wilson physique. Meaning Murray was not only small, but also slight. If Murray has spent the past five or six weeks bulking up, that would play in his favor at the combine and in completing scouting reports on a complex prospect, because teams want to see a thicker player than Murray was at OU. Theoretically, it would mean he’d be more equipped to withstand the pounding he’ll obviously have to face in the NFL.

I spoke to two long-time NFL personnel men and three media folk—Jeremiah, Mel Kiper of ESPN and Matt Miller, a rising authority with Bleacher Report—for draft info in advance of combine week. For more, please listen to The Peter King Podcast, with Jeremiah and Miller, dropping Wednesday.

One note before we start: It was cool to hear Jeremiah pay homage to the new general manager of the Oakland Raiders, Mayock—something he wanted to do before we started discussing draft nuts and bolts. You’ll enjoy that on the podcast. “He was a good teammate,” said Jeremiah, “and as good of a dude as everyone at home thinks he is.”

The Lead: Combine

Now for a few takes on the 2019 crop of collegians:

The Best Player in the Draft

• Nick Bosa. Nick Bosa. Nick Bosa. “Injured his senior year in high school [torn ACL], injured this year [core muscle surgery], but he’s my highest-rated player,’’ Kiper said of the Ohio State defensive end. “Great bend, great motor.”

• Said Jeremiah: “When I watch Nick, I see the exact same moves as his brother [Chargers pass-rusher Joey Bosa].”

• Pluses: 17.5 sacks in 29 college games, great instinct. The minus: season-ending injuries in two of his past four football seasons.

The Quality

• “Really strong defensive draft,” Kiper said. “Deep at defensive line. Deep through three rounds. Good running back and receiver depth in rounds two through five.”

• Jeremiah: “If you’re in the hunt for difference-makers on the defensive line, and overall depth on the offensive line … you’re going to feel great about this draft. Offensive line-wise, there’s no Joe Thomas, no Jonathan Ogden, but there’s depth.”

• For Jeremiah, 10 of his top 19 prospects in this draft are front-seven defensive players, including his top four: Bosa, Alabama defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, Kentucky pass rusher Josh Allen and Clemson defensive tackle Christian Wilkins.

The Passers

Not the quality of 2018, when quarterbacks went 1-3-7-10-32 in round one. On his big board, Jeremiah has Kyler Murray 14th, Ohio State’s Dwayne Haskins 18th, Missouri’s Drew Lock 26th and Duke’s Daniel Jones 32nd. Those are ratings, not a projection of where Jeremiah thinks they’ll go.

• I’m hearing Haskins and Murray, in some order, are solid top 10 picks. “Haskins is a pure pocket passer,” Jeremiah said. “If he were to have come out 10 years ago, we’d be talking about him as a surefire top five pick … He just doesn’t move around very well. When he has to move off his spot he really struggles.”

• Jeremiah loves Lock’s arm but not his overall mechanics. “His feet are kind of all over the place,” he said.

• On Jones, Jeremiah thinks his grade will be mixed on different draft boards, with team that want a power arm downgrading him.

The Injury Mysteries

• Oklahoma receiver Marquise Brown (Lisfranc foot surgery) won’t run full-speed till August, but he might have been the fastest guy at the combine had he been fit enough to run. “I remember scouting DeSean Jackson at Cal, and this is a clone,” Jeremiah said. Brown will be a late-first-round gift to some team.

• Mississippi State defensive Jeffery Simmons likely would have been a top 10 pick before tearing his ACL recently; how far he slides will be a big pre-draft story.

• Kiper loves Bryce Love, the Stanford running back recovering from December ACL surgery; Love could be a fourth-round bargain in a draft full of middle-round backs.

The Meat of the Draft

Rounds two and three. It’s a good year to have six picks between 32 and 101, which is where the rich-get-richer Patriots find themselves. Said Jeremiah: “You look at the Baltimore Ravens picking at 22. They have no second-round pick. To me, if the Ravens pick at 22 I will buy you dinner the next time we’re together. I know the new GM, Eric DeCosta, taking over there from Ozzie Newsome, is a very bright guy. The value in this draft is in that second-round range. I would be surprised a team like Baltimore doesn’t take pick 22 and look to get out of there and see if they can flex some more picks there in that second-round range.”

The Skill Players

• General consensus: One back (Josh Jacobs of Alabama) in the top 20. There’s a feel that, in a league when 2016 Offensive Rookie of the Year Alvin Kamara was the 67th pick in a draft and 2016 NFL rushing champion Kareem Hunt was the 86th that you’re fine getting a good back—like Florida Atlantic’s Devin Singletary or Iowa State’s David Montgomery or Penn State’s Miles Sanders—somewhere between picks 40 and 100. “Running back value is in the second to the fifth round,” Kiper said.

• As for wideouts, it’s another deep year in the second and third rounds. Oklahoma’s Brown and Mississippi’s D.K. Metcalf lead the way on Jeremiah’s board.

• Interesting that Jeremiah has three tight ends among his top 25 players: Iowa’s T.J. Hockenson (5), Iowa’s Noah Fant (23) and Alabama Irv Smith Jr. (25). Yes, that’s two tight ends from Iowa in the first-round conversation. Fant will likely be the fastest tight end at the combine; he has run 4.64, And Hockenson is athletic with a Mark Bavaro-blocking streak. Add to that the fact that NFL teams love players from Iowa because they value coach Kirk Ferentz NFL-preparedness training. No school has ever produced two first-round tight ends in the same year.

Cautionary Tale

There won’t be many players who make or break anything in the next week, so throw anything you hear like that out of your mental window. I’ll tell you why. Last year, Oklahoma tackle Orlando Brown was Mayock’s number-two-rated tackle in the draft entering the combine, and he had a disastrous performance. He ran an Eisen-like 5.85 40-yard dash, and did a feeble 14 reps of the 225-pound bench press. Brown was ridiculed. The Ravens picked him in the third round. He played 15 games at tackle for Baltimore. Pro Football Focus had a higher 2018 grade for Brown than for the following zillionaire tackles: Trent Williams, Taylor Lewan, Jack Conklin, Nate Solder, Taylor Decker, Jason Peters and Cordy Glenn. So chill on conclusions drawn this week.

NFL Network’s complete coverage at the combine kicks off Monday, and position group coverage begins Friday. ESPN will have a live show from 1-3 p.m. featuring Kiper and other network analysts Saturday on ABC during the quarterback drills.

On Robert Kraft 10

Friday evening, an estimated 8.15 million American TV viewers heard anchor Lester Holt lead the NBC Nightly News this way: “Breaking news tonight … Shock waves as the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, is charged in a day-spa prostitution sting.”

On Saturday morning, the 4 million subscribers (newspaper and web) to the New York Times read this headline above the fold on the front page: “Patriots Owner Facing Charges After Sex Sting.” That’s commissioner Roger Goodell’s morning paper. Inside, in the lead story of the Times sports section, respected NFL correspondent Ken Belson wrote: “However the case is resolved, the episode is an embarrassment to a league that likes to portray itself as a pillar of moral rectitude but has struggled to shake an image that its players, employees and team owners treat women poorly.”

“KRAFT FACES CHARGES OF SOLICITATION,” blared the front page of Kraft’s hometown Boston Globe, which landed on newsstands all over his beloved six-state New England region.

The NFL’s Personal Conduct Policy mandates that owners and club officials “will be subject to more significant discipline” for violations of the policy and reads: “Everyone who is part of the league must refrain from conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the NFL.”

Prostitution. Sex trafficking. Video evidence of Kraft’s involvement, according to police. The most negative of headlines and news coverage, focused on one of the most important owners in recent league history, on the steward of the franchise that has won more Super Bowls in one era (six) than any franchise in league history … and leading the news on a day with Washington imploding. Add to that the specter of the NFL’s incessant recruitment of women as fans and consumers and fantasy football players, and add to that the feeling by many in the outer boroughs of the league that Kraft is especially close to the league office. It just ratchets up the pressure on Goodell’s prospective judgment in the case. In Goodell’s 12-and-a-half years as commissioner, he hasn’t faced a situation like this one. Which makes it difficult to forecast what Goodell will do to Kraft, if the charges are true.

But there are clues.

Everything about the charge of Kraft on two occasions soliciting a prostitute—one used against her will in a case of human trafficking—has to be prefaced with “if.” The cases arising from a strip-mall spa in Jupiter, Fla., against a cadre of accused men have not been publicly proven, and we’re reminded by the Jussie Smollett case to let the facts surface before passing judgment. Police in Jupiter, Fla., have alleged Kraft twice frequented a spa accused of prostitution, and the police say they have incriminating video of Kraft. A spokesman for Kraft “categorically” denied involvement “in any illegal activity.” The league said it was aware of the case and was monitoring developments, the NFL’s euphemism for, “We’re buying time.” So that’s where it stands this morning.

But if the charges against Kraft prove to be true, I believe the Ray Rice precedent will come into play. And that would not be good news for Kraft. I believe if Kraft is found guilty, commissioner Roger Goodell couldn’t give Kraft a hefty fine alone. The problem with a fine of Kraft? The last sitting owner to be seriously sanctioned by Goodell, Indianapolis’ Jim Irsay, was suspended for six games and fined $500,000 for driving while impaired. That sort of fine, on its own, would be the ultimate slap on the wrist to a man Forbes says is worth $6.8 billion. To be exact, $500,000 would be one-fourteenth of 1 percent of Kraft’s worth. Next to nothing, really. That’s part of the reason why I believe Kraft, if he is guilty, is more likely than not to be suspended.

Think back to the Rice case in 2014. Rice, a Ravens running back, had an altercation with his fiancé at an Atlantic City hotel, and Goodell suspended Rice for two games. The light punishment was derided by the public—particularly women’s groups—and Goodell looked feckless when video of the altercation surfaced and showed Rice decking his fiancé with a single punch. The league revised its punishment, suspending Rice indefinitely, but by then it was too late. Goodell was ripped nationally for running an initially shoddy investigation of the case and for being soft on domestic violence.

So now, if Kraft is found to have used prostitutes being employed against their will in a human-trafficking scheme, the commissioner will have two choices:

• Go light on Kraft if there’s no proof he knew the woman or women were employed against their will. That seems unlikely. When the NFL suspends players for using PEDs, even if the supplement was bought over the counter at a reputable vitamin store, players can’t use the excuse that they didn’t know a substance banned by the NFL was part of the supplement. Similarly, I doubt Goodell would accept a defense of “I didn’t know the women were part of a trafficking scheme.” Someone already involved in an illegal activity would not garner empathy for pleading ignorance there.

• Give Kraft a significant sanction—a multi-week (or longer) suspension from all Patriots and league activities, and a fine. This would show the league taking a stand against the burgeoning American issue of human-trafficking (it is already the cause of two highly respected NFL coaches, Mike Tomlin and Frank Reich), as well as showing the public it won’t kid-glove a high-profile owner.

I think it would be the latter. Again, the case is still unproven, and it’s highly likely Goodell will wait to see the corroborating evidence.

But if found culpable, Kraft might be wise to suggest a third option. He has been generous to important causes, small and large. In addition to a multi-week suspension, he could agree to lead an NFL initiative to help fight human trafficking, and provide significant seed money for the project. That might be one way to limit the amount of long-term personal damage. Deadspin reported that Kraft already has supported the fight against human trafficking with a $100,000 donation in 2015 to the Boston-based “My Life My Choice,” which supports human-trafficking victims. This is a desperately needed cause in the United States and the world, and Kraft’s renewed backing of the fight could be crucial in the fight.

Some would suggest Kraft deserves to have his ownership of the team stripped. I don’t see that happening. When Carolina owner Jerry Richardson was accused by former staff members of sexual and personal improprieties late in 2017 by Sports Illustrated, Richardson stepped away from the team and sold the franchise six weeks before the NFL fined him for his actions. Harboring a culture of intimidation inside his organization, and pressuring multiple female employees for sexual-related favors over a period of years, as Richardson did, could have led to him being stripped of his team. But Goodell never had to rule on that because Richardson voluntarily stepped away.

What would wound Kraft deeply, if found guilty, is knowing that damage he’d have done to his name and his brand—and it would be the third strike against his dynasty. The Spygate scandal tarnished Bill Belichick in 2007 (costing him $500,000 and the team a first-round draft choice), and the Deflategate scandal in 2015 got Tom Brady suspended for four games and cost the team another first-round pick. Because this violation has nothing to do with the competitive aspects of football, it wouldn’t be subject to draft-pick penalty. Goodell would hand down a penalty he feels is just. But Kraft being found guilty would be the third strike against the best long-term team in modern football history, even though it would have nothing to do with football.

One last point: If Goodell has to rule on Kraft, it will be watched as closely as any recent ruling he’s made—by the football community and by women in many communities monitoring a business that has talked a good game about women but has not always walked the walk. It’d be naïve to think Goodell’s clumsy handling of Rice would not be brought up to him by a largely new staff of PR operatives inside the NFL. That matters.

For now, the legal process will play out, in Jupiter, Fla., and in New England and inside the NFL offices in New York, and the consequences to a surprising story will be mulled. “We’re as equally stunned as anyone else,” Jupiter police chief Daniel Kerr said Friday. He’s not alone.

Good Story. Good Cause

I’ve made it a habit at the combine in Indianapolis to have an event to meet and greet people who love football or follow me on Twitter (or both), and hopefully to raise a few bucks for a good local cause, by listening to me and some of my national sportswriter friends talk football for a couple of hours. This year, I enlisted Colts coach Frank Reich to appear, so we could raise a little more money for a cause he is passionate about: Ascent 121, which aids victims of human trafficking in Indiana.

Reich’s a wonderful story—the underdog quarterback who won one of the greatest comebacks in NFL history, the 41-38 wild-card win in 1992 … the underdog coordinator who thought he’d never get an head-coaching job but finally did out of nowhere a year ago … and now the underdog head coach who led the Colts to a stunning playoff berth in 2018.

And, he would want you to know, a person who is championing an important cause in our society today—the fight against human trafficking.

You can come and hear the Reich story, in conversation with me, at Sun King Brewery Friday at 5 p.m. in downtown Indianapolis. When Reich has to leave to do Combine business at 6, I’ll host a football chat with some of my friends in the national media. And you’ll get a beer from Sun King, one of America’s great craft breweries.

Buy tickets here. Hope to see you there, to talk football and to support an important cause. If you’ve got any questions, please email me.

What I Learned

ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper has been covering the draft for 41 years, the last 36 for ESPN. This is something you don’t know: This is the first NFL Scouting Combine he will actually attend. ESPN has been given access to the on-field drills this year for the first time and so Kiper—who has watched the combine on TV for years—will go to Indianapolis and be present to see the underwear Olympics (the snide term by some scouts for the combine). Kiper, on what he’s learned about the important things in the scouting process leading up to the draft:

“I’ve learned it’s all important, to a degree. But there are a few things I pay attention to in every player. Arm length’s important. Getting your hands on guys, catching up when a guy gets past you. Even for corners it’s important. Marlon Humphrey of the Ravens, long arms. T.J. Watt, Myles Garrett, long arms. Jared Allen—long arms were a big part of his game. I like the 3-cone drill, because it measures change of direction, and that’s so important at every position. I like speed, at every position. Terron Armstead was a 4.71 (in the 40-yard dash) guy and went in the third round. Darius Slay ran 4.36 and went in the second. There’s reasons for that, but speed and quickness is valuable at every position.

“I think you’ve got to guard against changing your board a lot now, when the coaches get involved. Not that they don’t know these [prospects], but you’ve got to trust your scouts and the work they’ve done all year going from campus to campus.

“I’ve learned how important the undrafted free agents are every year. Maybe a guy you liked a lot didn’t have a great senior year. Maybe he was hurt, or maybe he played hurt. Lots of guys play hurt in football. Was he playing through a hamstring? An ankle? You’ve got to be able to look at that and see through it. There are a lot of outliers in football, guys who might not fit or check every box. I wish I could just one year get the chance to sign 15 to 20 undrafted free agents after the seventh round, because I know some of those guys would be a lot better than not being drafted.

“I’ve made mistakes analyzing players. I really liked Jimmy Clausen when he came out of Notre Dame, and I was wrong about him. I thought he’d be accurate and tough and competitive and that would make up for some of his arm issues. But in this business you’re going to make mistakes. Part of the job. I remember back in 1996, the Rams had two first-round picks and took Lawrence Phillips and Eddie Kennison with the sixth and 18th picks. I said right then they should have taken Eddie George and Marvin Harrison, and they could have gotten both guys where they picked.”

Numbers Game 30

Michael David Smith wrote about how the NFL should reconsider the system of compensatory draft choices, in part because it encourages smart teams to shed good but often not great players in free agency so they can save cap room and recoup valuable draft picks the following spring. He’s absolutely right. Compensatory picks are awarded to teams a year after losing big-money free-agents.

Let’s look at this year’s top 11 Compensatory Picks, seven in round three, four in round four. That is all of the extra picks awarded in the first 170 picks in the 2019 draft. You’ll see why the Compensatory Pick system might need to be revised.

• Compensatory Picks awarded in round three and four, total: 11.

• Compensatory Picks awarded to 2018 playoffs teams in rounds three and four: 7.

The picks awarded in rounds three and four, followed by the 2018 record of that team, plus the player that team lost to get the pick:

Round 3

Washington (7-9, Kirk Cousins)

New England (14-5, Nate Solder)

Los Angeles Rams (15-4, Trumaine Johnson)

Los Angeles Rams (15-4, Sammy Watkins)

Carolina (7-9, Andrew Norwell)

New England (14-5, Malcolm Butler)

Baltimore (10-7, Ryan Jensen)

Round 4

Indianapolis (11-7, Donte Moncrief)

Dallas (11-7, Anthony Hitchens)

Atlanta (7-9, Taylor Gabriel)

Philadelphia (10-8, Trey Burton)

I mean, look at that list of lost players and tell me that the smart teams don’t use Compensatory Picks as a farm system to replenish their roster and get rid of guys whose new contracts, by and large, don’t come close to matching their mediocre (collectively) 2018 production.

Factoidness

The betting site BetOnline listed these odds for possible length of suspension against New England owner Robert Kraft:

1-4 weeks: 2-1.

5-8 weeks: 5-4.

9-17 weeks: 7-5.

What a country.

Advice for Kevin Colbert. From Jason K. of Woodland Hills, Calif.: “I understand Pittsburgh not wanting to help their division or help New England by trading them a top five receiver, but is that smart? With the Pats having six picks in the first three rounds, they could blow the doors off Pittsburgh with a big-time offer. I’ll never understand teams limiting their scope for a trade.”

I think you’re misreading New England’s team-building ways. Antonio Brown wants a new contract, with most or all of it guaranteed, and he’s 31 in July, and he’s been an idiot for the last two months, and the Patriots haven’t paid big money to an offensive player other than Tom Brady (well, maybe Rob Gronkowski, but he makes big money for a tight end, and Brown would want loads more). I don’t see it, but we’ll see if Bill Belichick breaks his way of doing things.

Could there be an officiating scandal in the NFL? From Kraig S., of Amarillo, Texas: “I read the ESPN story about former NBA official Tim Donaghy and the possibility he fixed games to benefit those gambling on the games he officiated. I am not looking to throw fuel to another conspiracy theory about missed calls and favoritism. What I am more interested in is what the NFL does to ensure the integrity of its games. Does the NFL have standards/practices in place to try and catch or avoid ‘game fixing’ by its officials?”

The NFL does do a lot to ensure purity of officiating, but never say never. I’ve always thought it would be very hard to fix an NFL game, unless you had a full seven-man officiating crew on board. Suppose a sharp guy paid off a back judge before a big game, and the game never had any sort of contested call deep downfield and the game was decided at other areas of the field. What good would it do to have the back judge in the bag? To be safe, I called former NFL ref Terry McAulay the other day, and he told me the league does an FBI-type background check on each prospective official, and then once every three years after that; does a credit check regularly to see that no irregularities are happening in an officials bank or investment accounts; mandates that each officials be checked out by the local NFL team’s security chief; prohibits all officials from entering a casino during the season; prohibits all officials from gambling on any sports event. “I’m very, very confident the level of integrity of the NFL officials is beyond reproach,” McAulay told me. It’s not something I’ve heard very much about in my 35 years covering the league.

The restrictive pool of head coaches. From Bob T. of Woodbury, Minn.: “Is the NFL putting too much emphasis on the young coaching push based on the results of basically one coach [Sean McVay]?”

I think so. Bill Parcells told me last month he fears that the young coaches being hired are smart X-and-O guys but don’t have the experience leading a room full of players—because many of them have never had to do it before. It’s hard, he said, to learn that stuff on the job.

10 Things I Think I Think

1. I think I’ll take a crack at Antonio Brown’s landing spot here, keeping a few things in mind: He’s significantly hurt his market value (no kidding) since going AWOL from the Steelers the last week of the regular season and since going all scorched-earth on the Steelers in the last six weeks. The fact that GM Kevin Colbert would say he’s had three teams reach out about trading for the first player in history to catch 100 balls six years in a row tells you the market on Brown will be limited. (Three? If Brown didn’t have his baggage, it’d be 13.) But here’s my top choices for his smartest landing spot:

• Carolina. New owner David Tepper, a Pittsburgh guy, went to Pitt and then Carnegie Mellon, and donated $55 million to CMU, which now has a Tepper School of Business in his honor. He bought a 5 percent stake in the Steelers in 2009, preceding his purchase of the Panthers last year. So he’ll know the holes in Brown’s persona, but he’ll also know the difference Brown could make in a passing game that needs a downfield threat. Brown has averaged 114 catches and 1,524 yards a year for the past six years with the deep-armed Ben Roethlisberger, and he’ll be motivated to keep the distractions to a minimum so he can earn a new deal. Tepper is motivated to inject new life into a 24-25 team since Carolina’s Super Bowl appearance three years ago. Though GM Marty Hurney is a conservative type by nature, I think he could be convinced to take a shot on this get-rich-quick scheme. It’d thrill Cam Newton too.

• Washington. A smart guy in the league told me the other day: “Look for the desperate teams with Brown.” What team is more desperate than Washington, which is hemorrhaging fans, has no idea who the 2019 quarterback will be, has no idea who the 2020 coach will be, hasn’t won a playoff game in 14 years, and has an embattled owner searching for anything that will get his team out of the muck and mire of mediocrity? This also fits the Pittsburgh plan of wanting to send Brown out of the AFC. The problem, obviously, would be finding a quarterback to get the ball to Brown. But Washington’s a team that loves to win the offseason and hasn’t done so in a while. I’d be surprised if Bruce Allen and Kevin Colbert don’t talk about Brown.

• Tampa Bay. Dot-connecting. DeSean Jackson wants a new start out of Tampa. The new coach of the Bucs, Bruce Arians, was the Steelers’ play-caller in 2011, when Brown had his breakout NFL season. Arians wants to throw the ball deep more than any head coach in football. Makes sense to me.

• New York Jets. Makes a ton of sense, because the Jets aren’t averse to spending big in free agency so why would they be averse to making a big deal? I’ve maintained that Robby Anderson and a fairly high pick would be a fair trade, because it would rid the Steelers of the Brown headache and, though the Jets and Steelers meet this fall in New Jersey, wouldn’t mean the Steelers would be dealing him to anything but an occasional on-field rival. This is the franchise where Santonio Holmes went to disappear nine years ago. Anderson and JuJu Smith-Schuster would be a formidable receiver duo for the next few years too.

• Oakland. The Raiders have five first-round picks in the next two drafts (their own two, Chicago’s in 2019 and 2020, and the Cowboys’ this year), and Jon Gruden is a trading machine. Though it’s an AFC team, they don’t play each other till at least 2020.

• The others. I don’t see San Francisco, unless Jerry Rice gets hired as GM … Arizona could send the first pick in the second round this year, straight up, which seems like a fair deal … Green Bay could make Brown the receiver very happy. Not impossible, but hard to see such a straight-laced organization with a young head coach trying to find his footing taking the plunge.

2. I think the Rams are praying left tackle Andrew Whitworth comes back for one more season (at $10.7 million in the last year of his three-year free-agent contract). For now, the 37-year-old Whitworth plans to meet with the team post-combine to discuss his future. The team could really use one more year of excellent play and offensive-line stability out of him. If free-agent left guard Rodger Saffold leaves for a payday, the Rams would certainly want the stability of Whitworth on the left side of the line, perhaps moving 2018 third-rounder Joseph Noteboom into Saffold’s spot if Whitworth stays. But if Whitworth goes, the pressure could be on Noteboom, a three-year left-tackle starter at TCU, to slide into Whitworth’s spot.

3. I think, speaking of intriguing Rams free agents, I expect Ndamukong Suh and safety Lamarcus Joyner to sign elsewhere, and pass-rusher Dante Fowler Jr., could also go. And if Saffold, Suh, Joyner and perhaps Fowler sign for big money collectively and the Rams don’t venture into free agency much, they could have a replay of this year’s Compensatory Pick load. L.A., as I showed earlier, got two third-round comp-picks by letting Trumaine Johnson and Sammy Watkins walk, and those two players were major disappointments with the Jets and Chiefs, respectively. Of the four potential defectors, Fowler is probably the player whose loss would be felt most in 2019, because the Rams just don’t have an edge presence on their roster after Fowler.

4. I think I don’t have a lot of dealings with college coaches, and so when I do, I like to ask them questions other than the one I might have reached out for. So last week I asked Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley if he was tempted to pursue an NFL head-coaching job this year, and whether he might be in the future. The reply of the well-respected Riley: “I certainly wasn’t tempted at all this year. I would say right now it wouldn’t surprise me at all if I am a college lifer. I think it’ll be interesting how a lot of things go on from here … if there’s a lot of changes in both games. Football is evolving; there’s a lot of changes obviously at the NFL level right now. There’s a lot of changes with all the transfers and recruiting and all the different things going on at the college level. You never know how those games are going to evolve. I might’ve been tempted honestly had I not been at a place like Oklahoma. But this is one of the best jobs there is in football. Like I’ve said before, I’ll never say never. I never want to promise things that I can’t 1,000 percent guarantee. It’s not something that really tempts me at all right now.”

5. I think that’s a no, sort of, the same way Stanford’s David Shaw is a no. And those are the two most respected NFL head-coaching candidates on the offensive side of the ball in college football today.

6. I think, regarding throwing or not throwing or not working out on-field at the combine: It doesn’t matter. At all. I’ve said this annually for years: I have never heard an NFL GM or coach say, after that draft, We downgraded Player X on our board because he didn’t work out at the combine. So big deal if Dwayne Haskins throws and Kyler Murray throws (and I don’t even know if that will be the outcome).

7. I think the more I think about it, the more logical Nick Foles-to-Jacksonville sounds. Unless, of course, the fun dream scenario happens: Jon Gruden picks Kyler Murray and trades Derek Carr to Jacksonville in the middle of the first round April 25.

8. I think I don’t normally write about media relations staffs, but this occurred to me watching Lester Holt lead the night news Friday with the Robert Kraft story: Whatever Kraft pays Stacey James and his Patriots PR staff, it’s not enough.

9. I think watching the Christian Hackenberg lowlights in the AAF is downright depressing.

10. I think these are my other thoughts of the week:

a. Story of the Week: by Patricia Mazzei of the New York Times, on the day spa raided by the police in Jupiter, Fla., the scandal that ensnared Patriots owner Robert Kraft.

b. Sheriff William D. Snyder of Martin County, Fla., deflected blame from the trafficked women and onto the customers of the spa. “The monsters are the men,” Snyder told Mazzei.

c. TV Series of the Week: “Surviving R. Kelly,” the Lifetime series that focused the law on the rapper and led to his arrest late in the week. Top-notch journalism by Lifetime.

d. Political Series of the Week: “The Circus: Inside the Greatest Political Show on Earth,” on Showtime, is one of the coolest shows about Washington that I’ve seen. It’s real, and it’s spectacular, and it shows how D.C. really works.

e. Very rarely do I see any event a second time, but I made an exception with family in New York last week. We saw “Come From Away” a few months after I’d seen it the first time. It was just as emotional and satisfying the second time.

f. You don’t know “Come From Away?” It’s a Broadway play about the tiny Canadian town, Gander, Newfoundland, that welcomed thousands of stranded travelers for days after 9/11, when U.S. airspace was closed an international flights needed a place to land. When you lose faith in humanity, see “Come From Away.”

g. Coffeenerdness: I’ve been on tea, an ocean of it, for about 16 days, trying to get well after the football season. Tazo Orange, with a thick slice of squeezed lemon, is the best.

h. Beernerdness: Not been in the mood for much beer in recent days, but I did have a Kronenbourg 1664 (Kronenbourg Brewery, Strasbourg, France) after seeing “Come From Away,” and it was marvelous. Best served ice cold. Like revenge.

i. The lousy thing about being sick for more than two weeks? You spend a couple of days, at least, every week working out and staying in some sort of shape anticipating having more time to do so in the off-season. And then it’s over. You’re back to ground zero. I hate that.

j. I wouldn’t get too fired up about the pitch clock ruining baseball.

k. RIP Peter Tork, the cool guy in the Monkees, who passed away from tongue cancer last week.

l. Hey, when you’re 10, and you memorize every word to every top 40 song (as I did in 1967), songs like “Daydream Believer” stick with you for a half century.

m. And RIP Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe. So many of you have told me you play 20 minutes of hooky from work on Monday morning to read this column. (Which is the biggest continuous honor of my career.) On so many Sundays, when I should be spending time researching some NFL thing or other, I did the exact same with Cafardo’s Boston Globe baseball column. I’m a baseball nerd, made that way in part by the Peter Gammons notes column he invented for the Globe, and continued in Gammonsian fashion by Cafardo. Nick died suddenly at Red Sox camp Thursday morning. He was 62. I knew him only a bit, but all those who knew him well said he was the kindest and most generous guy in the business.

n. I love the fact that Cafardo’s last story was about a nice guy: World Series MVP Steve Pearce, back with the Red Sox for one more season.

o. Here is how the story ended, with Pearce talking about what it was like for him to return to the team he won the World Series with—the last words Nick Cafardo ever wrote:

“This is what baseball is all about,” Pearce said. “I’ve been a lot of places. When you find that perfect place to play baseball, you know it. This was it for me. For me, it was a no-brainer. If they wanted me back, I was willing to do what it takes to do it. I didn’t have to look around very long. In fact, I didn’t have to look at all. We worked it out and now I get to defend a title with the team I want to be with.”

And the Red Sox, throwing age aside, got themselves an MVP. Most Valuable Player and Most Valuable Person.

The Adieu Haiku 40

Hey David Tepper:

Put your mark on the Panthers.

Get Antonio."

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox television series, took to Instagram and posted a video of Smollett holding a giggling baby boy with the message: ""All your lil homies got you ... We love the hell outta you.""

The post Saturday came a day after ""Empire"" producers announced that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season, saying cast and crew were affected and they made the move ""to avoid further disruption on the set.""

The series, which is on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. Seven episodes already were completed before Smollett was charged last week with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Police have said Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men attacked him last month in downtown Chicago, hurling slurs and looping a rope around his neck. Investigators said he planned the hoax, soliciting the help of a friend and the friend's brother, because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett denies the allegations.

Some ""Empire"" cast members posted supportive messages on social media after Smollett claimed he was attacked. Fox also publicly supported Smollett after the initial claims.

Howard's post generated more than 385,000 views by midday Sunday and countless comments, both critical and supportive.

In response to one of the critics, Howard wrote: ""Sorry you feel that way but that's the only Jussie that I know. The Jussie that I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgement is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone that I've called my son for 5 years. It's God's job to judge and it is ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There's nothing more harmful than a fake friend! Real talk."""

Jussie Smollett, #MeToo and the presumption of innocence

By Eric London

25 February 2019

On February 22, the World Socialist Web Site published an article, “The Jussie Smollett controversy: Must all accusations be believed?” The commentary argued that the collapse of Smollett’s claim to have been attacked by racist thugs in Chicago exposed the right-wing character of the #MeToo campaign, which asserts that the accuser must always be believed, lack of corroborating evidence notwithstanding.

One reader, commenting on the article, wrote that the WSWS was hypocritical for calling Smollett a liar while defending his presumption of innocence in the criminal case against him.

“So Smollett is a liar but also has the right to the presumption of innocence?”, the commenter, Urfubar, wrote. “This can’t both be true. You can’t presume someone innocent of a felony you just declared guilty of a felony. Either Smollett is a liar who falsified a police report, or he’s innocent until proven guilty. Pick one.”

This comment provides the opportunity to further probe the anti-democratic rationale and reactionary implications of the #MeToo campaign.

As a preliminary matter, the WSWS opposes Smollett’s former supporters who are now rushing to condemn him just as blindly as they rushed to believe him three weeks ago. We oppose the criminal prosecution and the premature decision by Fox to write Smollett’s character out of the show “Empire” before his guilt has been proven. The efforts by the media to make an example of Smollett before he has been found guilty are hypocritical and serve to confuse, not clarify.

However, the facts that have emerged make clear that Smollett lied about the January 29 attack. He claimed that two white men he did not know hit him, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck.

Dozens of security cameras at or near the scene of the alleged crime failed to show any attack, and the two men seen leaving turned out to be brothers, who are friends of Smollett and of Nigerian descent. The brothers had bleach (which Smollett alleged was thrown on him) and magazines with missing pages (Smollett alleged he received a death threat with letters cut out of magazines) at their home.

Financial records also show that the brothers purchased the same piece of rope that was later found on Smollett’s neck, which the pair is shown on closed-circuit video buying at a store. Phone records show that days before the alleged attack, Smollett texted one of the brothers: “Might need your help on the low [i.e., in secret]. You around to meet up and talk face to face?”

The WSWS correctly characterized and condemned Smollett’s selfish, careerist behavior, which only feeds the growth of the extreme-right and casts doubt on future allegations of right-wing vigilante attacks.

But does this mean he forfeits the right to be presumed innocent? Does it mean he is necessarily guilty of a crime?

The answer to both questions is “no.” Smollett has the right to challenge the charges against him in court and the evidence presented. Moreover, even if the defense accepts the specific allegation—that Smollett filed a false report—a trial such as this, in the course of a vigorous defense, invariably raises issues as to the significance and context of these facts, which could lead to a verdict of not guilty.

For example, §5/26-1(5) of the Illinois criminal code penalizes anyone who “knowingly… transmits or causes to be transmitted a false report to any public safety agency without the reasonable grounds necessary to believe that transmitting the report is necessary for the safety and welfare of the public.”

Central to Smollett’s legal defense could be his state of mind. To be guilty of a crime, a defendant must have the requisite level of intent. In this case, he must “ know ” there is no “reasonable ground” to believe the report is “necessary for the safety and welfare of the public.”

This presents a complex question. Did Smollett perhaps convince himself in the present political climate that his race and sexual orientation justify his actions and make them “reasonable?” Did he think bringing attention to bigotry and right-wing attacks was “necessary” for the public welfare, even if this particular “attack” was invented?

Or, was Smollett blinded by ambition and acting under a passion and pressure that so clouded his judgment that he could not “intend,” with clear mind, to carry out a crime?

Could he argue in court that he was operating in conformity with the conventions of a sick and corrupt society that encourages professionals to use their racial and sexual identities in opportunistic ways? Could he say he was an avid reader of the New York Times, which tells him it is “reasonable” to assume accusations must be believed no matter what? Could he say that the #MeToo hysteria has made the reasonable unreasonable and the unreasonable reasonable, and that he can’t tell which way is up?

The prosecution will claim, as the proponents of #MeToo always argue, that the accused is a monster and that monsters always have evil intent.

But Smollett has the right to exercise all the rights that flow from the presumption of innocence. He is protected from the state by the Sixth Amendment, which grants him the right to present his case to a jury and cross-examine the Nigerian brothers to examine their motives. If the case goes to trial, Smollett’s attorneys will have the benefit of voir dire to keep prosecutors from loading the panel with prejudiced panelists.

The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments mean the judge may bar jurors from reading the New York Times so their ability to objectively hear testimony does not become clouded by the media hate campaign. The judge will tell jurors to ignore evidence, even if it is relevant, if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger that it is unfair, prejudicial, confusing or misleading.

How critical these protections are and yet how dangerous it is that none of them are available to the targets of the #MeToo campaign, whose lives and careers are ruined in the court of public opinion! The #MeToo proponents explicitly call for believing all accusers, having adopted the slogan “I believe.” Asking for corroborating evidence is “victim blaming.” Asking accusers about their intentions is “victim shaming.” If the accused claims innocence, it is presented as further proof of guilt.

It is precisely in such cases, however, that presumption of innocence and due process are so critical. Even in cases where everything appears clear on the surface—or, especially in such cases—it is in the course of a trial that the underlying complexities emerge.

The campaign to reject these basic democratic conceptions has been deliberately whipped up by the most powerful and profitable media corporations, working in conjunction with Democratic Party strategists and the editors of newspapers like the filthy New York Times. To advance their own money-grubbing, right-wing agendas, these powerful forces are creating a hysterical mood by playing on the prejudices, emotions, insecurities and ambitions of the affluent upper-middle class like keys on a piano.

Passionate public moods demanding vengeance have long been the vehicle for the most dangerous assaults on democratic rights. Hundreds of African Americans were lynched based on allegations by lying white women. One such woman, 85-year-old Carolyn Bryant Donham, is alive and free today. The lie she told in August 1955 was “believed” and, as a result, 14-year-old Emmett Till was tortured and killed, his mangled body dumped in the river.

Progressive politics has always fought such right-wing popular sentiments, even where the accused is clearly guilty. In the famous 1924 death penalty case of Leopold and Loeb, defense attorney Clarence Darrow argued against hanging two young men who admitted to murdering a 14-year-old boy. The newspapers were demanding the boys be hanged and attacking due process as an obstacle to justice.

In a democratic society, Darrow said, the court must ignore the clamor in the press and the reactionary hidden agendas of those braying for blood. It meant, instead, “that you must appraise every influence that moves [the defendants], the civilization where they live, their living, their society, all society which enters into the making of a child.”

The same principle was captured by Theodore Dreiser in his masterpiece An American Tragedy. Clyde Griffiths’ defense attorney, Belknap, made an appeal to jurors inundated with hysterical calls to sentence young Clyde to death:

“And I venture to say that if by some magic of the spoken word I could at this moment strip from your eye the substance of all the cruel thoughts and emotions which have been attributed to him [Clyde] by a clamorous and mistaken and I might say (if I had not been warned not to do so) politically biased prosecution, you could no more see him in the light that you do than you could rise out of that box and fly through those windows.”

Irreconcilable opposition to such witch hunts in the face of popular pressure is the trademark of principled socialist politics. Leon Trotsky insisted that socialists are socialists only insofar as they maintain “complete and absolute independence of bourgeois public opinion.”

Writing in 1922, the co-leader of the Russian Revolution described bourgeois public opinion as “composed of two parts: first, of inherited views, actions, and prejudices which represent the fossilized experience of the past, a thick layer of irrational banality and useful stupidity; and second, of the intricate machinery and clever management necessary for the mobilization of patriotic feeling and moral indignation, of national enthusiasm, altruist sentiment, and other kinds of lies and deceptions.”

These words may as well have been written about the #MeToo movement, which genuine socialists rightfully oppose.

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) not only believed black and openly gay actor Jussie Smollett’s tale of being attacked by two N-word-spouting homophobic Trump-supporters, she — and many other big-name Democrats — knew exactly whom to blame.

Waters said: “I know Jussie. I love him. His family’s a friend of mine. I know his sisters, I met his mom and I called already to Jazz, one of the sisters, to talk to her about what’s happening, what’s going on. … I’m pleased that he’s doing okay. But we have to understand this is happening for a reason. Why, all of a sudden, do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have a picnic while black, and being attacked? It’s coming from the president of the United States. He’s dog whistling every day. He’s separating and dividing, and he is basically emboldening those folks who feel this way.”

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who became famous by falsely accusing an assistant district attorney of raping a black teenage girl, weighed in. He said: “(The Smollett attack) is only a reminder of the times that we are living in, that people feel empowered to express their hate and feel there will be no accountability. … The president should have said, ‘My brand shouldn’t stand for that.’ This hate-filled climate is set by … the president of the United States, who gets the award for climate setting, if he is not at fault for a direct act.”

Isn’t it good news that the story is alleged to be false? Isn’t it good news that Trump-supporting goons are not patrolling the streets at night, armed with bleach and a noose, to find, attack, whitewash and lynch black and gay Trump-bashers? A PeopleTV host actually said she was “hoping” and “praying” that Smollett’s story was true.

Why did so many uncritically buy Smollett’s story? One reason is that an Axios poll last November found that 61 percent of Democrats believe Republicans are “racist/ bigoted/sexist.” Thirty-one percent of Republicans feel that way about Democrats. And most Democrats and members of the media believe Trump is a racist. So why doubt such a juicy story that falsely advances two narratives? Trump is Exhibit A that racism remains a major problem in America. And if Trump is a “racist,” therefore so are his supporters.

As to the belief that racism remains a serious problem in America, can we agree that nirvana is not an option? In a nation of 330 million people, bad actors abound. After all, one survey in 2017 found that 7 percent of adult Americans believe chocolate milk comes from brown cows. That works out to over 17 million adults. And a 1997 Gallup poll found that 4 percent of Americans believed Elvis was still alive.

But today’s definition of “race relations” pretty much comes down to this: how black people feel about white people and how white people feel about how black people feel about white people. Racism has so receded as an impediment to progress that new terms became necessary to describe offensive “racist” behavior, such as “microaggressions.”

The Justice Department inspector general, Michael Horowitz — appointed by former President Barack Obama, not President Trump — charged McCabe with lying three times under oath about having leaked to the newspapers, and not for a national security reason, just to make himself look good. While the media relish the idea of jail time for Trump aides caught lying to investigators, this man gets a red carpet and a pat on the back.

McCabe’s book tour has created headlines like this, from a CNN interview: “McCabe: It’s Possible Trump Is a Russian Asset.” Let’s be blunt. This is as credible as birtherism. It’s exactly as responsible and reliable as broadcasting a headline that says, “Trump: It’s Possible Obama Was Born in Kenya.” McCabe is the Jussie Smollett of the Justice Department.

McCabe’s publisher, St. Martin’s Press, is reaping a bonanza of book advertising. Thirty minutes on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” 15 minutes on NPR’s “Morning Edition,” 24 minutes on ABC’s “The View,” an hour on NPR’s “Fresh Air,” 30 minutes on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360,” 40 minutes on MSNBC’s “The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,” 20 minutes on CBS’ “Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Then more MSNBC: On Feb. 20 alone, he had 40 minutes on “Morning Joe,” another 40 minutes on “Deadline: White House” and then 20 minutes on “All In with Chris Hayes.” Then came the “PBS NewsHour.”

There’s an obvious term for a media that offers a shameless partisan liar this much free advertising/mudslinging. It’s the “Opposition Party.”

McCabe despises Trump. The press (and Hollywood) despises Trump. The media love McCabe. Most of these journalists have presented McCabe as nonpartisan and skipped asking (or even reporting) about how his wife, Jill McCabe, ran for the Virginia state Senate as a Democrat in 2015, and how Clinton crony Terry McAuliffe directed almost $500,000 in PAC money to her campaign. This created an obvious conflict of interest if McCabe was later working on the Hillary Clinton email probe. The media forced then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia probe, but McCabe never recused. It was never an issue.

The toughest pushback on McCabe’s lying came from … Meghan McCain on “The View.” She said to his face: “I don’t believe you’re a reliable narrator. And I’m not convinced this is not just some kind of PR campaign to stop yourself from getting indicted. You were fired at the recommendation of the FBI.” Republican members of Congress like Rep. Jim Jordan have sounded this same alarm — including new charges of lying — but their objections aren’t included in the gushy interviews.

McCabe’s lying under oath also drew several minutes on NPR’s “Morning Edition,” and even then, NPR cut the interview into two segments and eagerly promoted the other half — the Trump-and-Russia half.

Most interviewers flunked. “60 Minutes” and “Morning Joe” strenuously made excuses for lying under oath. Anderson Cooper arrived on the subject only as the interview wrapped up. NPR “Fresh Air” host Terry Gross tossed one perfunctory question. MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell and Nicolle Wallace didn’t ask a single question about it over their 40-minute interviews.

Unsurprisingly, comedian Stephen Colbert did worse than avoid the question. As he asked McCabe to grade the press on their Trump-scandal coverage, he joked with McCabe that he was “under oath right now.” Those words mean nothing to McCabe. That’s why he smirked.

Apparently, we are too indulgent of those who can claim victim status, a state especially rife among students. The story goes that this has turned us all into eternal babies, coddling us, protecting us from “micro aggressions” and signalling an erosion of individual grit and autonomy in favour of mimsy whining.

In an effort to invert unfair power structures, some claim, victimhood culture has only succeeded in replacing them with different unfair power structures, where those who used to be at the bottom now hold the whip hand over those who used to be at the top. Women terrify men, who are forever fearful an offhand remark will become a harassment lawsuit, and racial minorities secure jobs at the expense of white people the moment their unusual names are spotted on a CV. The writer Lionel Shriver called it “privileging the disadvantaged”. Shriver also told BBC Radio 4 that white men in the UK are on the bottom rung of society, because they are considered to be the most powerful demographic (reader, I can reveal they are). Victimhood culture advocates engage in a lot of doublethink.

Academic John McWhorter writes that the story reveals “something else modern America is about: victimhood chic.""

I have tried to find this victimhood culture in real life and am sad to report that its dividends are elusive. In my experience, the most extreme manifestation is people being mildly annoying on social media by constantly prefacing their thoughts by alluding to their race, gender or sexual orientation, or assuming that people are being rude to them because of their identity. But, despite the rarity of victim culture in the wild, when it emerged that American actor Jussie Smollett may have fabricated a racist and homophobic attack on himself in Chicago, it was immediately obvious to many why they thought he did it. It wasn’t because he was a creep or a sociopath or an attention seeker: it was because of victimhood culture.

Victimhood culture is one of those phenomena, like “political correctness gone mad”, that isn’t a real thing, but has nevertheless been adopted by the right and the left, and made mainstream with little questioning as to why. It wasn’t just Fox News and Trump supporters who relished the opportunity to point out that Smollett’s actions were a manifestation of our fetish for the victim. African-American academic John McWhorter writes in the Atlantic that the Smollett story reveals “something else modern America is about: victimhood chic. Future historians and anthropologists will find this aspect of early-21st-century America peculiar, intriguing, and sad.” In the National Review, Andy Ngo goes further to claim that “because of the mainstreaming of academia’s victimhood culture, we are now in a place where we place more value on being a victim than on being heroic, charitable, or even kind”. CNN hosted a talk show entitled “Jussie Smollett and the victim culture”.

This reaction is in itself a tell. The eagerness to extrapolate from one incident and make sweeping statements about how society is just too nice to victims and therefore encourages such fakery shows that society isn’t actually predisposed to being nice to victims at all. It is a miserly conditional sympathy that is withdrawn the moment victims let us down. All the Smollett case has done is give people an excuse to default to their comfort zone, to believe that all allegations of homophobia and racism are suspect, probably overblown or made up. While the Smollett story developed, two other stories broke: the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that there were now more than 1,000 hate groups operational in the US, and the FBI foiled a plot by a white nationalist to murder Democratic party politicians. At one point, CNN cut away from live coverage of an FBI press conference about this to rerun old footage of Smollett news.

This insistence on the centrality of “victimhood culture” is symptomatic of a society that is intolerant of victims – waiting to pounce, to roll eyes, scoff, and ideally (but alas rarely), find a gotcha moment to prove that victim narratives are suspect. A focus on the minutiae of safe spaces and trigger warnings (which the BBC has put before violent dramas for decades), is an overreaction to the baby steps societies are taking to recognise grievances that were, until recently, considered trivial.

Smollett is not the hill I am going to die on, but his is a story, if one steps back and removes it from tribal infighting, that is ubiquitous. It even has its own cautionary Aesop’s fable on the dangers of crying wolf.

How many people do you know in your own personal and professional lives whom you suspect have embellished, exaggerated or made up illnesses or inflated relationship troubles? How awkward is it for you to point this out without sounding like a jerk when it seems that everyone else is lapping it up?

Earlier this month, the New Yorker ran an entire profile on the jaw-dropping lies of writer Dan Mallory, who managed to elicit support and indulgence from academic supervisors, employers and friends by faking several terminal illnesses, and inventing the death of his mother and the suicide of his brother. But still people were too cautious of appearing churlish to accuse him of lying. There is even a pathological manifestation of the condition called “factitious victimisation”, of which Munchausen syndrome is an extreme version.

The only pattern here is one of people taking advantage of natural sympathetic responses to adversity because they are mendacious or damaged. It’s just rare that they are high-profile celebrities. Smollett is an aberration; victimhood culture is the real hoax.

Donald Trump Jr took at swipe at Christine Blasey Ford, Jussie Smollett, and Nathan Phillips on Sunday night, shortlisting the trio in a spoof Oscars category for ‘politically motivated hate hoaxes’.

The meme posted by president’s eldest son read: ‘Cast your vote now. The nominees for best performance in a politically motivated hate hoax are…’

The caption included the hashtags #oscars, #Oscars19, and #AcademyAward.

The ‘nominees’ in the meme are Ford, Smollett, and Phillips.

Ford is the woman who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school.

The allegations surfaced during the confirmation process which followed in the weeks after President Trump nominated Kavanaugh to fill the seat vacated by retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.

Ford testified before a Senate committee under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her at an alcohol-filled party in high school more than 30 years ago.

Smollett is the star of the hit Fox drama Empire who was arrested this past week for allegedly concocting a story that he was assaulted in a homophobic and racist attack.

He told Chicago police that before dawn on January 29, he was beaten by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

Smollett claimed the men tied a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him.

But a subsequent investigation by the Chicago Police Department found that the actor allegedly staged the attack.

He has been charged with disorderly conduct, a felony that carries with it a maximum sentence of three years in prison.

Initial speculation that the attackers were Trump supporters outraged supporters of the president, who feel vindicated in light of Smollett’s arrest.

Phillips is the Native American man who was seen on film confronting a group of Catholic school teens from Kentucky on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial last month.

Initially, photos and video from the scene seemed to show a group of teens in red ‘Make America Great Again’ hats smirking at and mocking the elderly Phillips while he played on a traditional Native American drum.

The initial impression ignited outrage, with many blasting the kids for being racist.

But later footage added more nuance to the narrative, as it was learned that it was Phillips who approached the teens after they had gotten into an altercation with a group of Black Hebrew Israelites.

Phillips had claimed that the kids were a ‘mob’ who were threatening the Black Israelites, but this turned out to be false.

The revelations prompted many who initially attacked the teens on social media to recant."

By half time of last Thursday’s Rockets-Lakers game on TNT, Charles Barkley got word that a black man, actor Jussie Smollett, had hired two black men to masquerade as MAGA muggers, and had paid them with a check. For the NBA great it was too much and he told the nation “do not commit crimes with checks.” Late-night comics signaled support, but Democrats and their media allies weren’t laughing.

As the fakery unfolded, presidential hopefuls Cory Booker and Kamala Harris charged that the attack on Smollett was “a modern-day lynching.” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi called it a “racist, homophobic attack.”

On CNN, Van Jones was hailing Smollett as a “Jackie Robinson” type, ironic in that Smollett was hardly the first African American gay actor, entering the field long after Roscoe Lee Browne, Paul Winfield and others. After baseball, Robinson was also a highly successful businessman, and never involved in any scandal.

CNN’s Keith Boykin explained that Nazis march in Charlottesville, people send pipe bombs and white nationalists plot terror attacks. “When a story comes up however implausible it seems on its face, unfortunately,” he said, “we live in a world now where these things are even possible.” So as Boykin implies, the actual facts of Smollett’s case are of little or no concern. This dynamic is on display among prominent democrats.

Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren knows Native Americans exist, therefore she can claim to be Cherokee. As the Washington Post recently discovered, on her 1986 Texas bar registration card, Warren listed herself as “American Indian.” Yet, even after that, Elizabeth Warren is running for president of the United States, and no prominent Democrat charges that her fakery renders her ineligible.

In similar style, Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal knows that military combat veterans exist, therefore he can claim to be one. Blumenthal claimed he served in Vietnam but he didn’t In fact, as the New York Times, noted, Blumenthal obtained at least five military deferments, took repeated steps to avoid going to war, and took a job in the Nixon White House. For his part, POTUS 44, formerly known as Barry Soetoro, has been rather quiet about the fakery of his fellow Democrats, with good reason.

According to official biographer, Pulitzer Prize-winner David Garrow, “Dreams from My Father was not a memoir or an autobiography; it was instead, in multitudinous ways, without any question a work of historical fiction (Garrow’s italics).” The book “employed the techniques and literary license of a novel, and its most important composite character was the narrator himself.”

Garrow easily identify the Dreams character “Frank” as Frank Marshall Davis, because the former Barry Soetoro did so himself. Garrow includes the “Pop” poem but explains that “Davis’ Communist background plus his kinky exploits made him politically radioactive.” That is why Barry needed the “historical fiction” of Dreams from My Father, the back story about the Kenyan foreign student who supposedly “bequeathed his name” to the American.

A year after Garrow’s massive Rising Star: The Making of Barack Obama, Iran deal promoter Ben Rhodes came out with The World As It Is: A Memoir of the Obama White House. The White House insider claims he read Dreams from My Father multiple times but fails to note that Garrow pronounced it “a work of historical fiction.”

Months later, in Becoming, Michelle Obama explained that the future president “sold his idea for a nonfiction book about race and identity.” No word that David Garrow proclaimed Dreams from My Father a fiction and the author a composite character. Dreams included more than 2,000 words about Frank, but the Communist goes missing in Becoming. And like Garrow, Rhodes, David Axelrod and POTUS 44, Michelle fails to note that, in all his writings from 1958 to 1964, the Kenyan Barack Obama mentions nothing about an American wife and Hawaiian-born son.

Despite Joel Gilbert’s Dreams from My Real Father, and Paul Kengor’s The Communist, also about Davis, few if any in the establishment media were willing to tackle the fakery. As the 2018 midterms approached, the “composite character” of the fictional Dreams from My Father was claiming “the character of our country is on the ballot” and the Republicans are “making stuff up.”

As Sharyl Attkisson showed in her 2014 Stonewalled: My Fight for Truth Against the Forces of Obstruction, Intimidation and Harassment in Obama’s Washington, POTUS 44 referred to people who spoke “Austrian,” and placed Savannah on the Gulf Coast. Despite these and other gaffes, and his many lies, American comedians failed to kindle, intimidated by politically correct prudery. None of that squeamishness for Charles Barkley.

As a player in the NBA, Barkley didn’t care who he dunked on. As a television commentator, he’ll ridicule a “black guy” who pays with a check to have two black guys beat him up and. That same fearless spirit needs to target the fakers of our time, regardless of status.

Journalists, presidential historians and comedians of the world, arise. You have nothing to lose but your chains."

Hello, everyone, and welcome to the latest edition of The 411 Douchebag of the Week. I’m Bryan Kristopowitz.

Is the new Fox show Proven Innocent any good? Not really. It’s actually quite awful. I think the show would be more successful if it was about either Kelsey Grammer’s sleazy Gore Bellows character and his attempt at becoming attorney general of Illinois, or Rachelle Lefevre’s Madeline Scott character (woman sent to prison for a crime she didn’t commit, becomes a lawyer and helps defend the wrongfully accused), just not both at the same time. Grammer is, as usual, terrific being kind of a dick as Bellows, and Lefevre is appealing as an idealistic ex-con turned lawyer. They don’t really work well together in the same space, at least not at the moment.

Now, the show could probably also work, or at least be more interesting, if Grammer’s character led the law firm that Lefevre’s character works for and their backstory is Grammer used to be a big deal prosecutor, he convicted Lefevre, and now they work together to defend the wrongfully accused. Or something like that. I think that kind of show could work. But the show, as it exists now, is just terrible. There’s just way too much time spent on Lefevre’s character trying to come to terms with her past/trying to figure out whatever the hell it is she’s trying to figure out. It’s just not interesting.

Not every new show needs to have an overly complicated, ongoing, overarching story that each episode has to spend a third of its time on because broadcast networks have to compete with cable and streaming and “long form stories are in.” Broadcast should do what it does best: 22 one hour episodes a season and each episode is its own story. What’s wrong with doing that?

And is it me, or does the new NBC show The Enemy Within, based on the commercials NBC runs damn near every hour, look like a reworked The Blacklist?

And now onto this week’s Douchebag of the Week.

This week, the 411 Douchebag of the Week goes to now disgraced actor and singer Jussie Smollett, for apparently staging his own hate crime attack. The Chicago Police finally laid out what it believes actually happened regarding the hate crime perpetrated against the Empire actor. Smollett, who claimed that he was attacked in the middle of the night by two assailants, doused with some sort of chemical substance, and then adorned with a noose around his neck while the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” was actually responsible for the whole thing. In short, the attack was a hoax created by Smollett to somehow get more money from the producers of Empire.

When I first heard about this attack, the story sounded suspicious because there was just too much going on with it. A street beating and a bleach attack and a noose and an attacker yelling “This is MAGA country?” That’s way too complicated. I mean, it’s not impossible that all of those things could have happened, but was it likely? Probably not. There was also the threatening letter part of the story that no one seemed to be talking about. A mysterious threatening letter and then a street beating not that long after letter delivery? Was anyone looking into that? If anyone was, they were keeping their investigation a big secret. Why wasn’t anyone, especially the police, making a bigger deal out of that?

Yeah, this story didn’t seem all that “together.” But, again, stranger things have happened and, who the hell knows, it all could have been true. Maybe. One of those “one-in-a-million” things. I wanted to see what the police knew before coming to any sort of full opinion on the matter. The cops have revealed what they think happened, and it seems way more plausible than Smollett’s story.

Way fucking more plausible.

Now, Smollett continues to claim that he was attacked and that his story is true and he can’t understand why no one believes him. Smollett’s lawyers, after his arrest, have announced that they plan to provide their client with a “vigorous defense,” which, at the moment, looks like it will turn into the Bill Cosby/”It’s all a conspiracy against me!” defense before the end of the week. There’s major controversy over what the $3500 check, paid to two Nigerian brothers who were initially suspects and then released, was for the attack or for a personal trainer/nutrition plan, but that detail doesn’t seem that important in the big scheme of things (I’d also suspect that the Chicago authorities haven’t revealed their entire case against Smollett). It looks more and more like Smollett did this to himself. And that’s disgraceful.

I mean, if he wanted more money, why didn’t he have his agent/representatives negotiate, on his behalf, for more money? If Smollett didn’t think his reps were doing a good enough job, why didn’t he look for better/different reps? Why did Smollett think he could get away with staging a hate crime hoax against himself? Was he unaware that the Chicago Police would investigate the fuck out of his story because he’s a celebrity claiming that he got his ass kicked in their city? How could he be unaware of that?

And now, what do we have as a result of this hoax? Nothing good. Actual hate crime victims are going to have a harder time getting justice because now it will be even harder for people to believe them. And this had to happen because of money?

Money?

Disgraceful.

Jussie Smollett deserves no sympathy. He deserves endless disdain.

Do you think Smollett will eventually have to admit to what he apparently did, or do you think he’ll continue to claim he’s the victim of something, even when he’s in jail?

And, yes, we now have the early front runner for 2019 Douchebag of the Year.

**

And now for this week’s honorable mentions…

–The “Liberal” Media, for not devoting all that much time to the captured white supremacist/Coast Guard member story. You would think that, after Christopher Paul Hasson was arrested by the FBI and his big plans were revealed, that the “liberal” media, one of Hasson’s alleged targets, would have talked a little more about white supremacist terrorists. It didn’t, though. And you would think after it was also revealed that Hanson had modeled his alleged plan after Norwegian white supremacist and mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik and after the Cesar Sayoc mail bomber story last year, there would be more interest in reporting on this shit. Again, didn’t happen. Why? Why was this the third story on the nightly news at best?

I know we’re politically polarized and no one believes anything anymore, but, shit, how many more guys like Hasson are out there? Shouldn’t we know, or at least try to find out?

–Goodloe Sutton, the now former editor of the Democrat-Reporter newspaper in Linden, Alabama, for his “the KKK should night ride again editorial. This story was so insane I didn’t think it was real but, yeah, it’s real. However, the story did have a kind of happy ending in that Sutton no longer runs the newspaper. A black woman runs it now. But, still, Jesus Christ, what the hell is wrong with people? The KKK should go to Washington D.C. and start hanging “socialists and Communists”? Again, what the hell is wrong with people?

-New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, for getting caught up in a prostitution scandal after apparently having a masseuse perform a sex act on him in Florida You’d think a mega rich guy like Kraft would have prostitutes brought to him via henchmen and intermediaries and that he would never find himself in any sort of legal jeopardy because he needs a hand job or to get blown (whatever it is he had done to him it’s apparently on tape). I mean, is this him just being “cheap” (aren’t there high priced hookers for this kind of thing?) and stupid and self-destructive? And, shit, he better hope that this story doesn’t turn into a full-fledged “human trafficking” story because his reputation will be completely destroyed then.

And who else is going to be implicated in this scandal?

–The Internets Outrage Machine, for losing its mind over a John Wayne interview from 1971 where Wayne was revealed to be a kind of homophobic racist asshole. Aren’t there more pressing things in the world to worry about than what John Wayne said in an interview with Playboy Magazine in 1971? I mean, if people want to use this interview as an example of how far we, as a world, still have to go (because there are still way too many people who still think like the Duke did back in 1971), fine. But people were acting like this interview was new news. It isn’t and it hasn’t been news for nearly four decades. The internets can do better than this. Right? Jesus Christ.

Is Donald J. Trump our first Gay President? Ok gang, please lock and clear all weapons. I’m not saying President Trump is homosexual. I’m just bringing up a liberal trope from our recent past and applying it to their current hypocrisy.

Bill Clinton was often (self) referred to as our, “First Black President,” for his alleged support of the Black Community. If today’s leftists had one ounce of honesty and integrity, they would be using a similar appellation regarding Donald Trump; the First Gay President, for his efforts, hugely fruitful efforts in support of the Gay Community. PJ media calls “Donald Trump, [the] Gay Rights Hero,” pointing out that in Trump’s America, Jussie Smollett had a better alternative than perpetrating a fake hate crime.

Jussie might have used his success in the opposite way: to show young black and gay kids that their group identities need not be barriers to achievement. That America, in the year 2019, is bigger and better than that. That playing the victim is a loser move that leads nowhere good. But that’s the old-fashioned approach. In the age of Trump, when the PC armies demand that you buy into the proposition that the orange-haired billionaire’s presence in the White House has unleashed a nationwide tsunami of violence against women, blacks, gays, transsexuals, disabled people, etc., etc., you’d better go along with that party line or else.

The article goes on to point out the irony (I prefer hypocrisy) of the leftists’ position, highlighting the Trump administration’s efforts to eradicate the often lethal persecution of homosexuals.

What’s supremely ironic here is that even as Jussie Smollett was selfishly exploiting – and encouraging – the corrosive notion that Trump’s America is a society awash in homophobia and racism, the Trump administration itself was preparing a concerted effort to fight anti-gay prejudice in those places around the world where it really exists on a lethal level. In 72 countries, being gay is illegal; in eight, it’s a capital offense.

Further down, the article shows that not only do the leftists ignore President Trump’s effort in this regard, they actually ascribe ill intent to them.

It’s bad enough that people who work in the gay-activism racket or for gay “community” institutions show so little interest in working for the rights of gays in non-Western countries. Even worse is that when word came out that the Trump administration was taking on that job, some of these people reacted with outrage.

Here’s the money quote.

In the U.S., of course, it’s the left – the Democrats – that has consistently used gays as pawns over the past decades; offhand, I can’t recall a major instance in which the right has done so. I also know that Trump publicly supported same-sex marriage long before any of the Obamas or Bushes or Clintons did. But let’s set all that aside for now.

Finally—and I’ve added in brackets other minority communities that the leftists have abused in this manner.

Such is the state of gay [Black/Latino/Female] activism in the Western world today. Even as the lockstep soldiers of the gay [Black/Latino/Female]-left establishment (which has never been about helping people, but about using gay [Black/Latino/Female]-rights rhetoric to win gay [Black/Latino/Female] support for Democratic politicians and “progressive” policies) keep promoting the transsexual [Black/Latino/Female]agenda and keep denying that Islam is an existential threat to gays [Black/Latino/Female], the president whom they’ve cast in the role of their #1 enemy is taking on Islamic regimes in an attempt to help gay [Black/Latino/Female]people around the world to whose plight that gay[Black/Latino/Female]-left establishment is indifferent. They call themselves gay activists; but Trump is the real gay[Black/Latino/Female]-rights hero – an objective fact that they’re obliged to deny in order to keep their tiny heads from exploding.

Given President Trump’s achievements, it’s not all that unreasonable that if we apply the Bill Clinton self determined standard, President Trump might indeed just be our first gay [Black/Latino/Female] President. He’s done more for those groups than the last four Presidents, combined—Republican or Democrat.

Catching the mainstream media in a colossal lie is so commonplace in 2019 that attempting to keep them honest seems futile. From Justice Brett Kavanaugh to Ralph Northam to Jussie Smollett, the media are incapable of learning their lesson. They are on a fanatical crusade to propagate their agenda, and nothing — not evidence, not logic, not reason — will stop them. Even when they are caught red-handed in the orchestration of an obvious falsehood, no apologies are issued, no corrections are disseminated. If they can’t fabricate a new angle to support their demonstrably false position, the trail is left cold and a new target is identified. No one is more intimately aware of the media’s blind commitment to the leftist agenda than the students of Covington Catholic in Park Hills, Kentucky.

Most people’s initial exposure to this now infamous controversy was the notorious video depicting Native American activist Nathan Phillips, the angelic martyr incapable of sin, pitted against high school student Nick Sandmann, the demonic white boy responsible for all evil. The video shows Phillips beating a drum in Sandmann’s face and chanting while other Covington Catholic students surround the pair. The video ends with a brief interview of Phillips during which he wipes away well-rehearsed tears while falsely alleging that the students were shouting “build that wall” at him (as is established in this third-party investigative report conducted by a professional investigation firm in which they clear the students of all allegations of offensive conduct).

The media could not have imagined a video more conducive to the proliferation of their anti-Trump narrative. They had an ideal villain — a young, Catholic white male — and the perfect victim — a diminutive-looking, older Native American. The articles alleging racism and bigotry basically wrote themselves. No questions were asked, no context was sought. The media wasted no time in rushing to publish headlines like: “Nathan Phillips, Native American man harassed by high schoolers, tells his story.” They would have had us believe that Phillips was handing out hugs and heart-shaped candies when a group of pitchfork-wielding Catholic boys descended upon the innocent, feeble demonstrator. Nothing could have been further from the truth.

It took merely days for additional footage of the event to emerge. It became quickly apparent that the media’s too-good-to-be-true depiction of the event was just that: too good to be true. The additional footage reveals that it was Phillips who approached the boys, not vice versa. He is shown clearly approaching the group of students, physically invading their circle, and happening upon Sandmann in the middle. There is one person to blame for the conflict, and one person only: Nathan Phillips. He decided to approach the students. He decided to beat his drum in the face of Nick Sandmann. He decided to create a confrontation. No self-respecting person can watch the comprehensive footage and allege that Sandmann is to blame. Moreover, additional information about Phillips was divulged in the aftermath of the conflict. We learned that Phillips lied about being a Vietnam veteran, attempted to disrupt a Catholic mass and has a violent criminal history. Even more infuriating, once the event gained national attention, Phillips decided to play the victim and construct a backwards narrative that he knew the mainstream media would love too much to question.

In the days following the release of the viral video, Phillips — the darling of the media — offered numerous accounts of the event. In one imaginative recount in an interview with the Washington Post, Phillips stated, “It was getting ugly, and I was thinking: I’ve got to find myself an exit out of this situation and finish my song at the Lincoln Memorial. I started going that way, and that guy in the hat stood in my way and we were at an impasse. He just blocked my way and wouldn’t allow me to retreat.” Nathan … you approached them! Moreover, at no point in any of the available footage does Sandmann, or any Covington student, attempt to block Phillips’ path or move in his way. It is painfully obvious that Phillips could have waltzed right out of the group just like he marched his way in. How exactly could Sandmann have better handled the situation? That isn’t a rhetorical question; I pose it seriously. The kid literally stood there and smiled. There is no response that would have been sufficient for Phillips or the media. Sandmann could have thrown himself to the ground and pledged his eternal allegiance to Phillips and the Democratic Party and it wouldn’t have been enough.

The second he put on that shiny red hat, the media decided there was no length to which they wouldn’t go to ensure his demonization. Even if they had to lie through their teeth, promote an account that diametrically opposed the truth and maintain that narrative in the face of damning evidence, they were willing to do it. If the mainstream media’s constant perversion of the truth and blind allegiance to partisan politics doesn’t make them the enemy of the people, then I do not know how to show that to you.

Initially, investigators were focused on finding his attackers, but now their main focus is on whether or not he’s responsible for his own attack. Despite all of the questions and concerns surrounding Jussie Smollett’s situation, the FBI isn’t making any hasty decisions.

According to Complex magazine, Jussie Smollett’s alleged letter is reportedly still under investigation. The FBI has reportedly refused to confirm whether or not Jussie sent the threatening letter to himself. The letter in question was sent to Fox studios in Chicago, Illinois just days prior to his attack on January 29. Since the latest investigative findings suggest Jussie may have been involved in his own attack, there is speculation he may have also sent the letter to himself. However, the speculation has yet to be confirmed.

In fact, the FBI has indicated that they haven’t gotten that far into the investigation. According to TMZ, an unnamed FBI official has reportedly criticized Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson for speaking about the letter during his recent press conference. “I think he [Johnson] went too far. We’re not there yet,” the unnamed official said.

The latest news follows a massive news cycle about Jussie Smollett and the allegedly orchestrated attack. During a press conference last week, Superintendent Johnson made headlines when he publicly criticized Jussie for his actions. At the time, Johnson voiced his frustrations saying Jussie owes “Chicago an apology,” according to the Associated Press.

“I know the racial divide that exists here. I know how hard it’s been for our city and our nation to come together. And I also know the disparities and I know the history,” Johnson said during the press conference. “I love the city of Chicago and the Chicago Police Department, warts and all. But this publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and certainly didn’t deserve.”

Johnson went on to detail the investigative findings posing the question of why Jussie Smollett – an African American man – could make such disturbing false accusations. He also noted how Jussie’s case could make things far more difficult for real victims in the future. Jussie has also been accused of using his celebrity status to further his own agenda.

“Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?” Johnson said. “How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

Jussie Smollett has been charged with filing a false police report in connection with the attack. If convicted, he could face a maximum of three years in jail."

Police say the assault happened Saturday on the Burlington campus.

""UVM is deeply concerned about this sexual assault and grand larceny incident,"" the school said in a statement. ""We are thankful for the prompt police action that resulted in the suspect’s arrest.""

Detectives say Cyphers was known to the victim, and police do not believe that there is any ongoing threat to the community.

Counseling and support services, including a victim's advocate, are available to the victim and any other individuals who may have been affected by the incident, the school said in a statement.

The comedian used his time to take a shot at actor Mel Gibson.

Noah had a small role in “Black Panther” as the ship’s navigation voice. As a result, he appeared at the 2019 show to shower the film with praise. Before showing a brief clip of the film, the star noted what it meant to him and audiences in general. That’s when he managed to take a shot at Gibson, who has been in hot water several times in the past due to racist remarks.

TREVOR NOAH: ‘THE SECOND AMENDMENT WAS NOT MADE FOR BLACK FOLKS’

“‘Black Panther’ may be an African hero, but his story and his appeal are universal. I know this personally because of all the people that constantly come up to me and say, ‘Wakanda Forever!’” Noah said, noting that people in Africa and France come up to him and say the film’s catchphrase. ”Mel Gibson came up to me like, ‘Wakanda Forever.’ He said another word after that, but the Wakanda part was nice.”

TREVOR NOAH: TRUMP'S 'SUPERHUMAN STUPIDITY' LED PRESIDENT TO DISCOUNT HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION'S CLIMATE REPORT

Gibson had been shunned for many years in Hollywood following an alleged anti-Semitic tirade while being arrested for drunk driving in 2006. He was convicted of domestic violence in 2011. The star had another racial tirade leak in 2011 over audio of him and his spouse having an argument over the phone.

Noah, meanwhile, courted controversy in recent weeks over his early jokes about Jussie Smollett after the “Empire” star was found to have allegedly faked a police report of a hate crime attack on him several weeks ago.

Despite a recent turn of events where Smollett was named a suspect in his own alleged attack, he has at least one ally on the Empire set in Terrence Howard.

On Saturday, Terrence Howard made his support known, taking to Instagram to post a video of Jussie Smollett and a baby. He wrote, “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you.”

Sign up to our Celebrity newsletter!

Howard’s comments section quickly filled up, both with those who support Smollett and those who don’t. After one commenter took aim at the Empire star, Terrence Howard responded, again taking up for his castmate.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” Terrence wrote. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Terrence Howard is the first Empire actor to come out publicly in support of Jussie Smollett since he was named as a suspect in the alleged attack against him. There are reports that the cast is split but it’s not known who may be siding against Smollett on set.

Howard’s support also comes just days after learning Smollett will not be seen in the final two episodes of the season in order to finish filming without the distraction. The future of his role as Jamal Lyon on the FOX hit series still remains up in the air.

Jussie Smollett case takes another turn regarding that $3500 check

Public opinion quickly turned on Jussie Smollett after leaks from the Chicago PD claimed evidence that the Empire star may have been involved in planning his own attack.

It was even reported that Smollett may have paid the Osundairo brothers $3500 for staging the attack.

New evidence suggests that was not the case and instead, a memo on the $3500 check coupled with text messages between Jussie and Ola confirm that he was paying for personal training and a meal plan in order to shape up in time for a shirtless music video shoot.

TMZ has even confirmed that the Osundairo brothers have admitted that the payment was for personal training and not to stage an attack on the Empire star."

“Pope Francis’ concluding address” at this month’s Vatican summit on clerical abuse “did not present a detailed, coherent strategy for reform.” So contends Christopher Altieri at The Catholic Herald. He notes that the pontiff’s speech didn’t even address the church’s failures until a dozen paragraphs in. Instead, it cast abuse as “a widespread phenomenon in all cultures.” Fair enough, says Altieri, “but the reason the patriarchs, presidents of bishops’ conferences, religious superiors and curial heads were here is because of the crisis of clerical sexual abuse of minors.” As it is, “one could be forgiven for garnering the impression Francis wants to skip the part where the Church reforms herself.” As for whether the wider summit will produce the “concrete, effective” action the pope called for, that “will come in the follow-through,” says Altieri.

Foreign desk: Trump Steps Back From Disaster in Syria

President Trump last Thursday suddenly changed his Syria policy — “for the better,” suggests The Washington Post’s Josh Rogin. By agreeing to leave at least 200 US troops there, he signaled that “a post-caliphate strategy is emerging to make sure that the Islamic State doesn’t return, that the Turks don’t slaughter the Kurds and that Iran doesn’t take over the entire country.” Credit Sen. Lindsey Graham, who spelled out to Trump the risks if he “cuts and runs from Syria (he would own the disaster) vs. the benefits if he finds a way to get Europe to share the burden (he would avoid the ­disaster).” So the next step “is to go back to European countries and ask them to up their troop commitments.” The ball, says Rogin “is in Europe’s court.”

Conservative: Reparations Are Mere Symbolism

Democratic presidential candidates are battling “not only to out-radical one another” but also to “out-radical Bernie Sanders’ 2016 performance, on the theory that it did not establish the outermost bound of politically potent left-wing radicalism,” notes National Review’s Kevin Williamson. Now Sen. Liz Warren has endorsed paying reparations to African-Americans, a position also held by Sen. Kamala Harris, “but forsworn by other Democrats, ­Barack Obama notable among them.” As evil as slavery was — and its consequences “remain very much with us” — reparations “are the wrong way” to mitigate it. But then, reparations “are not intended to mitigate that evil.” Rather, they are intended to make Warren, Harris or “some other tedious mediocrity” president. And they would “lead to an even uglier and bitterer species of racial politics than the one we already have.”

Political scribe: The Never Trumper’s Dilemma

The “most zealous” Never Trump Republicans, led by former Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, are cooking up various schemes to challenge President Trump in the 2020 GOP primaries, reports The Washington ­Examiner’s Byron York. Already facing an uphill battle, owing to the president’s incumbency advantage, the Never Trumpers now face a new ­dilemma: “A primary challenge could weaken Trump and ensure the election of a Democrat,” at a time when the Democratic Party has lurched to the hard left. This could mean that the “work of Never Trump conservatives ensures the election of a radical candidate on a platform of the Green New Deal, tax rates above 70 percent, universal health care, free college, even more liberal abortion policies and more.” Not that the prospect will deter the Never Trump crowd, “long committed to ‘disposing of’ Trump,’ ” as Kristol has put it.

From the left: Smollett Case and Our Confirmation Bias

The Week’s Joel Mathis says he initially wanted to believe Jussie Smollett, even as he “also suspected he was lying” — because “his story was too perfect.” By which Mathis means “it precisely fit my own expectations of what life is like in America under President Trump, right down to the detail about the attackers reportedly shouting that this is ‘MAGA Country.’ ” Indeed, it seemed to have been “designed in a lab to produce a storm of lefty righteous indignation, and that’s exactly what happened.” Which only shows that “confirmation bias” is real: “We all think we are rational creatures, but the truth is that most of us believe evidence that confirms our beliefs — and filter out contradictory facts,” when “maybe the best thing to do is exercise a little caution.”

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox television series, took to Instagram and posted a video of Smollett holding a giggling baby boy with the message: “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you.”

The post on Saturday came a day after “Empire” producers announced that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season, saying cast and crew were affected and they made the move “to avoid further disruption on the set.”

The series, which is on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. Seven episodes were already completed before Smollett was charged last week with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men attacked him last month in downtown Chicago, hurling slurs and looping a rope around his neck. Investigators say he planned the hoax, soliciting the help of a friend and the friend’s brother, because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett denies the allegations.

Some “Empire” cast members posted supportive messages on social media after Smollett claimed he was attacked. Fox also publicly supported Smollett after the initial claims.

Howard’s post generated more than 385,000 views by midday Sunday and countless comments, both critical and supportive.

In response to one of the critics, Howard wrote: “sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie that I know. The Jussie that I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgement is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone that I’ve called my son for 5 years. It’s God’s job to judge and it is ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There’s nothing more harmful than a fake friend! Real talk.”"

In an Academy Awards-themed tweet, the first son asked his followers to choose from among the so-called nominees, lumping Jussie Smollett, who’s accused of staging his own hate crime attack, with Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before the Senate that then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teens.

The third nominee was Nathan Phillips, the Native American activist involved in a caught-on-camera confrontation with a group of students from Covington Catholic High School Jan. 18.

Phillips said the high schoolers were attacking “four black individuals” before he stepped in, but other videos of the face-off proved he was lying.

Ford said Kavanaugh assaulted her at a house party in 1982. He denied the accusation.

Smollett has been charged for allegedly filing a false police report saying two men attacked him last month while yelling racist and homophobic slurs.

Some Twitter users were outraged by Ford’s inclusion in Trump Jr.’s nominations.

“I can’t believe Twitter allows this kind of harassment,” tweeted @JamesJForbes. “Christine Ford suffered enough and this guy has to call her a lier [sic]!”"

Saint Elmo Brady—the first Black man to receive a doctorate degree in chemistry—had a National Historical Chemical Landmark dedicated to him by the American Chemical Society, the Journal for Blacks in Higher Education reported.

Dr. Saint Elmo Brady, 1st African American to Earn Ph.D. in Chemistry, Honored With a National Historic Chemical Landmark https://t.co/qTCa7791ik pic.twitter.com/F3rlOvPAsk — Good Black News (@goodblacknews) February 18, 2019

The landmark was added to the University of Illinois campus where Brady received his degree 103 years ago, the news outlet writes. Leaders at the American Chemical Society believe it’s crucial that Brady’s journey and contributions to STEM don’t go unsung. The organization’s 2018 President Peter K. Dorhout believes that Brady’s story will serve as inspiration for the next generation of Black STEM leaders.

“This landmark designation recognizes the outstanding accomplishments and leadership impact that Dr. Brady has had on the chemical profession,” said Dorhout in a statement, according to the news outlet. “I am proud to be an alumnus of the university that was part of his legacy — dreaming, designing and executing the creation of four outstanding and impactful chemistry programs that have each worked to ensure access to higher education and the chemical professions for so many young African-American men and women over the last century.” There was a designation ceremony that was held on February 5.

A Louisville native, Dr. Brady received his bachelor’s degree in 1908 from Fisk University. Four years after graduating, he went on to pursue his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois. Throughout his career, he held teaching roles at Tuskegee University, Tougaloo College, Howard University, and Fisk University. He chaired the chemistry departments at his alma mater Fisk and at Howard University as well.

The University of Illinois isn’t the only institution that will receive a plaque dedicated to Dr. Brady. Other universities and colleges that he left a mark on will as well; including Fisk University, Tuskegee University, Howard University, and Tougaloo College.

Smollett was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly faking a hate crime against himself last month. Chicago Police believe he orchestrated the attack to raise his own public profile and perhaps get a raise. The Daily Show been following the story closely, and on Friday, they prepared a trailer for a theatrical version.

The mock trailer featured comedian and Daily Show correspondent Jaboukie Young-White as Smollett. With dramatic piano music playing in the background, the actor complained that $60,000 was not enough for three days' worth of work.

""Maybe you're not as important as you think,"" a man in a suit said.

The movie version of Smollett responded by cutting letters out of a magazine to make a letter reading ""I'm going to kill me."" This did not impress the executive either, however, and soon Smollett was reflecting on his circumstance in the gym with two actors playing the Osundairo brothers, who police claim helped Smollett fake his attack.

The three performed a parody of Smollett's alleged plan, ending with Young-White lying on the ground staring up at the camera and whimpering: ""I'm the gay Tupac."" The final title card read Jussie's Lie.

A few fans groaned at the clip on social media, wondering whether it was ""too soon"" to make light of Smollett's story. However, most agreed that it was a hilarious treatment of one of the strangest celebrity scandals in years.

Meanwhile, Smollett's attorneys are still maintaining his innoncense on his behalf. On Saturday, insiders told TMZ that Smollett's $3,500 check to the Osundairo brothers was for a five week nutrition and work-out program, as noted in the memo.

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,"" Smollett's lawyers said in a statement last week. ""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.""

Smollett has been dropped from the last two episodes of Empire this season as his case moves forward."

According to the latest report by TMZ, Jussie Smollett’s camp has “hard evidence” to contradict the claim by Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson that Smollett paid the brothers that money in a check to stage the alleged attack that’s been the center of media coverage for several weeks now.

According to the report, there are documents that apparently back the claim that the $3,500 check Smollet wrote to abel was for personal training. The check was written on January 23, 2019, which was three days before the allegedly staged attack. The memo line reads, “5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.”

Granted, just because Smollett wrote that in the memo line doesn’t mean the check was not meant as payment for an allegedly staged attack. However, Smollett’s legal team is likely going to present this to create reasonable doubt.

According to the report, the “Don’t Go” reference in the memo line is a song for which Smollett was going to shoot a music video, where he was going to reportedly appear shirtless. Sources close to Smollett claim he was trying to lose about 20 pounds for the shoot, which is why he hired Abel.

The report also notes various texts between the dates of January 20 and January 28 between Jussie and Abel (Bon in the texts). January 28 was a day before the alleged attack. Abel allegedly wrote via text, “I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.”

Other text screenshots show that Jussie Smollett has paid Ola bel Osundairo for “training” in the past using Venmo. Sources connected to Smollett are claiming that the $3,500 payment is meant to be $600 a week for a workout plan for five weeks and $100 a week for a five-week nutrition plan.

As previously reported, Smollett has been removed from the rest of this season’s Empire episodes."

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Eddie Johnson, the department’s superintendent and an African-American man, said he was especially frustrated that another African-American man would lie about having a noose placed around his neck.

I also found this repulsive, particularly given the research and consulting my colleagues and I do at the USC Race and Equity Center. I know from our work how hard it is for people who encounter harassment and assault to come forward: They are placed at risk of being taken less seriously when anyone, let alone a famous person, makes up a highly publicized fake story. If Smollett really did this, that will significantly threaten the credibility of our work.

Lying about an attack could easily weaken the believability of the terrible experiences that people with marginalized identities disclose in surveys and interviews with us.

Our center helps executives in corporations, law firms, colleges and universities and other organizations understand how people across different racial and ethnic groups differently experience those environments. Our work sometimes entails conducting several dozen racially homogeneous focus group interviews over three or four days with people of color and their white counterparts. We also interview women and LGBT people about their encounters with sexism, homophobia and transphobia.

I have heard hundreds of horrifying stories from people who have experienced varying degrees of mistreatment and violence on their campuses and at their jobs. For example, being called the n-word or some other racially derogatory term by a white classmate or co-worker is a disgracefully common experience, one we hear about on just about every campus and at a surprising number of companies.

I do not believe these people were lying. I have no reason to think they made up outrageous stories to shock or entertain me, to garner attention and sympathy or to increase their salaries.

They tell me they want justice and accountability, the dismantling of systems that repeatedly reproduce disadvantage and structural inequities and greater protection for their humanity. They want less violence.

Statistics from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a respected civil rights organization that systematically tracks racial violence in communities across America, show a 30 percent increase in hate crimes over the past four years. Their data also show that white supremacist groups increased by 7 percent in 2018.

There is no evidence that these numbers are inflated. I do not believe most people who report hate crimes are lying. Some do not live to tell the stories of violence they endured. Take, for instance, transgender people, many of whom are killed because of their gender identity and expression.

A report from the Human Rights Campaign shows that transgender women of color are murdered at especially high rates. They certainly do not orchestrate their own deaths. The reality of their vulnerability is undeniable, despite any skepticism that Smollett’s allegedly false claims might engender among people looking for an excuse not to believe victims and survivors.

Shortly after Smollett’s arrest, President Donald Trump mentioned him in a tweet. I fully expect that Trump and others will continue to point to this situation to discredit people who report experiences with racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia. Trump has already shown a pattern of attempting to discredit women who have come forth to report sexual harassment and gender violence. This latest incident will give Trump and others like him ammunition to prove their doubts of future cases are justified.

According to data from the U.S. Department of Justice, only 40 percent of sexual assaults that occurred in 2017 were reported to the police, a 30 percent increase over the prior year. An alarming number of participants in my center’s campus and workplace climate studies disclose that they had not previously reported bad experiences because they feared being accused of lying.

Smollett recklessly put millions of Americans at risk of having their trauma disregarded. It is possible that even fewer victims who survive hate crimes and other acts of violence will feel comfortable coming forward to report these experiences to campus administrators, managers, elected officials and police officers because they will fear disbelief even more.

The risk of being accused of lying is one reason lots of women remain silent about sexual harassment and sexual assault at their jobs.

False reports are infrequent, but when they happen, women’s pursuits of justice and accountability are undermined. Untrue stories also place a more significant burden on people of color and LGBT people to prove that they were attacked or otherwise harmed. This was their reality long before Smollett allegedly lied. He made it worse for them.

One is tempted to ask, What is wrong with these people? What in the world would motivate Acosta to cut a deal with a sexual predator and conceal it from victims? How could Stone be so stupid as to violate a court order, post a picture of the judge next to crosshairs and then take the stand with predictable, disastrous results? Well, arrogance, dishonesty and bad behavior are mainstays of the human condition, sadly.

What is noteworthy in all these is not the brazenness and stupidity of the alleged wrongdoers but the precision of our legal system. If prosecutors such as Acosta misbehave, the law catches up with them. If you try to con the police, as Smollett is alleged to have done, police and prosecutors amass a mound of evidence revealing the actual course of events. If you hire someone to steal an election, there will be a public proceeding, testimony under oath and a reasoned judgment.

This is not to say that the justice system is perfect; it’s certainly not colorblind. However, the system is set up with enough backstops to lead more often than not to punishing wrongdoers while preserving civil liberties for all involved. We have rules both to protect the accused and to let victims be heard, public determinations that press and public can view and - here’s the kicker - judges, police, prosecutors and lawyers who actually are committed to the rule of law. Yes, facts do matter; the letter of the law does count.

And yes, this brings us back to President Donald Trump and cronies such as Stone and Paul Manafort. For them, life’s a show, a con. People, to them, are suckers, ready to have their pockets picked. Trump is convinced that voters are rubes who’ll believe just about anything he tells them. (And why not, after he won the election?) The Sean Hannitys and Tucker Carlsons perpetuate falsehoods, conspiracy theories and divisiveness because they can - and they get paid handsomely. However, lest you despair, even with this administration, the law vindicates facts and criminals get their just deserts.

The show, the con that makes these characters rich doesn’t work when conscientious prosecutors, investigators and lawyers follow the facts and use the process as it was designed to be.

Our frustration may be that our system doesn’t have a legal remedy in all cases; some matters are left to Congress and the political realm. That’s not the fault of the judicial system; it’s an indictment of the sorry state of our nonjudicial branches.

We have all heard about the Jussie Smollett case and the complete 180 that happened, where he became the suspect of a false report and convicted of such charge.

More recently than that, Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, was charged with soliciting prostitution Friday.

These are high-profile people committing crimes, and because of the nature of their names’ status, finding news about both is easy and at the forefront everywhere.

In fact, is is so easy to just look at the bigger names of these cases, and others like them, and stop there to make a final judgment about the scenario.

They are the big names caught doing wrong, so what more is there?

In both cases, there is a lot more for us all to consume and there are very important things that need national discussion.

Starting with the Smollett situation, you need to be caught up if you are not already.

He had accused two people of beating him and yelling homophobic slurs at him.

The police investigation found out he lied and he actually made it up, leading to his conviction for doing so.

But while the major attention is on the fact he was convicted of a crime, a major narrative we still need to discuss is the talk about hate crimes.

Smollett’s intent may not have been to bring up the discussion of hate crimes and racism abroad, but he should not have to.

There are still too many instances of hate crimes that no one seems to worry or talk about, until it happens to a celebrity or on a mass scale.

And this is a narrative that is talked about, on smaller scales about smaller cases, but we as a society need to make sure it is always at the front of national attention.

Whether it is a celebrity or a Muslim man killed in Indiana, which is one of five U.S. states to not have hate crime laws, according to NBC News, it happens and needs to be brought up constantly.

And the same needs to be the case with the deeper background of the Kraft case.

Kraft’s name in the soliciting of prostitutes case in Florida is not the only piece of the puzzle, as there is a bigger ring of sex trafficking that needs to be addressed and known about.

According to USA Today, sex trafficking accounted for 6,081 of the more than 8,500 reported cases of human trafficking in the U.S. in 2017.

So, this problem is not just in Florida and is not being enhanced by big names like Kraft.

Like hate crimes, sex trafficking is a problem everywhere that we need to think about, instead of just reading that a celebrity was a bad boy.

One is tempted to ask, What is wrong with these people? What in the world would motivate Acosta to cut a deal with a sexual predator and conceal it from victims? How could Stone be so stupid as to violate a court order, post a picture of the judge next to crosshairs and then take the stand with predictable, disastrous results? Well, arrogance, dishonesty and bad behavior are mainstays of the human condition, sadly.

What is noteworthy in all these is not the brazenness and stupidity of the alleged wrongdoers but the precision of our legal system. If prosecutors such as Acosta misbehave, the law catches up with them. If you try to con the police, as Smollett is alleged to have done, police and prosecutors amass a mound of evidence revealing the actual course of events. If you hire someone to steal an election, there will be a public proceeding, testimony under oath and a reasoned judgment.

This is not to say that the justice system is perfect; it’s certainly not colorblind. However, the system is set up with enough backstops to lead more often than not to punishing wrongdoers while preserving civil liberties for all involved. We have rules both to protect the accused and to let victims be heard, public determinations that press and public can view and - here’s the kicker - judges, police, prosecutors and lawyers who actually are committed to the rule of law. Yes, facts do matter; the letter of the law does count.

And yes, this brings us back to President Donald Trump and cronies such as Stone and Paul Manafort. For them, life’s a show, a con. People, to them, are suckers, ready to have their pockets picked. Trump is convinced that voters are rubes who’ll believe just about anything he tells them. (And why not, after he won the election?) The Sean Hannitys and Tucker Carlsons perpetuate falsehoods, conspiracy theories and divisiveness because they can - and they get paid handsomely. However, lest you despair, even with this administration, the law vindicates facts and criminals get their just deserts.

The show, the con that makes these characters rich doesn’t work when conscientious prosecutors, investigators and lawyers follow the facts and use the process as it was designed to be.

Our frustration may be that our system doesn’t have a legal remedy in all cases; some matters are left to Congress and the political realm. That’s not the fault of the judicial system; it’s an indictment of the sorry state of our nonjudicial branches.

Eddie Johnson, the department’s superintendent and an African-American man, said he was especially frustrated that another African-American man would lie about having a noose placed around his neck.

I also found this repulsive, particularly given the research and consulting my colleagues and I do at the USC Race and Equity Center. I know from our work how hard it is for people who encounter harassment and assault to come forward: They are placed at risk of being taken less seriously when anyone, let alone a famous person, makes up a highly publicized fake story. If Smollett really did this, that will significantly threaten the credibility of our work.

Lying about an attack could easily weaken the believability of the terrible experiences that people with marginalized identities disclose in surveys and interviews with us.

Our center helps executives in corporations, law firms, colleges and universities and other organizations understand how people across different racial and ethnic groups differently experience those environments. Our work sometimes entails conducting several dozen racially homogeneous focus group interviews over three or four days with people of color and their white counterparts. We also interview women and LGBT people about their encounters with sexism, homophobia and transphobia.

I have heard hundreds of horrifying stories from people who have experienced varying degrees of mistreatment and violence on their campuses and at their jobs. For example, being called the n-word or some other racially derogatory term by a white classmate or co-worker is a disgracefully common experience, one we hear about on just about every campus and at a surprising number of companies.

I do not believe these people were lying. I have no reason to think they made up outrageous stories to shock or entertain me, to garner attention and sympathy or to increase their salaries.

They tell me they want justice and accountability, the dismantling of systems that repeatedly reproduce disadvantage and structural inequities and greater protection for their humanity. They want less violence.

Statistics from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a respected civil rights organization that systematically tracks racial violence in communities across America, show a 30 percent increase in hate crimes over the past four years. Their data also show that white supremacist groups increased by 7 percent in 2018.

There is no evidence that these numbers are inflated. I do not believe most people who report hate crimes are lying. Some do not live to tell the stories of violence they endured. Take, for instance, transgender people, many of whom are killed because of their gender identity and expression.

A report from the Human Rights Campaign shows that transgender women of color are murdered at especially high rates. They certainly do not orchestrate their own deaths. The reality of their vulnerability is undeniable, despite any skepticism that Smollett’s allegedly false claims might engender among people looking for an excuse not to believe victims and survivors.

Shortly after Smollett’s arrest, President Donald Trump mentioned him in a tweet. I fully expect that Trump and others will continue to point to this situation to discredit people who report experiences with racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia. Trump has already shown a pattern of attempting to discredit women who have come forth to report sexual harassment and gender violence. This latest incident will give Trump and others like him ammunition to prove their doubts of future cases are justified.

According to data from the U.S. Department of Justice, only 40 percent of sexual assaults that occurred in 2017 were reported to the police, a 30 percent increase over the prior year. An alarming number of participants in my center’s campus and workplace climate studies disclose that they had not previously reported bad experiences because they feared being accused of lying.

Smollett recklessly put millions of Americans at risk of having their trauma disregarded. It is possible that even fewer victims who survive hate crimes and other acts of violence will feel comfortable coming forward to report these experiences to campus administrators, managers, elected officials and police officers because they will fear disbelief even more.

The risk of being accused of lying is one reason lots of women remain silent about sexual harassment and sexual assault at their jobs.

False reports are infrequent, but when they happen, women’s pursuits of justice and accountability are undermined. Untrue stories also place a more significant burden on people of color and LGBT people to prove that they were attacked or otherwise harmed. This was their reality long before Smollett allegedly lied. He made it worse for them.

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), has heard your cries and she has your back.

The lawmaker issued an apology to Generation Y while speaking Friday at the 22nd Annual Wall Street Project Economic Summit, organized by Rev. Jesse Jackson. As the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, Waters said she sympathized with those struggling to pay the bills, even when you have multiple jobs to help make ends meet.

“What they’re not saying is ‘you haven’t done it enough. It hasn’t worked well for us. We have gone to school. We have graduated. We have done everything that you told us to do only to find we can’t get a job,'” she said. “‘If we get a job it is not worth going to work every day because of the pay that’s offered to us, and we are disappointed at what we thought would be available to us when we come of age, when we graduate and we’re ready to start our careers.'”

“Millennials, I’m sorry about that, but one of the things I talk to the banks about is I want you to create a millennial project. I want you to tell me how you’re going to stop treating millennials the way you’ve treated us traditionally when you looked at our background and our credit records and how many jobs we’ve had and decided whether or not we were stable or not.”

According to The Hill report, Waters intends to call on representatives from the nation’s largest banks testify.

“We’re going to have the CEOs of all the major banks in our committee. We’re going to be asking them some questions, many of them don’t want to come, and many of them think that perhaps we’re going to be too hard on them,” she said. “They don’t really know. All they know is that I’m the new chair and I’ve got the gavel and they’ve got to come, and so when you come, you will find out.”

In related news, Waters has weighed in on the alleged hate crime against her longtime friend Jussie Smollett, who has been charged with falsifying a false police report after claiming two masked men hurled racist and anti-gay slurs at him and looped a rope around his neck late last month in Chicago.

Investigators believe the actor staged the attack as part of a “publicity stunt… to promote his career.” But Auntie Maxine is having a hard time wrapping her head around that.

“I don’t think we can, at this point, make sense of it,” Maxine Waters told Variety‘s Marc Malkin on Thursday at Essence’s Black Women in Hollywood Awards.

“There are still some questions that we have, some answers that have to be given,” the Democrat lawmaker said. “He’s a friend. He was at my office. We marched in the Pride Parade together, he introduced me at ‘Black Girls Rock,’ and so, I believed him, when I heard about it.”

Smollet was arrested Thursday and released after a judge granted a $100,000 bail, and the Empire star paid a $10,000 bond."

Jussie Smollett’s Empire costars haven’t said much about his arrest last week for allegedly perpetrating a hate crime attack hoax. But on Sunday, Terrence Howard came to his defense.

As reported by E! Online, Howard, whose lead character Lucious Lyon is father to Smollett’s Jamal on the Fox drama, posted a video on Instagram of Smollett playing with a baby. “ All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you,” Howard wrote in the caption. And when a follower called Howard out for supporting Smollett—who is accused of orchestrating a much-publicized hate crime attack on himself in an effort to net a bigger salary from Empire’s showrunners —Howard commented back:

@blshealy sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie that I know. That Jussie that I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgement is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for something that I’ve called my son for 5 years. It’s God’s job to judge and it is ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There’s nothing more harmful than a fake friend. Real talk.

Here’s the post:

Though celebrities and Smollett’s Empire colleagues flooded social media with messages of support following word of the January 29 attack, folks have been fairly quiet as the Chicago police release more and more information about the alleged hoax. On Thursday, Tyler Perry posted an Instagram message saying that he had spoken to Smollett and was “lost for words.”

But before the Academy could start handing out trophies for the year’s greatest cinematic achievements, the stars had one last hurdle to overcome: the pre-show red carpet.

And with so much happening in the entertainment world at the moment, it was anyone’s guess which hot-button issues would be brought up in interviews. Anything from the Oscars’ hosting controversy — including the short-lived conspiracy theory that Whoopi Goldberg would be the surprise host — to Jussie Smollett’s ongoing hate-crime scandal were fair game as the stars made their way into Los Angeles’ Dolby Theatre.

As it turns out, neither of those were hot topics of conversation on the carpet, but we still got plenty of ridiculous moments: Regina King’s mom shutting down Ryan Seacrest, Richard E. Grant tricking the reporter into thinking he was having twins with Melissa McCarthy, and Sam Rockwell letting Seacrest rub his freshly shaven head, to name just a few. (Come to think of it, most of these moments involve Seacrest in some sort of awkward situation — so, business as usual.)

Ahead of the main event, The Favourite and Roma led the pack with 10 nominations apiece, while A Star Is Born and Vice placed second with eight nods, and Black Panther held strong in third with seven. And while some categories could be predicted from a mile away, most remained fairly up for grabs.

Several celebrities have weighed in on the Smollett case, including Terrence Howard.

Smollett said the men threw bleach on him, tied a noose around his neck and yelled 'f****t', 'n****r' and 'This is MAGA country!'

However, after three weeks of investigation, Chicago police publicly announced that they believed Smollett made up the attack.

Police added that they believe Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to pretend to attack him because he was upset with his salary on Empire.

According to a Variety report from 2016, Smollett made about $20,000 per episode while co-stars Howard and Taraji P Henson - who plays his mother on the show - each made about $175,000 per episode.

TMZ reported that a check for a total of $3,500 written by Smollett to the two brothers states it was for a 'training fee'.

The memo line on the check reads: '5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don't Go.'

Sources reportedly told TMZ that Smollett paid $600 a week for a five-week workout plan and $100 a week for a five-week nutrition plan, which equals $3,500.

Allegedly, 'Don't Go' is a reference to a song that Smollett was going to appear in a music video for.

Smollett insists he is innocent and his attorneys say they plan to mount 'an aggressive defense'.

'Like any other citizen, Mr Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,' his attorneys said in a statement.

Henry Makow

The border wall, tariffs, Jussie Smollett, elections are distractions from the real issue, Jewish Power posing both as Right and Left, nationalist and globalist, Zionist and Communist.

In 1991, Vladimir Stepin wrote: “The Jews must have, and will have, undivided, absolute power over the whole world. The only point is that the money and the power, but particularly the power, will be achieved soundlessly, without attracting attention, and without occupying the leading roles until the very end.”

This is why resistance — “anti-Semitism” — is banned.

“We have already…possessed the minds of the goy communities…[they are] looking through the spectacles we are setting astride their noses.” (Protocols of Zion, 12)

The Nature of Zionism (1991)

by Vladimir Stepin

(Excerpts by henrymakow.com)

The foundations of Zionism were formulated in ancient times, some three thousand years ago, and they are:

The Jews are God’s chosen people. All other peoples are merely two-legged animals (goys). The Jews have both the right and the obligation to rule the world.

The second and third points of this three-in-one formula actually follow from the first. The formula, which was the brainchild of an undoubtedly talented politician, was among the foundations of the religion of Judaism (see the Book of Deuteronomy in the Old Testament).

At that time people understood very well that if one is to lend force to one’s intentions, one must express them as religious ideas. And one must also strengthen not only the religion but also its influence on people. …

Another point is that the power of this formula lies in that it legitimizes and sanctifies the idea of robbing other nations. Why need we care about two-legged animals? If we are the chosen people and it is our inalienable right, and even our duty, to rule other peoples, then God himself ordered us to grow rich at their expense, as the saying goes.

In this way, nationalism is placed on a material basis. Rob and rule! Rule and rob! Money and power! From the time the above-mentioned formula begins to operate, this becomes both a means and an end, but it nevertheless also becomes a more important means, a means for attaining the main objective contained in the third item of the formula: the Jews must have, and will have, undivided, absolute power over the whole world. The only point is that the money and the power, but particularly the power, will be achieved soundlessly, without attracting attention, and without occupying the leading roles until the very end.

ZIONISTS SET UP CONCENTRATION CAMPS FOR NON-JEWS ACCUSED OF ANTISEMITISM WHICH THEY ORGANIZED

During the civil war in Russia, the Zionists also performed another task. Using some units of the Red Army – Trotsky was the chairman of the country’s Revolutionary Military Council – they organized the Jewish pogrom in Seversk. The result of this was the “Law on Those Involved in Pogroms” of 27 July 1918.

In accordance with this law, a monstrous Zionist terror raged in Russia for ten years: a person accused of antisemitism was, without any argument being allowed, declared to be involved in pogroms and placed against the wall to be shot. Not only anti-Zionists, but the best representatives of the intelligentsia of Russia, could be accused of being antisemitic, and so too could anyone one felt like accusing of it. People saw who was exercising power in Russia and expressed their discontent with it. 90% of the members of the Cheka – the Soviet security organ, 1918-1922 – were Zionists.

Apart from the law on those involved in pogroms, the Zionists practised genocide against the ethnic groups inhabiting Russia, and they did so by accusing people of counter-revolutionary activities, sabotage, and so on, irrespective of whether or not the people in question really had conducted such activities. It was standard practice merely to put them against the wall to be shot.

The major operations conducted by the Zionists included setting up a system of prison camps. Skilfully using as a pretext the interests of discipline and orderliness, Trotsky and Dzershinzky organized the concentration camps in 1918. These were monstrous machinery for exterminating the people of Russia, machinery of oppression and intimidation, machinery of undivided power.

[MAKOW- If I were a betting man, I’d say Zionists put Hitler into power.]

MONEY IS POWER

The Zionists’ money is their most important tool. Money is power – that is a well- known truth.But does everyone know that in the USA, for example, over 70% of the capital belongs to Zionists, and that their capital prevails all over the world? They have been accumulating it for centuries. The gold of all times and nations is amassed in the vaults of their banks. Both in the past and today, the Zionists’ finances have not only served the basic function of finance, namely the principle that money brings more money, but have also been …used to finance one measure or another, to provide loans, to organize conquests, wars and coups, to bribe persons in office, to bribe and finance leaders, groups, parties, to hire armies and bands, to develop trade and industry, to raise matters up or to bring them to destruction – all depending on the tasks being pursued by the Zionists.

In this connection, the corrupting power of money is colossal. A person who has become keen on the idea of accumulating money in order to obtain some benefits or other is already to some extent in the clutches of Zion. By operating with benefits and money, the Zionists can easily make such a person do the things they require: making jobs available, carrying out measures necessary to the Zionists, exerting pressure on unwelcome persons, taking part in financial machinations, and the like. When such a person enters into financial contact with Zion, he quickly understands its strength and bases himself on it. It is not difficult to continue to work on such a person in the spirit required by Zion and turn him into a reliable and obedient tool of Zionism.

FREEMASONRY

Zion has many arms, and one of them is Freemasonry. Freemasonry practically came into being along with Zionism and is its fellow-traveller.

The Freemasons fulfil approximately the same role for Zionism as the Jesuits do for Roman Catholicism. The early Freemasons were the builders of the Temple of Solomon. Large numbers of secret Freemasonic lodges have at all times served as a means of fooling people by promising to build a better world, a world of goodness, charity, equality and justice, but in actual fact as a means of enticing people into the nets of Zion, of placing them under Zion’s command and, through those people, directing countries and events. There is a distinction between Jewish and Gentile Freemasonic lodges and organizations.

The Gentile ones are of course lower in rank, but it is precisely through them that Zion exercises direct control. Influential politicians, public figures, scholars, persons active in literature and art, military men, members of the administrative machinery, and the like, are drawn into the Gentile lodges and organizations, and it is through such people that Zion’s decisions are put into effect.

Freemasonry is strong. But it is still only one of the arms. The head is Zion. Freemasonry must be combated. But the main blow ought to be dealt against Zionism, which controls Freemasonry. At the same time, one should bear in mind that, even without Freemasonry, Zion, by using its own strength, has achieved, is achieving and will achieve its own objectives if it is not stopped.

Note — Leyba Davidovich Trotsky, whose real name was David Bronstein, said: “We must turn Russia into a desert populated by white negroes upon whom we shall impose a tyranny such as the most terrible Eastern despots never dreamt of. The only difference is that this will be a left-wing tyranny, not a right-wing tyranny. It will be a red tyranny and not a white one.”

“We mean the word ‘red’ literally because we shall shed such floods of blood as will make all the human losses suffered in the capitalist wars quake and pale by comparison. The biggest bankers across the ocean will work in the closest possible contact with us. If we win the revolution, we shall establish the power of Zionism upon the wreckage of the revolution’s funeral, and we shall become a power before which the whole world will sink to its knees. We shall show what real power is. By means of terror and bloodbaths, we shall reduce the Russian intelligentsia to a state of complete stupefaction and idiocy and to an animal existence… At the moment, our young men in their leather jackets, who are the sons of watchmakers from Odessa, Orsha, Gomel and Vinnitsa, know how to hate everything Russian! What pleasure they take in physically destroying the Russian intelligentsia – officers, academics and writers!…”

Taraji P. Henson, who plays Cookie Lyon on the hit FOX music drama, was the first to send him well-wishes on Instagram immediately after the reported attack, writing, “We all feel his pain right now.”

Following his arrest last week on charges that he falsified a police report, TMZ noted that several of Smollett’s cast mates want him off the show. But it seems series star Terrence Howard is not one of them.

As the actor who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the series, he has taken to social media to support his television son.

Howard shared a video of a baby sitting on Smollett’s lap and laughing as he tickles him.

“All your lil homies got you. We love the hell outta you,” Howard captioned the video along with a heart emoji.

The court of public opinion is not here for the brotherly love. Many took to the comments to criticize the actor for supporting his co-star. One hater received a lengthy reply from Howard who defended his decision to publicly have Smollett’s back.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” he posted. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Smollett, who plays Howard’s gay son Jamal Lyon on Empire, was arrested Thursday on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for falsely claiming two men hurled racist and anti-gay slurs at him and looped a rope around his neck last month in Chicago.

According to TMZ, Smollett hit up the Empire set following his release and addressed the cast and crew, saying …”I’m sorry I’ve put you all through this and not answered any calls. I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.”

But Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson claims he staged the hoax attack as part of a “publicity stunt…to promote his career.”

“The best thing that Jussie can do is pray and pray a lot,” said Ronn Torossian, founder of 5W Public Relations. “If he made it up, he has big problems in both the court of law and the court of public opinion.”

The “Empire” star claimed he was beaten up on Jan. 29 by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s co-stars and colleagues on “Empire,” celebrities such as Ellen Page and Zendaya, and public figures such as Sen. Kamala Harris rallied behind the actor, releasing statements of support. However, Smollett’s account is now being challenged, with police investigating whether or not he paid two acquaintances, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to stage the attack.

Chicago police confirmed on Tuesday that they received a tip from someone claiming to have seen the three men together in an elevator of Smollett’s apartment building on the evening of the attack. However, later in the day, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that the tip was unfounded.

If Smollett falsified a police report, the charge is a Class 4 felony in Illinois, and carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison. Smollett could also be ordered to pay restitution to compensate for the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation.

“It’s a very, very, very serious situation,” said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor who now works in criminal defense in Chicago. “He’s got some very significant exposure.”

Smollett told police that two men attacked him at 2 a.m., poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. He also claimed they told him that it was “MAGA country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Chicago investigators are now seeking to speak with Smollett.

Federal investigators are also probing a threatening letter that was sent to the “Empire” set. The letter included homophobic language and contained a white powder, which was later determined to be a crushed painkiller tablet. Should that letter turn out to be fake, federal prosecutors could also pursue a mail fraud charge, legal experts say.

Andrew Weisberg, a former prosecutor in the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, said Smollett could get probation, assuming that he has a clean record. Update: NBC News reported Tuesday, and Variety confirmed, that Smollett pleaded no contest in 2007 to three misdemeanor counts stemming from a DUI incident in Los Angeles, including one count of giving false information to the police. According to the criminal complaint filed by the L.A. City Attorney’s office, Smollett gave a false name, pretending to be his brother Jake. He was sentenced to three years of probation.

Weisberg also said prosecutors may face pressure not to be lenient.

“It’s a very high-profile case,” he said. “Prosecutors tend to be tougher because everybody’s watching. … I think they may come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanor.”

Steve Greenberg, a Chicago defense attorney, said prosecutors could also file a charge of obstruction of justice. He said it was likely, though, that Smollett would be allowed to plead to a misdemeanor, and not serve jail time.

“They’re not going to ruin a guy’s life over this,” Greenberg said. “People make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, ‘My car was stolen.’ Ninety percent of the time, even if they’re charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanor.”

Smollett has retained two criminal defense attorneys, Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh. They have denied that Smollett staged the attack, and said he will continue to cooperate.

“His lawyers may be having a psychiatrist examine the guy so they could prepare some kind of psychiatric defense,” Turner said.

Smollett, like celebrity fabulists such as Lance Armstrong and Ryan Lochte, may see endorsement opportunities and roles dry up if he is found to have been untruthful. Public relations experts say he will need to demonstrate that he’s learned a lesson.

“If he made this up, he broke the trust of a lot of his fans,” said Ray Drasnin, founder of Purple Penguin PR. “Say you lied and you’re sorry for that lie. Apologize to the people who have supported you, promise to make it up, and find a cause that’s near and dear to your heart and devote yourself to it.”

Richard Levick, chairman and CEO of LEVICK, said people shouldn’t rush to judgment regarding Smollet and cautioned that there are still, in the words of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, “too many unknown unknowns.” Yet if Smollett did fabricate the attack, Levick says he needs to be more proactive.

“He needs to get ahead of this as much as he can,” he said. “He needs to go see the police. He needs to apologize. He needs to make the announcement about what happened instead of letting the facts leak out. If he lied, there’s no excuse, but there may be some explanation.”

The driver, 20-year-old Dominic Conlogue of Palermo, was listed in critical condition Sunday night at a Lewiston hospital, according to Steve McCausland, spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety.

State troopers said Conlogue’s car went off Mann Road around 9 p.m., hit trees and overturned. Conlogue and his front-seat passenger, 20-year-old Austin Berry of Machias, became pinned inside the car and had to be extricated by China firefighters.

Another passenger, 20-year-old Cole Donald of Palermo, left the crash scene to get help. Berry and Donald were treated for their injuries and released, but Conlogue was flown by Lifeflight helicopter to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston.

State Trooper Connor Willard, who investigated the crash, said speed and alcohol were likely factors in the crash, according to McCausland.

“We knew it was going to be a hard game and we knew we weren’t playing our best game in the first half,” Blanca Millan of Maine said.

In the second half, the Black Bears figured things out defensively.

After surrendering 43 points to the Seawolves in the first half, Maine held Stony Brook to 18 in the second half, pulling away for a 71-61 victory.

Maine, now 20-7 overall and 13-1 in conference play, will close the regular season with games at UMass-Lowell and Binghamton, and can get the top seed in the America East tourney by winning both.

Stony Brook (20-7, 9-5) can clinch the No. 3 seed with a win at Maryland-Baltimore County.

Down 43-41 at the half, the Black Bears took the lead for good at 46-45 on a Millan free throw with 5:53 left in the third quarter. With 3:08 to play in the game, Tanesha Sutton’s 3-pointer pushed the lead to 70-58. The shot gave Sutton 28 points, a career best. She shot 11 of 16 from the field and grabbed 11 rebounds, five offensive.

“My team was looking to get me the ball in the post. It was really just a team effort,” Sutton said.

In the first half, Stony Brook shot 53 percent and led by as many as seven points at 24-17 with 1:54 left in the first quarter.

Maine closed the half with a 5-0 run.

“For us, a lot of times it’s just being focused and locked in on what we want to do,” Maine Coach Amy Vachon said. “They’re really good players. They’re going to make shots, but if we can make them work for those shots …”

Stony Brook made just 8 of 28 shots in the second half. After scoring 21 points in the first half, Shania Johnson, Stony Brook’s quick, 5-foot-1 guard, was held to seven in the second.

Added Vachon: “(Johnson’s) just a really good player. We just tried to make her take hard shots. In the first half, I felt like she was getting open shots, and she’s going to make them.”

Getting Millan more involved with the offense was another key to the second-half turnaround. America East’s leading scorer, Millan had just five points at the half on 2-of-8 shooting. She finished with 18 points, shooting 6 of 10 in the second half while driving to the basket and attacking the rim.

“We just looked for opportunities for (Millan) to drive,” Vachon said. “Driving from the top is a really good spot for her. I think she was more focused on getting to the rim. Her 3 wasn’t going today.”

Point guard Dor Saar had 15 points and four assists, and Fanny Wadling grabbed 16 rebounds for the Black Bears.

“Sutton was having a great first half, as well as Dor Saar. They were kind of going with those two with the hot hand. That’s just the sign of a good team. They have different players who can step up at different times,” Stony Brook Coach Caroline McCoombs said.

This was the Black Bears’ first game at the Augusta Civic Center since 2008. The announced attendance was 1,008.

The Black Bears said they didn’t mind playing a home game 75 miles from their usual home, the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor. A concert scheduled for Sunday night made the Cross Insurance Center unavailable.

“It’s still Maine, so we got a lot of people coming to our game. They were great out there again. It’s different because we love playing at the Cross, but it was still good,” Millan said.

“It was really good to come down an hour away and have fans come and support us – fans who come to every game, and fans that probably can’t because they live here or in Portland,” Sutton said.

“It felt good to play in this environment. The crowd was into it.”
