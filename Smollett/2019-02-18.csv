That woman's name and residences match those of the Pamela Taylor behind the racist post. Taylor defrauded the federal agency of more than $18,000 and could face up to 30 years in prison.

A foldable iPhone? Apple hints yes

Apple's ""bendgate"" controversy last year had everyone stress-testing iPhones, but a new patent filing suggests the tech giant might debut flexible phones – foldable iPhones, that is. Over Valentine's Day, Apple applied for a patent, including 24 drawings that demonstrate ways in which future devices might be bent, such as a pyramid that suggests that two people sitting opposite each other could each view their own screen while competing in a game (Fortnite, anyone?). It's unlikely we'll see a model at the company's showcase in September, but 2020? Apple might be flexible enough to pencil that in.

Real quick

Jussie Smollett's story may be unraveling

""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett claimed he was a victim of a racist, homophobic attack nearly one month ago. He said two masked men assaulted him, doused him in a chemical, yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" and put a rope around his neck. The claim sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, but Smollett's story seems to be unraveling. Police have questions for the actor after two brothers arrested in the assault said they were paid by the actor to orchestrate the attack. Chicago police may shift their investigation to Smollett within the next week as the baffling story drags on.

Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, Abel and Ola Osundairo told cops they got in a car with Jussie and scouted a location, settling on the one right outside the actor’s apartment. The brothers said Jussie chose the spot because he believed a camera would have captured the action. Our sources say the brothers told police Jussie said he wanted to make it a “physical thing,” but not to the point he’d be seriously injured.

Also today, CBS 2 in Chicago is reporting on a possible motive for the attarck. Reporter Charlie DeMar has previously been ahead of the curve on this story and he’s one of three reporters on this story:

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, upset after a racist letter sent to the show’s studio didn’t get a “bigger reaction,” is suspected of paying two men to attack him a week later, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the investigation. “When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards. Other sources corroborated that information… De Mar spoke on the phone exclusively with the Osundairo brothers Monday afternoon. In a joint statement, they said: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

There had previously been a report that Smollett may have been motivated to stage a hate hoax because he was about to be written off of Empire. Writers for the show quickly rebutted that claim last week saying there had never been any talk of removing him from the show. But this new report suggests the motive could be simpler.

The letter containing threats and white powder (which turned out to be aspirin) was sent to the studio where the Empire is filmed on January 22. Here’s what it looked like (alongside a list of items seized from the brother’s apartment):

This is the list of items that were retrieved from the “persons of interest” apartment – notice the “stamps” listed. I wonder if that could be tied back to this (fake) death threat letter #JussieSmollett received? pic.twitter.com/DmnUOYpg8u — Amy (@RightHookUSA) February 16, 2019

CBS 2 notes that one of the things seized in the search of the apartment was a magazine. Another item recovered was unused stamps. So it seems possible police are looking to see if the letters cut out to create the threatening note came from the magazines found in the apartment. It certainly seems like quite a coincidence that the letter contained the same slurs and even appeared to show the rope later put around Smollett’s neck by the two brothers. Finally, the Wrap is reporting today that Smollett has no plans to meet with Chicago PD:

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said. “Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Maybe the cops are waiting to talk with Jussie when they have all their ducks in a row. We’ll have to wait and see what the evidence proves but at the moment it’s not looking good for Smollett."

Smollett, if you’re not aware, is the openly gay actor and singer who is now at the center of a “hate crime” controversy. On Jan. 29, the television star claimed that he had been assaulted by racists who hurled homophobic and racial slurs while trying to lynch him.

The African-American actor went on to insist that it was Trump supporters ranting about “MAGA country” who had attacked him. Quick to use the alleged incident for political points, liberal politicians ranging from Nancy Pelosi to Cory Booker and Kamala Harris all accepted his version of events and used Twitter to promote the narrative that the “lynching” was a consequence of President Donald Trump’s presence in the White House.

Meanwhile, many establishment media outlets ran with that angle as well, basically lecturing the country about how racist and terrible the right was. This headline for GQ, for instance, is an example of one that isn’t aging well.

Then the questions started flying.

Keen observers — or, say, anyone with even a hint of skepticism — pointed out that major parts of the story didn’t add up. On the night that Smollett claimed he was followed and attacked while out and about in Chicago, the weather was so terrible that nearly nobody was outside.

There was also the pesky fact that contrary to a key detail of his story, Chicago is the polar opposite of “MAGA country.”

The idea that Trump-hat-wearing, noose-carrying racists were wandering around a predominantly black, liberal city in the dead of winter looking for trouble struck many as implausible — and the story became even more unlikely after police couldn’t confirm it even after poring over camera footage and other evidence.

Over the weekend, Smollett’s version of the story fell apart. Police confirmed that their investigation had “shifted,” and numerous news sources reported that two Africans from the country of Nigeria had been paid by Smollett himself to stage the attack.

“Smollett paid the two men $3,500 to stage the attack in Streeterville. The brothers, seen on surveillance video near the scene of the alleged attack, told investigators Smollett directed them to buy the rope used in the incident,” reported WBBM-TV CBS in Chicago.

“One of the brothers appeared on (the TV show) ‘Empire’ with Smollett as an extra, and the other was Smollett’s personal trainer,” that outlet continued. “All three men rehearsed their plan just days before everything played out.”

Details about the jaw-dropping events are still emerging, but there’s no dodging the fact that it has been a disastrous few days for the liberal actor’s credibility and reputation.

In a move that certainly looks like desperation, Smollett has now parted ways with his previous attorney and then retained a crisis management team to contain the public relations disaster.

“Late tonight, high powered Chicago defense attorney Michael Monico confirmed to ET that he is now representing Jussie Smollett,” “Entertainment Tonight” producer Brendon Geoffrion wrote on Friday. “Monico most recently represented President Donald Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen.”

But that high-powered attorney didn’t last very long. Just two days later, reporter Rafer Weigel‏ from WFLD Fox in Chicago stated that Monico was out.

He is now represented by Chicago attorneys Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh” — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 17, 2019

It looks very likely that the scandal-stricken actor has shifted to pure damage control.

“Smollett’s management team has retained Anne Kavanagh. Her local firm offers crisis management along with several other services,” Charlie De Mar of WBBM-TV CBS reported.

None of this looks good for the actor or the liberal voices who were all too eager to hitch their reputations to his story before any of the facts came out.

“Hiring a spin doctor isn’t going to help Jussie Smollett regain respect, respectability, sympathy or a job,” pointed out one Twitter user in response to the news about the crisis management firm.

“Hiring a ‘crisis management’ team isn’t going to change facts,” replied another. “Time for Jussie Smollett to do the right thing.”

They’re right. While we must stress that the investigation is still underway and the final verdict is not yet in, it appears all but certain that Smollett has not been completely honest about what actually happened.

Whether this was a blatant hoax or a more complicated situation that spiraled out of control, it’s time for the truth to come out.

Douglas Golden', 'Ryan Foley']",,"['black', 'media', 'hoax', 'americans', 'think', 'trump', 'crime', 'america', 'jussie', 'smollett', 'takeaways', 'democrats']","I don't watch the show ""Empire,"" so I'd never heard of Jussie Smollett before the story broke that he was physically assaulted in an apparent racist, homophobic attack. I suspect most Americans, like myself, thought his story was fishy from the very beginning. Nonetheless, as Americans tend to do, we gave him the benefit of the doubt until more details emerged.

His story seemed so unrealistic and convenient I assumed it would be a day or two before it all blew up in his face. It simply never added up. Trust me, I've been a thug (before Christ), and I've been the victim of a violent crime. If criminals had the time to tie a noose around your neck and shout ""this is MAGA country"" in your face, you'd remember some specific details about their features, clothing, smells, etc.

Stop and think about it. What black man in Chicago, one of the most liberal cities in all of America, is attacked in the middle of the night because he's black or gay?! It would be different if Smollett were robbed for money or gangsters mistook him for someone else. That wasn't the case. Additionally, on the night of the attack, temperatures were well below freezing. Wouldn't Smollett have been bundled up? I wouldn't recognize the guy on the red carpet, let alone during an arctic blizzard! How is an attacker going to recognize and target him specifically because of his skin color and lifestyle?! I'm not Nell Carter, but give me a break!

Democrats like Jussie Smollett shouldn't be able to get away with fabricating stories created to divide Americans and simply walk away with a slap on the wrist. However, since this story no longer serves it's intended to purpose to destroy Trump, I suspect his left-wing media allies will sweep it under the rug as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, here are some useful takeaways from the Jussie Smollett hoax:

1. Political correctness forbade us from calling BS: Face it, although most of us instinctively knew the story was a hoax from the onset, for fear of being labeled racists or homophobes by strangers, we decided to sit back and trust the cops and the media while hoping for the best. The left has us where they want us. Not only have we succumb to self-censorship, but the real bullies portray us as the bullies.

2. The media wanted this story to be true: The mainstream media (MSM) has such disdain for President Trump and his supporters that they were willing to believe Jussie Smollett's lie before the investigation even began. The truth is the MSM is still mad at themselves. Why? The combination of Donald Trump's huge personality and their overwhelming coverage of him during the GOP primary helped him secure the presidential nomination for the GOP. They wanted to run against him because they believed Hillary Clinton would easily defeat him in the general election. She didn't. They want revenge.

3. Democrats wanted this story to be true: No victims, no votes! When you stop to think about it, Democrats don't want racism to end. Their party would be useless if it did. Without victims they won't get votes. If all Americans were financially independent and content with their lives, there'd be no need for the Democratic Party as it exists today. The left constantly stokes fear and anger into the hearts and minds of their voters in hopes that more Americans will depend on them for protection from evil conservatives and for purpose in life. Democrats choose to believe that white, Christian, conservative men are all racists and homophobes. Not because they necessarily believe it, but void of real solutions to the nation's problems, they need a boogeyman to secure their power.

4. Jussie Smollett isn't a good guy: I think ""hate crime"" legislation is stupid! If you're going to charge a person for a crime, charge him or her for the actual crime allegedly committed. It's a safe bet that most violent criminals have malice in their heart. Tacking on additional time to their sentences based on feelings isn't justice; it's juvenile. However, if anyone should be charged with a hate crime, it should be Smollett! This guy could've started race riots! Imagine if black Democrats had begun physically assaulting Trump supporters because they believed Smollett's story. The fact that this didn't happen is indicative of how skeptical the black community was about the allegations. Smollett hates Donald Trump so much he either didn't care or think of the havoc this lie could've wreaked across America. Sick!

5. America isn't the place Democrats say it is: What does it say about America when a gay, rich, black man pretends to be the victim of a racist, homophobic crime? It tells us that such crimes are rare. It also tells us that most Americans are too consumed with their own lives to care about Smollett's race and sexual preference. Americans, in general appreciate diversity. It's Democrats who are intolerant. For God's sake, Smollett had to hire black actors to attack him! Apparently, white racist conservatives were unavailable.

Liberals who live in the social-justice bubbles of Chicago, Los Angeles and New York don't have a clue of what people are like outside of their insulated enclaves. Nor do they care to know. Democrats project their feelings onto conservatives. Jussie Smollett is indicative of what the left has become; dangerous, irrational, hateful, judgmental, close-minded, self-absorbed and phony."

Dancing On Ice viewers were left shocked when Gemma Collins was axed from the show last week, after finding herself in the skate-off once again.

However, it has been claimed ITV producers have been left worried over the competition, after ratings reportedly ‘plummeted’ following the Towie star’s exit.

According to reports, a whopping 6.3million fans tuned in to watch the GC skate for the final time, alongside Matt Evers, with the figure dropping significantly this weekend.

‘This was always producers’ fears — that when Gemma went, interest would wane,’ a source told The Sun, with the publication stating figures have dropped to as low as 3.7million.

‘They’re hoping for some fresh drama to give them another boost.’

Despite ratings being down, the show still peaked with 5.6million people tuning in to watch Jane Danson and Ryan Sidebottom leave the competition, after judges opted to save Melody Thornton.

And it seems that, although she crashed out of the competition, Gem could still land on her feet with a dramatic return to Towie.

‘Gemma’s heart has always been with Towie – it’s where she got her big break and she feels incredibly loyal to the show,’ an insider claimed to The Sun.

‘She’d love to go back – she’s got so many friends in the cast – but it’s all about fitting it into her schedule.

‘She’s constantly busy and if she’s back on Towie, she wants to give it her all. The problem is that Towie is all about the cast’s lives, and her life isn’t normal anymore.

‘She can’t be in the Sugar Hut talking about how she’s working in her shop when her fans know she wasn’t, and instead she was shopping in Harrods with her Dancing On Ice mates,’ they added. ‘But she loves the show, loves the team and wants to return next series.’

It looks like she won’t need to worry about those Harrods trips with her DOI castmates getting in the way anymore…

The actor and musician had also just finished directing an episode of his hit series ""Empire"" and appeared in the EPIX docu-series, ""America Divided.""

""I'm not gonna lie and pretend otherwise, I want this s**t to do well,"" Smollett told Fader last March of his first full album. ""If I didn't, I would just play it for my mother because she f***ing loves it or I would just try and pitch the songs for 'Empire.' But no...these songs really mean something to me and I want people to hear me.""

People are listening to Smollett now as questions mount over his report to police last month that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation have told CNN that Chicago police believe Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the alleged assault.

In a statement from his attorneys issued Saturday, Smollett denied playing a role in the attack.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

The ""Empire"" star told authorities two men who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"" assaulted him on January 29. He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

It's unclear what will happen with Smollett's ""Empire"" character if it is proven that he was involved in planning the attack.

Other television shows have dealt severely with stars caught in controversy.

ABC pulled the plug on the reboot of ""Roseanne"" last year after Roseanne Barr went on a racist rant on Twitter.

The show was later brought back without Barr as ""The Conners.""

That's not to say Fox would cancel ""Empire"" given that it's an ensemble series and not built around Smollett's character.

Vlad Drazdovich, a senior account executive with public relations and crisis management firm Red Banyan , told CNN the situation with Smollett is nuanced.

Smollett's position as a black man who identifies as gay garnered attention to the reported attack, Drazdovich said, but that focus cuts both ways if it's discovered that Smollett lied.

""If his story does turn out to be false, the same people who gave him his platform could end his career,"" Drazdovich said.

Stardom came to the 36-year-old Smollett later in life, but he has been in the industry since he was a child.

One of six children of an African-American mother and white father, he was born in Santa Rosa, California.

Smollett said he initially got into child modeling before trying his hand at movie work.

""It's funny because Spike Lee is here and the first thing I ever did, the first two films we ever did was extra work on [Lee's film] 'Mo' Betta Blues' and 'New Jack City' by Mario Van Peebles,"" Smollett said. ""We moved to LA when I was like seven.""

A young Smollett appeared in the movie ""The Mighty Ducks"" before snagging a role in the TV mini-series ""Queen,"" which starred Halle Berry and aired in 1993.

He and his siblings later starred in a short-lived ABC sitcom about a group of orphaned brothers and sisters called ""On Our Own.""

Smollett's star began to rise more quickly when he landed the role of the middle son of the music industry powerhouse Lyon family on ""Empire.""

Smollett's character, Jamal, was inspired in part by the show's creator, Lee Daniels, who is also a gay man.

A scene from the first season in which Lyon patriarch, Lucious, played by Terrence Howard, throws a young Jamal into a trash can for dressing up in heels was based on Daniels' own experience.

""My earliest memory was walking down the stairs in my mother's heels,"" Daniels told GQ in 2015. ""My dad -- he was a cop -- put me in a trash can. He said, 'You already have it bad, cuz you're black— now you're a f****t, too.' ""

Daniels was one of the first people to offer support for Smollett after he reported the attack.

""You didn't deserve -- nor anybody deserves -- to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you,"" Daniels said in an emotional video he posted on Instagram. ""To be called 'die f****t,' 'n****r' or whatever they said to you. You are better than that.""

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, which produce ""Empire,"" were also quick to support Smollett.

""The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate -- and especially against one of our own,"" the company said in a statement immediately after the reported attack.

""Empire"" showrunner Brett Mahoney told CNN earlier this month that the show had made no adjustments to their storylines in wake of the reported attack.

""I wouldn't stoop to those cowards...in terms of allowing what they did to effect how I'm telling my story,"" Mahoney said.

Smollett was back on set and in production on ""Empire,"" Mahoney said at the time.

"" allowfullscreen>

The series returns with new episodes on March 13.

Smollett is shown in scenes for an upcoming preview, as is his character's father Lucious Lyon standing over a white coffin.

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement regarding Smollett's role on the show after there was speculation that he may have staged the attack to keep from being written off the series.

""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of 'Empire' is patently ridiculous,"" the statement read. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

CNN has reached out to Daniels and the studio for additional comment."

She says, “I think that once the investigation is concluded, then we should all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of that investigation.”

Harris previously tweeted that the alleged attack was “an attempted modern day lynching.”

A spokesperson for the Facebook-owned platform told Breitbart News it was removed “in error” and will be restored.

In a post to Instagram, Donald Trump Jr. called out the social media website for allegedly deleting an earlier post containing a screenshot of a tweet he posted about Jussie Smollett; the Empire actor who recently claimed to be the victim of a hate crime — a claim which is now being disputed.

Trump Jr.’s post included a quote tweet from CBS News revealing that the two men questioned in relation to Smollett’s attack claim that the actor paid them to participate in the attack. Trump Jr. commented on this saying: “Shocked, I really thought MAGA folks (who are all over downtown Chicago) were waiting with a rope/bottle of bleach to ambush a rich guy at 2AM in minus 4 degrees because those are conditions where all people go out for Subway rather than order Seamless. Seemed so real.”

This post was allegedly deleted by Instagram, according to Trump Jr., who attacked the social media service in a follow-up post stating: “Are you kidding me @Instagram? You took down this post??? I mean I got a message you took one down but you wouldn’t even let me see it or give me a real reason so I assume it’s this one or one like it.”

Trump Jr. continued: “I get you want to censor any conservative voices but there is literally nothing in here that wasn’t covered in every news source in the country. It was fine to discuss at length when it seemed to work against MAGA folks but now that it’s apparently a hate crime fraud it’s too sensitive. Why is that? Why don’t you want the truth out there? What if some innocent folks were apprehended because they fit the bill of the BS story? Their lives would have been ruined and you think Jussie would have come out and saved them??? Nah.”

Trump Jr. then accused the social media service of being biased towards conservatives, like the mainstream media and Hollywood: “He was fine creating a hate incident of national prominence and go on TV to back it up, but when called out for obvious flaws it’s too much for you because you like the rest of Hollywood and the MSM wanted it so badly to be true, just like Covington, Russia and so many more. You’re part of the problem. Maybe allow for discourse rather than force feed everyone your leftist bullshit. When you continually trample one side do you expect them to just succumb to it???”

An Instagram spokesperson provided this comment to Breitbart News: “This image was removed in error and has now been restored, we apologize for the mistake.” Breitbart will monitor the platform to ensure Trump Jr.’s post is restored."

The actor and musician had also just finished directing an episode of his hit series “Empire” and appeared in the EPIX docu-series, “America Divided.”

“I’m not gonna lie and pretend otherwise, I want this s**t to do well,” Smollett told Fader last March of his first full album. “If I didn’t, I would just play it for my mother because she f***ing loves it or I would just try and pitch the songs for ‘Empire.’ But no…these songs really mean something to me and I want people to hear me.”

People are listening to Smollett now as questions mount over his report to police last month that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation have told CNN that Chicago police believe Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the alleged assault.

Police sources: New evidence suggests Jussie Smollett orchestrated attack

In a statement from his attorneys issued Saturday, Smollett denied playing a role in the attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The “Empire” star told authorities two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” assaulted him on January 29. He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

Jussie Smollett case: Everything we know so far

It’s unclear what will happen with Smollett’s “Empire” character if it is proven that he was involved in planning the attack.

Other television shows have dealt severely with stars caught in controversy.

ABC pulled the plug on the reboot of “Roseanne” last year after Roseanne Barr went on a racist rant on Twitter.

The show was later brought back without Barr as “The Conners.”

That’s not to say Fox would cancel “Empire” given that it’s an ensemble series and not built around Smollett’s character.

Vlad Drazdovich, a senior account executive with public relations and crisis management firm Red Banyan, told CNN the situation with Smollett is nuanced.

Smollett’s position as a black man who identifies as gay garnered attention to the reported attack, Drazdovich said, but that focus cuts both ways if it’s discovered that Smollett lied.

“If his story does turn out to be false, the same people who gave him his platform could end his career,” Drazdovich said.

Stardom came to the 36-year-old Smollett later in life, but he has been in the industry since he was a child.

One of six children of an African-American mother and white father, he was born in Santa Rosa, California.

According to an interview he gave Good Day New York in 2015, his family moved when Smollett was two years old to his father’s native Queens, New York.

Smollett said he initially got into child modeling before trying his hand at movie work.

“It’s funny because Spike Lee is here and the first thing I ever did, the first two films we ever did was extra work on [Lee’s film] ‘Mo’ Betta Blues’ and ‘New Jack City’ by Mario Van Peebles,” Smollett said. “We moved to LA when I was like seven.”

A young Smollett appeared in the movie “The Mighty Ducks” before snagging a role in the TV mini-series “Queen,” which starred Halle Berry and aired in 1993.

He and his siblings later starred in a short-lived ABC sitcom about a group of orphaned brothers and sisters called “On Our Own.”

Smollett’s star began to rise more quickly when he landed the role of the middle son of the music industry powerhouse Lyon family on “Empire.”

Smollett’s character, Jamal, was inspired in part by the show’s creator, Lee Daniels, who is also a gay man.

A scene from the first season in which Lyon patriarch, Lucious, played by Terrence Howard, throws a young Jamal into a trash can for dressing up in heels was based on Daniels’ own experience.

“My earliest memory was walking down the stairs in my mother’s heels,” Daniels told GQ in 2015. “My dad — he was a cop — put me in a trash can. He said, ‘You already have it bad, cuz you’re black— now you’re a f****t, too.’ “

Daniels was one of the first people to offer support for Smollett after he reported the attack.

“You didn’t deserve — nor anybody deserves — to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you,” Daniels said in an emotional video he posted on Instagram. “To be called ‘die f****t,’ ‘n****r’ or whatever they said to you. You are better than that.”

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, which produce “Empire,” were also quick to support Smollett.

“The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own,” the company said in a statement immediately after the reported attack.

“Empire” showrunner Brett Mahoney told CNN earlier this month that the show had made no adjustments to their storylines in wake of the reported attack.

“I wouldn’t stoop to those cowards…in terms of allowing what they did to effect how I’m telling my story,” Mahoney said.

Smollett was back on set and in production on “Empire,” Mahoney said at the time.

The series returns with new episodes on March 13.

Smollett is shown in scenes for an upcoming preview, as is his character’s father Lucious Lyon standing over a white coffin.

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement regarding Smollett’s role on the show after there was speculation that he may have staged the attack to keep from being written off the series.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” the statement read. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

CNN has reached out to Daniels and the studio for additional comment."

According to reports over the weekend, Chicago police now believe that Empire actor Jussie Smollett orchestrated an attack on himself by paying two men to beat him.

Smollett previously claimed that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in downtown Chicago in January. The “attackers” also allegedly shouted “This is MAGA country!” during the attack.

When the news originally broke of the alleged attack, many Hollywood celebrities used it to cast blame on President Trump and his supporters.

“Heartbroken and furious reading about the attack on JussieSmollett. I want Trump and all MAGA lunatics to burn in Hell,” actor Billy Eichner said last month.

Milano used her social media presence to attack a group of teenagers from Covington Catholic High School during another media-fueled racism controversy.

“The red MAGA hat is the new white hood,” she said. “Without white boys being able to empathize with other people, humanity will continue to destroy itself.”

The activist later doubled down on that claim, stating in an op-ed that “everyone who proudly wears the red hat identifies with an ideology of white supremacy and misogyny.”

More recently, the 46-year-old has been using her voice to grace the world with deep thoughts like that she has no equality in America because of her genitalia.

“My name is Alyssa Milano, and in 2019 I do not have equal rights in the Constitution,” the Sundays at Tiffany’s star said during a protest in Washington, D.C. in January.

“That’s right, because I have a vagina I do not have equality and justice.”"

Smollett has repeatedly denied staging the attack, according to statements from his attorneys.

The two men, Nigerian brothers, Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo were arrested on Wednesday but released without charge on Friday as police say they’ve found “new evidence”.

The Osundairos, who are acquaintances with Jussie, are said to be cooperating fully with police. They reportedly told police that Jussie orchestrated the attack and they rehearsed it days before the incident took place.

Sources told CNN there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at a hardware store in Chicago.

CBS, quoting other sources, said Jussie, was upset after a racist letter sent to Empire’s studio didn’t get a “bigger reaction.”

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards. CBS said Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 for the attack.

TMZ, quoting law enforcement sources, reports that the Osundairos “told cops they got in a car with Jussie and scouted a location, settling on the one right outside the actor’s apartment. The brothers said Jussie chose the spot because he believed a camera would have captured the action.”

CBS’ Charlie De Mar spoke on the phone exclusively with the Osundairo brothers on Monday afternoon. In a joint statement, they said: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Their attorney, Gloria Schmidt said: “In due course all the facts will reveal themselves, and at the end of the day, my clients are honest and credible.”

DailyMail reports that in the hours before the attack, Jussie was in New York City for a day of readings for a possible revival of “Take Me Out.”

Take Me Out, a Tony-winning production follows a biracial baseball player who is attacked by a pitcher — and called a “n—-r” and “f—-t” — after coming out.

However, Smollett is “angered and devastated” at suggestions he was involved in his attack as brothers are questioned by police were paid $3,500 to stage the attack.

The men who were arrested in connection with the attack on Jussie Smollett are Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo.

The brothers were arrested Wednesday but released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of “new evidence.”

In a joint statement issued to WBBM – TV, the men said: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh, and Victor P. Henderson issued a statement to CNN Saturday night saying Smollett was angry about these latest developments.

Here is the full statement:

As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. See Also Entertainment Brad Pitt and Charlize Theron Are Still in the Friend Zone Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to “unnamed” sources inside of the investigation but will continue discussions through official channels.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Anthony Guglielmi, the Police Department’s chief spokesman, reiterated the detectives’ desire to talk to Smollett about the case. Guglielmi said he hopes there’s a “mutually beneficial time” that can be worked out between the detectives and Smollett’s lawyers to make that happen.

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” Smollett spokeswoman Anne Kavanagh said in an emailed statement Monday. “Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.

The Daily Caller News Foundation contacted the Chicago Police Department Monday to confirm if Smollett’s case was headed to a grand jury.

“We do not have that information at this point,” Jennifer Bryk of CPD said to The Daily Caller News Foundation over email.

Rafer Weigel of Fox 32 tweeted Monday that CPD said Smollett’s case could go to a grand jury if the “Empire” actor does not “voluntarily come in for questioning.”

Smollett reported he was attacked, doused with an unknown chemical substance, had a rope tied around his neck and two men who yelled, “This is MAGA [Make America Great Again] country” at him on Jan. 29.

There have been reports, however, that the attack was staged by Smollett and the two brothers were allegedly paid to help, according to CNN.

Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement Sunday saying such claims were “nothing further from the truth.”

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement Sunday to The Daily Caller News Foundation. “We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Jussie Smollett allegedly orchestrated his January 29 Chicago attack because a racist, homophobic letter addressed to him on January 22 didn’t get a “bigger reaction,” according to sources.

Via TheGrapeJuice.net, a note addressed to the Empire star was mailed to Cinespace Studios, where the Fox show is filmed. The letter — containing a white substance later determined to be aspirin — contained a racist and homophobic message (pieced together from magazine images), as well as a picture of a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing toward it.

Per CBS 2 on Monday, a source told investigator Brad Edwards that the thespian “concocted the staged attack” after the letter “didn’t get enough attention.” Other sources corroborated this information.

Additionally, on Monday afternoon, fellow investigator Charlie De Mar spoke with brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, who, per reports, were allegedly paid by Smollett to orchestrate the attack.

In a joint statement, the two said on the phone:

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Last week, when the Chicago Police Department searched the Osundairo brothers’ home, they reportedly found a magazine, a book of stamps, and a “piece of paper/writing.”

The Nigerian brothers’ attorney Gloria Schmidt said in a statement:

“In due course all the facts will reveal themselves, and at the end of the day, my clients are honest and credible.”

As we reported, the latest accusations against Smollett include the claim that he and the brothers allegedly rehearsed the attack days before the incident by scouting a location in front of the actor’s apartment.

Though their investigation has “shifted,” the Chicago PD have not officially declared Smollett a suspect.

The message was also retweeted by the Empire writers room Twitter page.

Smollett claims he was attacked by two men in the early hours of Jan. 29 when he was walking to his Chicago apartment. The 36-year-old claims the men were wearing red ""Make America Great Again"" hats and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. He also claimed the men poured an unknown chemical on him and put a rope around his neck.

Throughout last week, rumors the attack may have been a hoax surfaced, and two brothers—Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo—were arrested Friday. Hours later, they were released without being charged. Police said they provided ""new evidence.""

Law enforcement sources told local news outlets the brothers told detectives Smollett paid them $3,500 to participate in the attack before they went to Nigeria the day of the alleged incident and were promised $500 when they returned to Chicago. They reportedly said they rehearsed the attack ""days"" before it happened and bought the rope found around Smollett's neck.

After the details of the evidence surfaced in the media, Smollett's attorneys issued a statement, saying the actor did not play a ""role in his own attack.""

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read.

Meanwhile, TMZ is reporting that the Smollett case was set to go before a grand jury Tuesday, but it could be delayed for ""several days"" because police want to have all the records necessary for the jurors if they chose to indict Smollett for allegedly lying on a police report. TMZ's sources said the Osundairo brothers will appear voluntarily to testify.

There were rumors last week Smollett was going to be written off Empire, but Fox denied this.

Our long-held belief – reiterated often over the years – is that “crime is crime,” and that “some level of hate (is) necessary for the commission of any crime.” To read our most extensive treatment of the subject, check out this post – written in the aftermath of last October’s deadly shooting at the Tree of Life/ Or L’Simcha synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

At the conclusion of that post, we argued that if our society was serious about cracking down on violence and murder it would focus on “reinstating capital punishment (and significantly enhancing its deterrent capabilities)” rather than “conjuring up new politically correct charges that will ultimately have no bearing whatsoever on the consequences” faced by alleged hate crime perpetrators.

But what about fake hate crimes? What should we do about them? And what should we do about the fact we live in a country where the market for divisiveness is so great there are people who will fabricate such crimes for mainstream media consumption.

Among them (allegedly)? Jussie Smollett, a 36-year-old actor/ singer from Santa Rosa, California.

According to CBS Chicago, Smollett “is suspected of paying two men to attack him” as part of a staged hate crime on the streets of Chicago on January 29. Smollett originally told police he was jumped in the Streeterville neighborhood on Chicago’s north side by two white men wearing ski masks. According to him, these two men beat him up and assailed him during the attack with racial and homophobic slurs (Smollett is gay). They also allegedly wrapped a noose around his neck and poured an “unknown liquid” on him.

The incident was immediately seized upon by Democratic presidential candidates, including U.S. senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris. Booker referred to the incident as a “modern-day lynching,” while Harris called it an “attempted modern day lynching.”

The narrative has turned, though. Now, Smollett is accused of paying two Nigerian brothers – both of whom have appeared as extras on his Empire television program – $3,500 to attack him. According to the CBS Chicago report, Smollett was motivated to stage the attack after the media failed to pay sufficient attention to a fake racist letter sent to Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, where Empire is filmed.

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” an investigator told the station.

Wow …

Even more damning, Smollett was reportedly willing to pursue criminal charges against his “assailants” – until he learned police had detained his alleged co-conspirators. At which point he is said to have declined to press charges.

Weak …

[su_dominion_video_scb]

In the aftermath of the allegations against Smollett, reporter Andy Ngo posted a lengthy thread of hate crime hoaxes – most of which were never exposed for what they were by the mainstream press. He also wrote a thoughtful commentary on the underlying issue.

“Jussie Smollett’s hoax is symptomatic of America’s illness,” Ngo wrote in his piece for National Review. “Because of the mainstreaming of academia’s victimhood culture, we are now in a place where we place more value on being a victim than on being heroic, charitable, or even kind. Victims or victim groups high on intersectionality points are supposed to be coveted, treated with child gloves, and believed unreservedly. Their ‘lived experience’ gives them infinite wisdom. Those who urge caution are treated as bigots.”

That is the certainly playbook of the far left …

Conservative writer Matt Walsh boiled it down further.

“We have elevated victimhood to a desirable status,” he wrote for Daily Wire. “Our children are raised to crave it, envy it, seek it. The great paradox of modern American culture is this: victimhood equals power.”

Again, we cannot get too worked up over fake hate crimes because we refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of the “authentic” genre.

Like we said, crime is crime. If you deprive someone of life, liberty or property then you should face the consequences for your illegal actions … irrespective of what motivated you to take those illegal actions in the first place.

But Smollett’s saga is certainly a cautionary tale for those looking to unfairly demonize those who disagree with them.

And Democrats are wielding the instrument of our destruction. Jussie Smollett an actor on the show Empire, claimed that while walking Chicago’s streets in the early hours of the morning, he was attacked. He claims he was doused with bleach and had a noose tied around his neck. And that his attackers called Chicago “MAGA Country.”

That statement should have given any thinking person reason to pause. Of all the places that are not MAGA country, Chicago is one.

That aside.

Socialist Democrats tearing apart the very fabric of what makes America great

It was the perfect crime to vilify the conservative right. It melded race, homophobia, and politics into a quick docu-drama style story. Perfect for a liberal son of Hollywood.





Chicago Police may no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim. However, there is a victim in this latest theater of ideology. It’s us. All of us. Our way of life. Constitution. Our ability to see and believe in the truths that are put before us.

And it harms young liberals eagerly drinking the kool-aid of ideological diversity being distributed by the Democrat party.

For the Socialist Democrat ideologues like Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Corey Booker (D-NJ) this was the perfect crime to enrage social politics. A young, attractive, gay black man being attacked by two men wearing hoods and MAGA hats. He claims to have been doused with bleach to lighten his skin and a “noose” was placed around his neck.

The perfect crime to show that radical right-wing extremists were attacking the good Socialist Democrats among them.

Some obvious issues in Smollett’s story:

As previously stated this is Chicago, a liberal stronghold for, well, forever.

If you ask a Socialist Democrat, no black would align with Donald Trump. Those that do are paid, coerced or looking for a spotlight. The truth is President Trump has a large, growing following among the African-American and black communities.

Smollett did not immediately report the crime or use the cell phone in his pocket to call the police, claiming embarrassment. None of the Hollywood ilk would bypass the chance to be dramatically on-camera as the police respond to his cries for help.

Proof of our national hysteria over President Trump

Within moments of President Trump’s election, liberals began experiencing a national hysteria. A mental meltdown that started with those that believed that Hillary Clinton had some right to the Presidency.





National hysteria has crept into our political bodies and our cities.

Early Anti-Trump cheerleaders like Maxine Waters and Elizabeth Warren immediately began crying for the President’s impeachment and the harassment of conservatives and members of the Trump Administration. Water’s encouraged violence and in-your-face activism to disrupt not the political lives, but the personal lives, of conservatives and conservative politicians.

The FBI and DOJ, with help from the Clinton Cabal, Republican John McCain, GPS-Fusion and Christopher Steele, became weaponized in their attacks against conservatives and the President. Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is turning into the cotter pin of the coup détat against the President. That formal actions, starting with the Russia dossier and false allegations against the president, has led to a multi-year national investigation. Or a nightmare.

Either way, the actions of the weaponized justice system have nothing to do with justice as much as revenge. Revenge against the man who finally shut Hillary Clinton down.

Senate Intelligence Commission finds no Russian Collusion and neither will Robert Mueller

The Senate Intelligence Committee is ending its multi-year investigation into possible meddling by the Russian’s in the 2016 election. Democrats and Republicans on the committee say they have found no evidence to connect the Trump campaign in a conspiracy with Russia.

Unfortunately, the hysteria surrounding President Trump has led to the harassment and indictment of General Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort. At this time Roger Stone and Jerome Corsi are both under investigation. To the weaponized end of the Justice System and the never Trump deep-state cabal, the destruction of Americans is but collateral damage.

Remembering Liberal Lies about Benghazi

Like when Clinton and Obama let four Americans Ambassador Chris Stevens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and two CIA operatives, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both former Navy SEALs were left to die in the 2012 Benghazi attack. Clinton attempting to cover-up CIA activities and the results of her actions in Libya felt they were but collateral damage. Because their activities were illegal, immoral and caused the death of four Patriots.

Further damaging the Benghazi Four’s sacrifices by claiming a “video” created the outrage that led to the deaths. Lies. Lies on lies. However, for the Socialist Democrat party, lies are justified if they create the desired results. Because hey, we all deserve a participation trophy. Even when we lose the game for the team.

Jussie Smollett – taking one for the cause?

The alleged attackers are actors seeking a break into Hollywood. One acting as a physical trainer for Smollett. We may never know what Smollett was thinking during this attack. Or if he orchestrated the attack. But the Chicago Police say Smollett is no longer a victim. The men briefly detained are no longer suspects, claiming Smollett paid them for their participation.

Reports are that evidence shows that the attack was most likely pre-planned and rehearsed. It appears the attack was the actor’s attempt at writing a drama.

What is most interesting from this tale whose veracity required immediate questioning, is the rush to judgment.

Smollett’s attack is happening for a reason, says Representative Maxine Waters. Claiming that at fault is President Donald Trump. Possibly Ms. Water’s should consider that it is her, and her party followers, like Hollywood’s Mr. Smollett, that is creating the division, the hate and the social horror.

Speaking as a conservative living in a Sanctuary State, there is no pro-Trump, pro-life messages on my car or home. My neighbors, the ones with the resist flags and impeach signs would at best remove them, at worse vandalize my personal property.

Why do I believe that? Watch Max at work. Note Jussie standing up for social justice while trashing the President and conservatives, like me.

Corey Booker claims that since 9/11, the marjority of attacks on U.S. soil have been from right wing extremists.

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe. To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention. https://t.co/EwXFxl5f2m — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) January 29, 2019

Presidential hopeful Senator Kamila Harris joining Mr. Booker in calling the attack a modern-day lynching.

Nonetheless, Mr. Booker, facts are funny things:

Here is a timeline of major terror attacks in the US (America since 9/11: timeline of attacks linked to the ‘war on terror’):

4 July 2002

Hesham Muhammad Hadayet, an Egyptian national with a green card giving him permanent status in the United States, killed two people and wounded four at an El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport. The FBI later concluded that it was an act of terrorism but that Hadayet was acting alone.

1 June 2009

In 2009, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, an American-born convert to Islam, opened fire on an army recruiting office in Little Rock, Arkansas. Muhammad killed one soldier and wounded another. His lawyers produced an expert who testified that he was delusional and Muhammad eventually pled guilty to avoid the death penalty.

5 November 2009

Army Major Nidal Hasan opened fire in the Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, Texas. The American-born Hasan killed 13 fellow soldiers and wounded 32. At his trial, he declared himself to be at war with America and investigators found that although he acted alone, he had accessed jihadist websites. Hasan was sentenced to death.

15 April 2013

The Boston Marathon bombing attack was carried out by two brothers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The bomb placed at the finish line of the Boston Marathon killed three people and injured 264. The two later killed Sean Collins, an MIT police officer. In addition, in a firefight between the brothers and the police, 16 officers were injured and another later died. Tamerlan, the older brother, died after he was shot by police and his brother ran over him in an attempt to escape. Dzhokhar was apprehended and sentenced to death. The two Kyrgyz-American immigrants had been self-radicalized but learned to make their bomb from the al-Qaida online magazine Inspire.

16 July 2015

Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez attacked both a marine recruiting office and US Navy reserve center. Abdulazeez first opened fire on the recruiting office from a car, wounding a recruiter inside. He then drove to a Navy reserve center where he killed four marines and one seaman before police officers killed him. Abdulazeez was an American citizen born in Kuwait.

15 December 2015

A married couple, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tasheen Malik, opened fire on a Christmas party at the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, where Farook worked. Fourteen people died and 24 were injured. Farook was born in the United States and Malik was a Pakistani immigrant who married Farook in Saudi Arabia after they met on the internet. The FBI later described the two as “homegrown violent extremists” and found that they had radicalized before they met online.

12 June 2016

American-born Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 58 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. In calls made during his rampage at the gay nightclub, Mateen pledged allegiance to Isis. After his initial assault, the attack into a hostage situation that lasted for nearly three hours.

31 October 2017

A man drove a rented pickup truck into cyclists and runners on the Hudson River bike path on Manhattan’s lower west side, killing eight people and injuring 11. Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old immigrant from Uzbekistan, has been charged with murder. On 28 November 2017, he pleaded not guilty. The next hearing in Saipov’s case is set for 23 January.

Not a right-wing extremist among the group.

What about domestic terror, Mr. Booker?

Las Vegas Route 91 Harvest Festival killed 851.

There is no evidence that the shooter, Stephen Paddock, was a right-wing extremist. Instead, it seems that ballooning debt, not politics, is more responsible. Note, the people Paddock killed were there for a Country and Western music concert, a group that statistically leans toward conservatism.

Stoneman Douglas High School Shooting in 2018.

Seventeen, mostly children, were killed by Nikolas Cruz. Despite the Broward County sheriff’s office receiving a number of tips in 2016 and 2017 about Cruz’s threats to carry out a school shooting, no significant actions were taken. Cruz, who had expressed violent thoughts toward many groups, including blacks, gays, Mexicans, was allowed to slip through the cracks of democrat policies.

Pittsburg Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in 2018.

The eleven congregants killed by Gregory Bowers were members of the Conservative Jewish Synagogue. Bowers was a known and vocal anti-semite, but no evidence he was a right-wing extremist.

Sutherland Springs Church Shooting in 2017.

This shooting was the result of a domestic dispute. Devin Patrick Kelley entered the church, conducting the fifth-deadliest shooting in the U.S. Kelly was supposed to be prohibited to purchase firearms due to multiple previous domestic violence convictions, rape and assault on a child charges. Kelley was also separated from the Air-Force following a military court-martial. However, Kelly had a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns.

As Kelley left the church, he was confronted by and traded fire with Stephen Willeford, a local resident and former NRA firearms instructor. Williford, armed with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle shot Kelley twice, once in the leg and in the upper left torso under his tactical gear. As Kelley escaped Williford persued him in a high speed chase that ended in Kelly hitting a tree after shooting himself.

Liberals and liars

One only has to look at the good Reverand Al Sharpton to find one of the earliest instances of liberals lying about crimes for political gain. (Revisiting a Rape Scandal That Would Have Been Monstrous if True). In the late 1980’s Tawana Brawley claims were she was abducted and repeatedly raped by six white men. When found the initials “KKK” were written across her chest. There is a racial epithet on her stomach. There was feces in her hair.

Reports at the time were that she was traumatized to the point of being mute. Only being able to communicate via blinking her eyes to yes or no questions.

Brawley would claim that two of the rapists were law enforcement officials.

Ms. Brawley’s case went to the grand jury where after seven months, 6,000 pages of testimony and 180 witnesses, her story was found to be a hoax. Neither the police officer nor the district attorney accused by Ms. Brawley and Mr. Sharpton had been involved in any way.

Brawley and Sharpton never apologized for their role in the hoax. Neither will Waters, Harris, Booker or Smollett.

Correction: References that two of the alleged attackers are Nigeran removed."

Some are already walking back their initial support of the Empire actor, while still taking a wait and see approach. But an unexpected name joined their ranks this week. None other than Al Sharpton has taken the plunge, saying that if this was a hoax, Smollett should be held accountable “to the maximum.” (NY Post)

The Rev. Al Sharpton believes Jussie Smollett should face “accountability to the maximum” – if it’s found that he made up the hate attack against him… “I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,” Sharpton said Sunday night on his show “PoliticsNation” on MSNBC. “I still maintain that,” he continued. “And if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.”

Look, it’s good to see people being a bit more realistic about what looked like an awfully fishy story to begin with, but the Reverend Al Sharpton? Is this really the sort of issue he should be weighing in on? You may recall Sharpton’s involvement in the Tawana Brawley hoax back in the day. Sharpton never truly owned up to that fiasco, though he was ordered to pay Dutchess County prosecutor Steven Pagones $65,000 in a subsequent defamation suit. (Sharpton did eventually pay the money, though Brawley herself only ever made token payments on her much larger portion of the settlement.)

Al Sharpton has made a fine living as a race-baiter and hustler, dodging the IRS and using his National Action Network as a protection racket. (NAN regularly threatened companies with boycotts and protests, accusing them of racism if they didn’t donate to the organization.)

The point is, Sharpton isn’t exactly somebody who should be throwing stones at Jussie Smollett given the vast glass mansion he lives in. What Smollett has allegedly done is bad, but it’s nowhere near the level of the Tawana Brawley hoax. Perhaps the Reverand Al should sit this one out."

A new report by multiple sources say that Chicago police now believe that Smollett paid brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo $3,500 to participate in a fake attack against him.

This is seriously bad news for Smollett, as faking a violent attack might end up landing him to up to 3 years in prison for his false police report.

From The Conservative Tribune: Considering the amount of attention Smollett’s original report received from liberal celebrities and top Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a candidate for the Democratic nomination, the latest development could be more than a little embarrassing for the country’s liberal political and entertainment establishment.

The men, identified by ABC News as brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, were arrested on Wednesday as persons of interest in the investigation into Smollett’s claim that he had been attacked on Jan. 29.

The Osundairos were released 48 hours later without being charged, due to Chicago law enforcement’s discovery of “new evidence,” CNN reported.

ABC News reported that Chicago police said they were “eager to speak to Jussie Smollett” after they released the Osundairos.

According to CBS News Chicago sources, the brothers told detectives that Smollett rehearsed the attack with them in the days leading up to Jan. 29.

Smollett reportedly told the Osundairos which items he wanted used in the assault and even paid for the rope used during the incident.

Smollett is reported to have paid the brothers $3,500 before they left for Nigeria later the same day of the incident. Smollett also promised them $500 more when they returned to the U.S, CBS reports.

Since the Osundairos were released from police custody they have been staying in an undisclosed location and are cooperating with the police, according to CBS.

The brothers’ information has changed the focus of the investigation, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement on Saturday.

Case Update: Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete. pic.twitter.com/Hswn1Qjgcy — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 16, 2019

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” Guglielmi said, as reported by CBS.

Police raided the Osundairos’ home on Wednesday, the same day the brothers were arrested after returning from Nigeria.

CBS reported that the police seized a seized a black face mask hat, an “Empire” script, phone receipts, and bleach from the brothers’ home.

On Jan. 29, Smollett reported to police that he had been attacked near his apartment in Chicago. His two attackers allegedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him before they put a rope around his neck and poured a chemical on him.

ABC reported that police say that the Osundairos “have a relationship” with Smollett. Deadline reported that at least one of the Osundairos seems to have already known Smollett and worked with him on “Empire.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said in a statement to ABC on Saturday night that their client is angry over doubts about the legitimacy of the attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement reads.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Smollett has previously expressed his anger over those who doubt his claims.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black (who attacked me), I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now,” Smollett said in an interview on “Good Morning America.”

Well, then.

While there’s still no way of knowing exactly what happened in the Smollett case, there’s no doubt that big-name liberals rushed to accept the original report of the attack unquestioningly.

In a Twitter post, before any investigation had a chance to take place, Booker said the Smollett attack was an “attempted modern-day lynching.

Pelosi called it “racist” and “homophobic” and an “affront to our humanity.”

According to his lawyers, Smollett will continue to cooperate with law enforcement authorities.

But no matter how it plays out, the celebrities and major Democrats who leaped at the chance to pontificate about the Smollett attack report should have learned a lesson about the potential for embarrassing themselves."

It was closing time Saturday, and Sal Trejo waited for a car to pick up him and a group of friends in the Salt Lake City night.

An unidentified man was also looking for his ride, and Trejo, 29, said the man told someone on his phone that he was standing next to a “gay guy.”

Trejo is a “proud gay man,” he told the Washington Post on Monday, and the man in a green T-shirt did not know him. It was rude and unsettling, he said, for a stranger to approach him and say that. He said his friends intervened.

Trejo said he pulled out his phone to begin recording after the man used an anti-gay slur. In an eight-second video, the man appeared to want to confirm one thing. “Are you gay, though?” he asked Trejo.

“Oh, I am,” Trejo said. The man shot back: “Oh, then you are gay.” Then he squared up his arms.

Trejo answered, “Yeah, but you called me a …” before the man cut him off with a swing.

The man landed a blow on Trejo’s upper arm, he later said. Trejo’s phone sailed to the ground as several onlookers gasped. The man was picked up before police arrived and before Trejo gave a report to police, Trejo said.

Trejo posted the video on Twitter, appealing for help in identifying the alleged attacker. “I want people to be safe,” he said. “Nobody wants to feel unsafe in their town.”

The suspect is cooperating with the investigation, the Salt Lake City Police Department said on Twitter, where they posted Trejo’s video. Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski, who is gay, also posted the video.

The detective assigned to the case did not return a request for comment. It is not clear how police located the suspect or what role the video played in the search.

The altercation comes amid scrutiny about a high-profile hate-crime investigation involving Jussie Smollett. The “Empire” actor said that after he left a restaurant in Chicago last month, two men assaulted him because he is black and gay. But after questioning and releasing two people of interest without charges, police said new information has “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

CNN, citing unnamed police individuals, reported that investigators are exploring the possibility that Smollett may have orchestrated the assault.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, rejected the report. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” they told CNN in a statement. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Trejo said that as “a queer person of color” he was concerned the assault would prompt similar doubts about his own story. His mother and friends advised him to be careful as news of the attack spread, he said. But the difference here, he explained, was that he had video of the altercation paired with witness accounts.

Utah Sen. Derek Kitchen, the sole openly gay member of the Legislature, cited the alleged assault as further impetus to advance hate crime laws in Utah. “It’s time for the UT Legislature to act on hate crimes legislation,” Kitchen, a Democrat, tweeted.

State Republicans have held up the bill, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. No convictions have occurred under current hate-crime legislation, according to the paper.

Trejo said the video has been difficult to watch, but he hoped releasing it would provide a sense of accountability.

“We live in a digital age,” he said. “People will know what you did.”"

She said it was a modern-day lynching; she said it without evidence; now that the evidence disproved her assumptions, she has nothing to say.

2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris was literally speechless when confronted by reporters about recent revelations that “Empire” star Jussie Smollett may have staged a hate crime in order to allegedly gain attention. Upon initially hearing about the alleged hate crime, Harris accepted it at face-value despite the obvious holes in Smollett’s initial story.

“Jussie Smollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery,” she said on Twitter. “This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

Since then, evidence shows that Smollett may have paid two Nigerian brothers to pull off an elaborate hate crime hoax allegedly because the actor did not appreciate the lack of media attention over a racist letter he received in the mail. When confronted by a reporter on Monday if her opinions regarding the Smollett incident have changed in light of the new evidence, Kamala Harris struggled to utter a phrase before side-stepping the issue.

“Which tweet? What tweet?” Harris asked as the reporter questioned her about the “modern day lynching” comment.

“Um … I … I … Okay, so I will say this about that case, the facts are still unfolding, and, um, I’m very, um, concerned about obviously, the initial, um, allegation that he made about what might have happened,” she said. “And it’s something we should all take seriously whenever anyone, um, alleges that kind of behavior, but there should be an investigation. And I think that once the investigation has concluded then we can all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.”

Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman for the Republican National Committee, has since criticized Kamala Harris for seemingly not remembering her being quick to blame Trump supporters for the Jussie Smollett attack.

“Kamala Harris had no problem using inflammatory rhetoric to tie the #JussieSmollettHoax to @realDonaldTrump & his supporters,” tweeted McDaniel. “Now that she has the facts, why can’t she even remember her divisive language? Why is she giggling about it?”

It is important to note that Harris has not deleted her poorly-aged tweet in support of Smollett as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did. The California senator’s deflection echoes that of Cory Booker over the weekend; he told people to withhold judgment until more facts came out.

“The information is still coming out. I’m going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources,” Booker said over the weekend.

Like Kamala Harris, Cory Booker took Smollett’s allegation at face-value without waiting for all the facts to come out.

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe,” Booker tweeted in response to the attack. “To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention.”

While it’s nice that both Harris and Booker believe that evidence and due process should decide someone’s guilt, they were singing a completely different tune during the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing, during which they immediately believed Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual assault against the judge without a shred of evidence or a corroborative witness."

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent? And at different moments...you're seeing the yin and yang of that, the positive and negative of both. Both are just trying to love this child."

Cardi B just went off on Jussie Smollett, claiming the ""Empire"" star single handedly ""f*cked up"" Black History Month.

The ""I Like It"" singer just went on social media and ripped Smollett for allegedly ruining February, all while polishing off a few lobster tails.

""I'm really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, or whatever the f*ck his name is,"" Cardi began, adding, ""I feel like he f*cked up Black History Month, bro.""

The rapper admits she's reserving complete judgement until Smollett tells the whole story, but says if it was all a lie, ""then bro, you f*cked up for real.""

Cardi also thinks Smollett's allegedly fabricated story will be fodder for President Donald Trump and his supporters, explaining, ""You got Donald Trump immunity to f*cking laugh and make motherf*ckers look bad.""

Perhaps the only thing more entertaining than Cardi lashing out, is watching her expertly smash lobster tails without messing up her manicure.

Cardi's not the only celeb clowning on Smollett, as Snoop Dogg jumped into the mix Monday afternoon with a photoshopped image of Smollett as O.J. Simpson during the infamous Bronco chase.

Now that it appears Smollett may have fabricated the story, and may have been willing to send two others to prison over it, those who were quick to rush to judgement are not as quick to issue a mea culpa. Instead, they’re pretending that they didn’t do anything wrong.

Let’s take Brian Stelter, for example. As host of CNN’s Reliable Sources, his job is to call the media out on bad reporting. Over the weekend, he said that it wasn’t really reporters who accepted Smollett’s story, it was activists and celebrities. Umm, not so much.

Today, @brianstelter: ""There was a rush to judgment… mostly in the celebrity press… activists… Twitter people. I think it was a really careful reporting by news organizations.""

If you can’t see it in Bier’s tweet, Stelter’s own network posted this:

On the same panel, Bill Carter told Stelter that the ABC interview was a celebrity interview, not a news interview. You mean this one, where the words “ABC NEWS” feature prominently?

“Suppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so bad as it was made out. Is one’s first feeling, ‘Thank God, even they aren’t quite so bad as that,’ or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies are as bad as possible? If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to wish that black was a little blacker. If we give that wish its head, later on we shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally we shall insist on seeing everything — God and our friends and ourselves included — as bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of pure hatred.”

Yep. People would rather having violent bands of MAGA-wearing criminals roaming the streets of Chicago hurting innocent people than to be wrong.

I’ll leave you with this important question from Jussie Smollett himself:

Who is more to blame? A Devil who spreads obvious lies or a fool who chooses to believe those lies and pass them along? 🤔 #Thoughts — Jussie Smollett (@JussieSmollett) March 22, 2016

The two men accused of attacking Empire actor Jussie Smollett have spoken out for the first time since their arrest.

Ola and Abel Osundairo, who are brothers from Nigeria, were arrested last week to be questioned in relation to the battery but released without charge.

Jussie, 36, reported he had been beaten up in Chicago by two thugs who shouted ‘this is MAGA country’ and other homophobic slurs.

Speaking out for the first time since they were released from police custody, the brothers told CBS 2 in a joint statement: ‘We are not racist.

It comes just as Jussie’s reps told Deadline that the TV actor has no plans to meet with police today amid reports the Chicago Police Department want to question him further to establish exactly what happened during the attack.

The spokesperson told the publication: ‘There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.

‘Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.’

Jussie has been forced to deny rumours that he ‘orchestrated’ the attack amid mounting speculation he may not be telling the truth about the incident.

Slamming the rumours, the actor’s lawyers said in a statement: ‘Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

‘It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.’

Kamala Harris made a big show of things just after news broke last month that ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett allegedly was the victim of a racist, homophobic attack at 2 a.m. on a sub-freezing Chicago street.

The California Democrat — an early candidate for the 2020 presidential election — called the alleged attack on Smollett ""an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.""

Image source: Twitter

But now in the wake of Chicago police sources indicating Smollett may have orchestrated an attack upon himself, Harris sang an altogether different tune Monday in New Hampshire when a reporter asked the senator about her tweet.

'Which tweet? What tweet?'



""Which tweet? What tweet?"" a sheepish Harris replied before looking around in a seemingly confused state as the reporter filled in Harris regarding her own highly publicized Twitter post — and then finally offered the avowed liberal a lifeline: ""Jussie Smollett.""

Harris raised her eyebrows, paused, stammered a bit, and said, ""I will say this about that case. I think the facts are still unfolding, and I'm very concerned obviously."" According to the Associated Press, Harris also said, ""I think that once the investigation is concluded, then we should all comment, but I'm not going to comment until I know the outcome of that investigation.""

Check out part of her answer on video:

Harris was asked about Smollett again Monday during a sit-down interview: ""Are you angry that it looks like now that he may have fabricated this and created a situation in which a lot people came to his defense in a way that now appears to be unwarranted?""

Her response was just as noncommittal: ""Well, I think the facts are still kind of rolling themselves out, so I don't actually know what happened."" She then quickly pivoted to a long monologue about anti-lynching legislation, after which the interviewer never revisited the question.

Harris' answer comes after the 4:15 mark:



<br>

This writer's perspective

Funny that Harris was all-too-eager to jump to conclusions about the Smollett claims when very few facts were available Jan. 29 — but now, when a lot of facts have presented themselves and Smollett looks like another hoax perpetrator, Harris suddenly is reluctant to offer any opinion since, ""I don't actually know what happened.""

Harris' answers Monday were predictably spineless, evasive, and hypocritical. And everybody knows it whether they're willing to admit it or not.

The new alleged motive emerged on Monday as investigators pushed on with their probe into the murky January 29 incident which has divided many and prompted fierce debate over race, police integrity, homophobia and politics.

It tosses up more questions including whether or not the letter, that Smollett received on January 22 and spoke about during an interview with Good Morning America, was real and how it became public knowledge.

It is not clear if the police sources are referring to Smollett not getting enough attention from Fox or in the media.

Jussie Smollett is pictured during his Good Morning America interview on Thursday where he described the threatening letter he received a week before being allegedly attacked

This is the letter Smollett allegedly received at the Fox studio, a week before the January 29 incident

There was no mention of the letter in the public domain until after the January 29 attack had been reported.

A photograph of it popped up on That Grape Juice Net, which describes itself as a source of 'urban music and entertainment news', on January 30.

It included a powdery substance which police investigated and ruled was aspirin or Tylenol. On it were the words 'You will die black f*g', spelled out in cut and pasted magazine letters, and MAGA which was scrawled in red pen.

There was also a stick figure drawing of a man with a gun pointed at his head.

Smollett never tweeted about it nor did he share a photograph of it on Instagram. He did confirm receiving it during his interview with GMA last week where he condemned the skepticism surrounding his account of the attack and referred to the letter, saying: 'Did I make that up too?'

It was previously claimed by other unnamed police sources cited by CBS and ABC Chicago that he was fearful he was going to be written out of Empire and that he wanted to drum up publicity to save his career.

Both Fox and Smollett denied that claim and the police department has refused to confirm it on the record.

Brothers Abel and Ola Osunadairo were released without charge last week after allegedly telling police Smollett paid them to perform the attack

What complicates matters more are the conflicting statements given by Ola and Abel Osundairo, two Nigerian-descent brothers who were questioned over the incident last week, arrested for it and then released without charge when police found mysterious new 'evidence'.

Their lawyer Gloria Schmidt first denied that they had any involvement in the incident, saying they were friends with Smollett who were shocked to learn of the attack with the rest of the world.

Following their release, it was claimed that they had told police that they were involved but that Smollett paid them to carry out the attack.

On Monday, the brothers told CBS during a brief phone call: 'We are not racist.

'We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.'

They did not confirm what they had told police and their lawyer would not respond to DailyMail.com's repeated inquiries.

Smollett's legal team said he has no plans to meet with police again on Monday but that continues to cooperate.

They have vociferously maintained his original version of events which is that he was attacked by two assailants as he walked home from a Subway at 2am on January 29.

Smollett told police he was attacked as he walked home from a Subway at 2am on January 29

The attackers called him 'Empire f****t n****r', poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck, he said.

There is no footage of the attack, to Smollett's despair.

When it emerged on Friday that the brothers had been taken in for questioning, Smollett's team issued a statement to say it seemed 'impossible' that they could be involved.

He knows the brothers, follows them on Instagram and one has worked as an Empire extra in the past.

According to unconfirmed police sources that CBS continues to cite despite repeated push back from the police department officially, they were told by Smollett to buy the rope from a hardware store.

The pair, it is claimed by the sources, were told they would be paid $3,500 initially and that they would get another $500 for the alleged stunt once they returned from Nigeria.

Police are continuing to investigate and have refused to give credence to the theory that the whole attack was a hoax.

Fox declined to comment on the ongoing developments on Monday and it has not given any details of the letter either."

On Monday’s show, Roberts addressed her conversation with the Empire star and noted that Chicago police believed Smollett’s account of what happened to him was credible.

“When I sat down with Jussie it was Tuesday night in Chicago, at the time to give his first account, publicly give his first account of what he said happened,” Roberts said. “At that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.”

Roberts said “police often say something publicly” but have other theories behind the scenes.

During the interview that aired Thursday, Smollett expressed frustration about not being believed by the court of public opinion.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” he said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

He also denied reports that he told police the attackers wore “Make America Great Again” hats.

“I never said that,” the told Roberts. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

Meanwhile, Media Research Center analyst Kristine Marsh called out Roberts for not referring to the attack as “alleged” and instead handled Smollett “as if he were a martyr, with fawning questions.”

“Roberts came to Smollett’s defense, at one point, telling her fellow anchors that his story was ‘credible,’” Marsh wrote.

ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams believes comments the entertainer made during the interview could be used against him if it’s determined that the entire crime was one big hoax.

“In that interview, [Smollett] specifically says, ‘Yeah, those two guys on the surveillance footage, those are the guys that attacked me,’ so now he’s sort of boxed in,” Abrams said.

Smollett claims that two masked men attacked him on Jan. 29 while he walking to his apartment. They allegedly hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck.

“Roberts gave Smollett a soft platform to spin his tall tale less than 24 hours before it was blown to pieces,” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck wrote. “They wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt.”

—Five Americans arrested in Haiti amid violent anti-government protests—

When Robins asked Smollett about folks doubting his version of events, he replied: “At first it was a thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth, then that’s it — cause it’s the truth,” he said. “Then it became a thing of like, oh, how can you doubt that? Like how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.”

As TheGrio previously reported, law enforcement sources connected to the investigation tell TMZ that they are keeping a close eye on the two Nigerian brothers who were arrested and questioned in connection to the alleged hate crime. According to published reports, police suspect Smollett paid the brothers to orchestrate an assault on him but his attorneys refute these allegations.

The brothers were released without charges after investigators discovered “new evidence” that shifted the “trajectory of the investigation,” BBC.com reports."

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

CBS Chicago reported Monday afternoon that the letter and the show's handling of it was the potential motive for what may have been Smollett's false claim that he was attacked by two men in Chicago last month in the middle of the night.

""When the letter didn't get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,"" a source told the station. The story was corroborated by others.

The letter in question, according to CBS, was received by Cinespace Studios in Chicago, where ""Empire"" is filmed, on Jan. 22. It contained white powder and a note made from cut-out letters. The words they spelled were racist and homophobic, CBS noted.

Smollett is gay and black.

The alleged attack happened Jan. 29 in Chicago. Smollett, who according to The Daily Mail landed after a flight from New York City around midnight, said he was out walking at 2 a.m. to get a sandwich from Subway when two men attacked him, poured a chemical on him, put a noose around his neck, and shouted racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett also claimed the attackers said,"" This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Holes have since appeared in Smollett's story, and he is reportedly being investigated for staging the attack with the help of two men he allegedly paid $3,500.

Police said over the weekend the investigation had ""shifted"" after they learned new information. Police asked to interview Smollett again but his lawyer said Monday he had no plans to do so, at least on that day.

Sources told CBS Chicago that one of the men questioned in the attack purchased the rope used to make the noose at a hardware store at Smollett's direction.

The Daily Mail also noted that on the night of the attack, Smollett documented his delayed flight and when he arrived in Chicago on Instagram, which may have been done to alert his ""attackers"" when he would be in Chicago."

A week before the 2016 presidential vote, a historic black church in Mississippi was spray-painted with pro-Trump graffiti and set ablaze, prompting a national spasm of anxiety amid the prospect that the bad old days were back. The Republican Party was hounded for comment on the episode, and reporters attributed the event to the “tense” state of “American politics.” The person charged in this crime was, however, a parishioner, and an official said the arson was designed to appear “politically motivated,” but was not.

Shortly after Mr. Trump’s election, a woman in Ann Arbor, Mich., insisted that she was approached by a white man who threatened to set her on fire if she did not remove her hijab. A Michigan lawmaker tied the case to the president-elect, who he said empowered “devastating racism, sexism and xenophobia.” But the police came to the conclusion that the whole thing was a hoax.

A week after the election, an Episcopal church in Indiana gained national attention when it was painted with homophobic slurs, swastikas and pro-Trump language. The self-identified gay man who later confessed to the crime was the church’s organist. Investigators said he hoped to “mobilize a movement after being disappointed” by the election results.

A few weeks later, an 18-year-old Muslim woman alleged that a group of the president’s supporters attacked her at a New York City subway station and tried to rip her hijab off her head. New Yorkers rallied to her defense. Anti-racist demonstrations in Grand Central Station were organized, and significant police resources were devoted to investigating the case. She was later charged with misleading investigators.

All of these events occasioned deep dives by the press into the forces of racial animus Mr. Trump unleashed during his campaign. But there was no chastened soul-searching when the deceptions were exposed. And few entertain the possibility that the attention these allegations generate has created an incentive structure for prospective hoaxers.

Perhaps most damningly, the kind of scrutiny and anger reserved for incidents of racial hatred seem limited to episodes that confirm what social justice activists believe should constitute American bigotry. There have been no similar national paroxysms amid a sharp uptick in violence targeting New York City’s Jewish population. Maybe that’s because Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn don’t register for these activists as prototypical victims of violent prejudice.

The real tragedy in all of this is that hate crimes are, in fact, on the rise in the Trump era, particularly against Jews and Muslims. It is natural and noble to want to respond proactively to that condition. But well-intended observers risk indulging their biases by suspending disbelief. Whether it is Donald Trump implying that the criminal acts of one illegal immigrant are indicative of a plague of migrant violence or establishment Democrats citing one dubious story to indict half the country, there is no justice in treating individuals not as individuals but as representatives of their tribe."

Left-Leaning Media Runs Interference For Jussie Smollett,[],https://www.dailywire.com/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/uploads/2019/02/gettyimages-1127060645.jpg?itok=3z0b7H2V,"['interference', 'runs', 'smolletts', 'smollett', 'media', 'sources', 'attack', 'maga', 'press', 'leftleaning', 'conservatives', 'seized', 'attacked', 'empire', 'jussie']","The left-leaning media realized, over the weekend, that it made an error in not being more skeptical of “Empire” star Jussie Smollett’s claim that he was attacked by two anti-gay, racist, Trump-supporting Chicago-dwellers back in late January. But instead of taking responsibility, journalists with high profile outlets like CNN and the Associated Press flipped the script, blaming conservatives for “pouncing” and “seizing” on Smollett’s misdeeds.

CNN’s Brian Stetler was the first to suggest that mainstream media approached the Smollett case with skepticism, telling viewers on Monday that it was “entertainment media” and other online blogs that ran with Smollett’s story of being attacked, not reputable sources like, say, CNN.

“I think it was mostly in the celebrity press and among activists and among Twitter people. I think it was a really careful reporting by news organizations. But it all gets lumped in together at the end of the day,” Stetler said.

Stetler was echoing a similar point made on his “Reliable Sources” program Sunday, captured by Mediaite, where he and guests claimed that no mainstream media sources fell for Smollett’s evidence-free, unqualified claims. Stetler seemed reticent to acknowledge that few media sources pursued the obvious flaws in Smollett’s original story, and that local Chicago media was left to pick up the case, pursuing Smollett’s claims and the Chicago Police Department’s response for weeks until the story blew wide open last Saturday.

“On CNN’s Reliable Sources, Vox’s Liz Plank emphatically made this point, saying she couldn’t find ‘a real reputable media outlet reporting’ that the attack was motivated by MAGA or included a statement about ‘MAGA country,'” Mediaite discovered. “I couldn’t find one,” Plank said. “We can’t confuse celebrity tweets with the media and the press.”

But Mediaite’s Caleb Howe, who captured Plank’s quote, ultimately compiled a neat list of mainstream media sources that adopted Smollett’s version of events, using terms like “attacked” and “beaten” without qualifying them with terms like “allegedly” or “claims.”

From Newsweek, for example:

The list, of course, includes CNN, which reported that Smollett had been “attacked,” and The Washington Post, where “Democracy Dies in Darkness.”

Today, @brianstelter: “There was a rush to judgment… mostly in the celebrity press… activists… Twitter people. I think it was a really careful reporting by news organizations.”

The Associated Press jumped on the “conservatives pounce” bandwagon Monday morning wth a story of their own, acknowledging that Smollett’s story was quickly unraveling, but noting that while the developments left some “baffled” and “outraged,” conservatives “seized” on the moment to … well … the Associated Press doesn’t make that particularly clear.

“Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen,” the AP reported. “‘And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,’ Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push ‘the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.'”

So far, though, Smollett’s case seems to be falling apart faster than conservatives can adequately “seize” the moment, leaving it difficult to blame right-leaning media for the full affair. By Monday afternoon, new reports emerged, noting Smollett’s potential motive in staging the attack, and claiming that Smollett is now refusing to speak to Chicago police."

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent? And at different moments...you're seeing the yin and yang of that, the positive and negative of both. Both are just trying to love this child."

And every bit of it is their own fault.

You have to want to believe that Trump-loving rednecks prowl the streets of Chicago in wee hours of arctic nights looking for black guys to attack with bleach and clothesline. You need to abandon logic to accept that said rednecks saw -- and recognized -- Smollett, that they beat him up for fewer than 6o seconds without causing him to drop his phone or his sandwich, that they put a noose around his neck and poured what must have been frozen bleach on him. Or that it was perfectly normal that he never took the noose off his neck or that …

Here are some of the worst reactions from progressive politicians, journalists and entertainers, both to the initial story and its subsequent exposure as a fraud.

1) GQ not only was sure Smollett had been attacked, it knew who’d done it and its earth-shaking significance for the future. The magazine hyped an article on the attack with a tweet asserting, “The racist, homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is far-right America's endgame.”

2) Cory Booker fell for Smollett’s hoax hook, clothesline and sinker. “The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.” Now that the story has fallen apart, Booker says he will keep his mouth shut until more details come out. Better late than never.

2.5) Kamala Harris loses points for reading from the same talking points as Booker: “This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

3) MSNBC analyst Zerlina Maxwell wasn’t satisfied at the speed with which her fellow lemming headed for the cliff, tweeting “The media is broken. If they can't call the attack on Jussie racist straight up then they need to find alternative employment. Apparent HATE CRIME? Sure bc that has a legal definition.” She then concluded with, “pouring bleach onBlack person while you are yelling about MAGA = RACIST.”

4) Confronted by the disintegrating hate story, Wrinkle in Time Director and VH1 Trailblazer recipient Ava DuVernay did the Twitter equivalent of sticking her fingers in her ears and shouting “I can’t hear you!”: “Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility?” When someone pointed out that DuVernay was clinging too hard to the fake attack, she replied, “He might have lied. He might be not have. I don’t know. But what I do know? I never believe police on general principle just ‘cause they say so.”

5) Washington Post writer Eugene Scott Writing for the paper’s “The Fix,” section went right to the top to make some political hay: “To many, the Smollett incident — and the political nature of the assault — is yet another reminder for many black gay Americans that this president’s vision of a ‘great America’ does not appear to include them.”

6) CNN’s Don Lemon took the attack as a chance to educate us all on the hardship of being “black, gay, and famous.” Appearing on actress Jada Pinkett-Smith’s web show “Red Table Talk,” the anchor dismissed doubts about Smollett’s account, saying “When something happens to you and it’s controversial, everyone is coming for you, and so I knew everyone would be picking apart his story.”

7) Actress Viola Davis demanded that everyone get “personally” upset over the “attack.” She tweeted, “OMG!! THIS is why the LGBTQ community continue[s] to fight to be seen and PROTECTED against hate! We ALL have to take this racist and homophobic act of violence very personally!” When we see one, we will.

8) Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi also declared support for Smollett, tweeting out “the racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love… May we all commit to ending this hate once and for all.” Pelosi, a little more self-aware than the other posters it seems, deleted the tweet shortly after more evidence surfaced.

9) One-time conservative earned her keep as a CNN talking head reminded harrumphed that supporters -- the people who’d been slimed and assumed guilty of a transparently bogus crime -- shouldn’t celebrate their vindication. “The giddiness among Trumpsters over the Smollett news is gross. This story is awful. He allegedly abused police resources, exploited raw divisions in this country, and made it harder for every victim of a hate crime to report. This is sad no matter your politics.”

10) Finally, what list of awful takes would be complete without CNN’s Brian Stelter, the Baghdad Bob of media analysts. On Saturday, he got a little snippy about having to explain away another media self-immolation. Some choice quotes: “And when you’re looking at those random websites all over the web spreading information, you can end up, I think, having – This story was able to be weaponized in many different ways.” C’mon Brian, the news media doesn’t maybe have a teensy bit to do with facilitating the hoax? “I think in retrospect, that Good Morning America interview which allowed him to tell his side of the story, that just made things worse for him. Perhaps the questioning was not tough enough on Good Morning America.” Now he tells us."

Ms West added that Monday will have highs of 82F (28C), possibly even 84F (29C), and it will continue to get warmer as the week goes on.

From Tuesday until Thursday, temperatures could hit anywhere from to 90F, with Wednesday expected to be the warmest day of the week.

Ms West said the focus of the heat will be in the west, due to an eastern breeze that will cool down that part of the country.

Does the same apply to this story of an assault at gunpoint in Tennessee against two Trump supporters? Or does this sound too stupid to be made up?

Hint: This one has witnesses and an admission:

The police report confirms that the suspect, identified as James Phillips, admitted to flipping off Pierce and Pierce’s wife because of their hats. Pierce tells 13 News that he was shopping with his wife when Phillips “Pulled a .40 caliber out and stuck it in my face, backed up and said, ‘It’s a good day for you to die.'” Pierce went on to tell 13 News, “I said, ‘Then pull the trigger. Put the gun down and fight me or pull the trigger. Whichever one you want.’ And he backed up and he said it again, he said, ‘It’s a good day for you to die.'”

Rather than let the perp leave on his own after this initial confrontation, Pierce followed him outside while police responded. That may not have been the smartest response to the situation. The police later found the .40 caliber in Phillips’ back pocket with a bullet chambered, along with two other loaded magazines.

How did this master criminal get caught? Pierce accosted him outside the Sam’s Club in case he tried to flee. Unfortunately for Phillips, his mom spoiled his getaway:

Pierce said the Phillips then took off. That’s when Pierce followed him out into the parking lot. “I went out the front of the store to confront him again and that’s when I got him in his car. He couldn’t leave because his mother was still in the store. And we were having a verbal altercation outside,” said Pierce.

Note to other would-be political activists with firearms: Don’t take Mom on your crime sprees. Especially at Sam’s Club, where she’s likely to get caught up in the free samples or the satellite-TV service desks. If you need a getaway driver, take Dad, who’d be happy to get the hell out of the store.

This could have turned out much worse for Pierce and his wife. It’s good that he got Pierce arrested, but it’s beyond foolish to pursue an armed man who just threatened your life with a gun. Witnesses were already there to testify to the exchange, but it’s a lot easier for police to arrest and convict the suspect when the victim is still alive.

This is beyond stupid for the suspect. Phillips had a carry permit in Tennessee, but that won’t last long after this. Even showing the weapon during a confrontation would be considering “brandishing,” a crime which would revoke the permit and carry criminal penalties. What Phillips did in pointing the gun and making the threat constitutes aggravated assault, a crime which could put Phillips behind bars for three to fifteen years.

And it could have been worse. Phillips might have picked on someone who had his own carry permit and found out the hard way that pulling a gun on someone is one of the few ways a permit holder can commit justifiable homicide. Too bad Phillips sleepwalked through his permit training.

Anyway, we can now sit back and watch as the media paints all Trump opponents as violent and deranged after this one attack, confirmed by police and witnesses. Isn’t that the way this works? It certainly did in the Jussie Smollett case."

But it's increasingly difficult to believe that Smollett was uninvolved, given that the two men captured on surveillance video near the scene of the alleged attack are by all accounts Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, a pair of brothers who worked as extras on Empire.

Many people, of course, suspected that Smollett was lying from the start. His claim that he was attacked by random Trump supporters in downtown Chicago at 2:00 a.m. on one of the coldest nights imaginable was hard to swallow. Those who work in right-leaning and alternative media were most vocal, though I had private conversations with several left-of-center writers who shared my doubts.

In contrast, many left-leaning politicians, celebrities, and media figures rushed to condemn Trump supporters as complicit in an obvious hate crime. GQ's Joshua Rivera declared that ""The Racist, Homophobic Attack on Jussie Smollett Is Far-Right America's Endgame."" He also accused all those who referred to Smollett as the victim of a ""potential"" hate crime of inflicting an additional ""wound"" on Smollett. Cautious authority figures were engaged in ""a careful hedging of bets that don't need to be hedged,"" he wrote. Suffice it to say, this piece has not aged well.

No doubt some conservatives went looking for holes in Smollett's story because they wanted to rebut a criticism of President Donald Trump (i.e., that his rhetoric emboldens racists and bigots). But many liberal pundits and thinkers simply believed Smollett because it confirmed all of their biases about the president's supporters. On Monday, in the wake of revelations about Smollett's likely deception, The Washington Post's Jonathan Capehart told MSNBC that what happened to the black, gay actor ""fit in with a narrative."" Before he even finished the word ""narrative,"" he corrected himself: ""not a narrative, but a reality for a lot of people in this country since President Trump was inaugurated."" Many on the left believe that Trump has unleashed a wave of racist, xenophobic, bigoted hatred across America, irrespective of the details of a single incident.

But despite Trump's very real history of making disparaging remarks about all kinds of people, there is not a lot of statistical evidence to support the notion that hate crimes are surging. While it's true that the FBI's count of hate crimes rose 17 percent from 2016 to 2017, it's important to note that 1,000 additional agencies reported information to the FBI in the latter year. It should go without saying, but as the number of agencies participating in the FBI's count of hate crimes grows more numerous, the total number of hate crimes will undoubtedly rise. This does not necessarily mean that hate crimes are surging—just that the authorities undercounted them previously.

Statistics, of course, are easily mischaracterized. A few months ago, many in the media became obsessed with a figure from the Anti-Defamation League, which purportedly showed that anti-Semitism had spiked a whopping 57 percent under Trump. But part of that statistic reflected an increase in bomb threats against U.S.-based Jewish institutions perpetrated by just one person: a deranged Israeli teenager. Anti-Semitic violence, according to the ADL's count, actually decreased 47 percent.

Hate crimes do happen. But some alleged hate crimes turn out to be mistakes or hoaxes. Quillette's Andy Ngo has compiled a useful list; in writing about free speech on college campuses, I have frequently encountered alleged bias incidents that turned out to be false. (My forthcoming book, Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump, contains many more examples.) Recently, virtually everyone in the media uncritically accepted claims by a Native American man, Nathan Phillips, that a group of Catholic high school boys racially harassed him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, but additional reporting showed his claims were wildly misleading.

None of this means that racism and other forms of bigotry are nonexistent, or even that they're rare. But reality is often quite complicated, and it's important for reporters to add context, clarification, and caveats when discussing the news—no matter how much this displeases the automatically-believe-victims crowd.

(Below, watch Reason contributor Kmele Foster—who hosts the Fifth Column podcast with Matt Welch and Michael C. Moynihan—attempt to inform Vox's Liz Plank about the finer points of the FBI's hate crime statistics as she repeatedly interrupts him.)"

Included in the number of hasty haters was none other than that great maven of American justice, Nancy “a wall (other than mine) is an immorality” Pelosi (here and here).

Nance posted the following:

“The racist, homophobic attack on [Smollett] is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love.”

Pelosi’s response presumably could’ve been forgiven, had Jussie been female (though we’re increasingly being told there’s no such thing – here, here, and the video here), filed under #BelieveAllWomen (here). But what’s society coming to, if we have to also immediately believe those nasty critters, men? That would severely hinder the destruction of Brett Kavanaugh; say it ain’t so.

Jussie’s claims were substantial. But, to give you the King James Version, the story did stinketh.

And now, as reported by CNN:

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation tell CNN that Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month. … One of the [alleged attackers] has appeared on “Empire,” Guglielmi said. A police source also told CNN on Friday night that the men had a previous affiliation with Smollett, but did not provide additional details.

Nancy’s tweet has since been deleted. Will she come out and apologize robustly, saying it was dumb of her to rush to judgement? If so, could she go ahead and list all the other things that were dumb of her?

Not likely. CNN’s response to its own (see the video below) — as well as much else of the Left’s — failure to take a “wait and see” attitude toward the story was to BLAME TRUMP SUPPORTERS. What better illustration of bias could there be? The media castigated conservatives for an unverified story, and now they shame the group they excoriated:

The giddiness among Trumpsters over the Smollett news is gross. This story is awful. He allegedly abused police resources, exploited raw divisions in this country, and made it harder for every victim of a hate crime to report. This is sad no matter your politics. — S.E. Cupp (@secupp) February 17, 2019

She’s right — it is sad, no matter your politics.

""This is sad no matter your politics."" https://t.co/DuqLVATWrb — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 17, 2019

One twitterer had it right:

Trump supporters had zero involvement in this whole fiasco. Anti-trump created the plan. Anti-trump carried out the plan. Anti-trump pushed the media narrative. Anti-trump will not apologize. Anti-trump will say pro-trump deserve part of the blame. — BadgerinFlorida (@BadgerinFlorida) February 17, 2019

And an irritated woman was on target:

What America should be doing is giving the media it’s anger in full . Smollett is a tool you used to look down, pass judgement and divide this country. Don’t try to pivot out of this SE. What media did was just as bad as the crime, hoax or not. — IrritatedWoman™ (@irritatedwoman) February 17, 2019

Then there was this extremely good point:

Again. And they learned nothing since doing it to the Covington teens a few weeks prior. Except they hired Tom Hanks to lecture us all in a $5M dollar ad in the middle of the Super Bowl. Can’t imagine why we’d be giddy. — The Smirking Hillbilly (@LauraLMonroe33) February 17, 2019

Perhaps more unfortunate than Pelosi’s post — not to mention the lack of her impending commensurate repentance — is the fact that it was liked by over 100,000 and spread via some 20,000 retweets.

Despite modern times’ incredible access to information, we survive as political animals in a cage built by a famous phrase: “A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.” As of late, the media and the Left have switched to velcro.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

Jussie Smollett allegedly rehearsed his horrific “attack” days before the incident took place.

TMZ reports that police claim that Abel and Ola Osundairo revealed to them that they got in a car with Jussie and looked for a location, settling on the one right outside the actor’s apartment. They looked for a location that would be in direct view of a camera.

Apparently, the star decided to carry out the attack because a threatening letter he received a week earlier failed to get a bigger reaction. CBS 2 reports that Smollett was upset about the lack of attention the letter had received at Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, where “Empire” is set. CBS wrote that “when the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack.”

The brothers reveal that they were told to get “physical” with the actor.

In addition, it is reported that the brothers played out the attack as usual and screamed that they recognized Jussie from “Empire.” They also shouted homophobic epithets at him.

The brother’s claim that they did not intend to harm Jussie.

The report states that Smollett had been in New York City auditioning for a role in a reboot of the 2003 Tony Award-winning play “Take Me Out,” a story about a gay, biracial baseball player victimized by racism and homophobia. The play’s main character is abused with the same language that Smollett’s alleged attackers yelled at him. Following his audition, Smollett flew back to Chicago, where he was allegedly attacked in the wee hours of the morning.

Smollett alleged that two men wearing Make America Great Again hats attacked him at a Subway in Chicago, yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him and screamed “This is MAGA country.” The alleged attack sparked an outcry from prominent Democratic politicians, some of whom used the incident to impugn supporters of President Donald Trump.

However, new details have emerged about the alleged incident and Chicago police now believe that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to help stage the attack. Smollett and his lawyers have denied allegations of a hoax and maintain that the incident occurred as he described.

At the end of January, all of Black America was up in arms about the alleged attack on one of the cast members from the hit FOX series, Empire. Support came far and wide, even getting a response from the president, as people were aghast at Jussie Smollett’s racially and homophobic fueled beating outside of a Chicago Subway restaurant by two men yelling “Its MAGA Country” at 2am in the morning. See… even typing it… it sounds like an episode from the urban music soap opera.

The story goes, there were about two frightening letters sent to the network with a threat about Smollett. Weeks later, on the coldest day of the year, Smollett decided that he wanted to get some Subway (a tuna sandwich) to eat. While approaching the restaurant, he was attacked by two mysterious MAGA loving men who beat him up, poured bleach on him and also put a noose around his neck. Smollett did not originally call the police, but when he did, he was less than cooperative and did not hand over his phone. When he finally handed the phone over, he had edited messages and numbers. Shortly after this, a Robin Roberts’ interview and a whole lot of sympathy, the two Africans are picked up and the truth is seeping out.

Now with the release of new evidence, few are inclined to believe the actor/ singer.

Last week, we heard that two Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, were taken in as suspect. Big, Black and buff, they are far from what you expect when you hear “MAGA” mania. Still, people gave the whole situation the benefit of the doubt, as surely Smollett is not that attention crazed to fake everything.

TMZ now reports, that the two Nigerian brothers have flipped on Smollett. Days before “the incident” took place, the two men met up with Smollett and actually rehearsed and filmed a practice beat down. According to investigative site, the two brothers told law enforcement that they even drove around with Smollett to scout the location, finding one not far from the actor’s apartment. The young men tell authorities that though Smollett wanted it to be a “physical thing,” the didn’t want to get hurt.

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett was so irked that a racist threat letter he says was sent to him didn’t spark public outrage that he hired two men to stage a hate attack on him, according to reports Monday.

Multiple sources with direct knowledge of the investigation pointed to the letter as a potential motive in the actor-singer’s increasingly baffling case, CBS’ Chicago affiliate reported.

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS.

That was the story brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo told police. They also said they were hired by Smollett as the “attackers,” according to the ABC station in Chicago.

Investigators are probing the information that the Osundairo brothers gave them about the letter allegedly motivating the bogus attack, but they have not yet confirmed it.

Cops are seeking to reinterview Smollett, but the actor did not meet with them Monday.

“Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf,” the star’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said in a joint statement.

A grand jury is scheduled on Tuesday to start weighing indictment charges of filing a false police report against Smollett, but the proceeding may be postponed for cops to continue gathering evidence, TMZ reported.

The Osundairo brothers will testify voluntarily and have not received immunity from prosecution.

The development is only the latest twist in the bizarre narrative surrounding the alleged attack on Smollett.

He initially claimed he was walking home from a Subway restaurant in Chicago at 2 a.m. Jan. 29 when he was accosted by two men who shouted racial slurs, tied a noose around his neck and doused him with a “chemical substance” resembling bleach.

A week before he was allegedly attacked, Smollett claimed he received a suspicious letter at Fox Studios in Chicago.

“You will die black f-g,” read the message, written with letters cut out from a magazine.

The letter was opened on Jan. 22 and featured a photo of a stick figure apparently hanging from a tree and a gun pointing at it. “MAGA” was scrawled in red letters on the envelope.

The letter also contained a white powdery substance, which prompted a hazmat response.

Chicago police said the substance was later determined to be pulverized aspirin. The FBI has taken over the probe into the letter.

Smollett, 36, was upset that the news of the letter didn’t get a “bigger reaction,” sources told the CBS station.

However, it was still not clear on Monday whether the letter was a part of Smollett’s alleged hoax or a legitimate threat.

A magazine was seized during a raid on the Osundairos’ home by Chicago cops last week. It wasn’t clear if cops were attempting to link the magazine to the letter sent to Smollett.

Police also took a sample of writing from the brothers and a wallet containing a book of postage stamps, CBS reported, citing police evidence logs from the raid.

The Osundairos on Monday made their first public statement since being identified in the Smollett saga.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” they told CBS in a statement.

The siblings admitted to cops that they rehearsed the attack against Smollett — and even scouted locations with him beforehand, TMZ reported, citing law enforcement sources.

They reportedly chose a spot near Smollett’s apartment in the ritzy Streeterville neighborhood because Smollett allegedly believed a surveillance camera would capture the attack. Police later found that the camera actually picked up nothing because it was pointed in the wrong direction.

Smollett allegedly informed the pair that he wanted the assault to be a “physical thing” but warned them that he didn’t want to be seriously injured, TMZ reported.

It added that the Osundairos told cops they “made contact” with Smollett’s face but it was “weak.”

Cops believe Smollett may have been posting stories on Instagram to tip off the Osundairos to his whereabouts in the hours before the attack, according to the Daily Mail.

Olabinjo and Abimbola were arrested last Wednesday but released without charges two days later as police revealed new evidence in the case had “shifted the trajectory” of their investigation.

I filed this column late -- about 20 years late.

My brother, a Los Angeles-based marketing specialist who came out as gay two decades ago, often urges me to write more about the LGBTQ community. I'm missing a big story, he says.

But, I tell him, I need a news peg. Now, suddenly, I have my pick.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, the uprising in New York's Greenwich Village in June 1969 credited with sparking the gay and lesbian civil rights movement.

It also seems we're living through an LGBTQ moment.

-- Last week, Jussie Smollett, a gay African-American actor who stars in the Fox drama ""Empire,"" addressed doubts about his claim that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago on Jan 29. Smollett says that two men yelled slurs, hit him, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck while shouting, ""This is MAGA country!"" In an emotional interview Thursday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" the actor called ""ridiculous"" the idea that he would lie about such a thing, as some have alleged. Smollett told co-anchor Robin Roberts: ""You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.""

-- A few days after the alleged assault on Smollett, during an appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" actress Ellen Page launched her own attack. Page, who is married to a woman, took aim at Vice President Mike Pence. Page said Pence tried to ban same-sex marriage when he was Indiana governor, and said the vice president believes in conversion therapy. She accused Pence of ""hating"" LGBTQ people and wanting ""to cause suffering."" She blamed the vice president for the alleged attack on Smollett and other assaults against LGBTQ folks. ""This needs to f------ stop!"" Page said to rousing applause.

-- Then Page slammed actor Chris Pratt after the star of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" -- during an appearance of his own on Colbert's show -- discussed his church. In a tweet, Page called Pratt's house of faith -- Hillsong Church -- ""infamously anti-LGBTQ."" According to Variety, in 2015, church executives drew criticism for calling homosexuality a sin. Pratt rejected Page's accusation and fired back with a post on Instagram, saying that ""nothing could be further from the truth."" His church, he claims, ""opens their doors to absolutely everyone ... regardless of sexual orientation, race or gender.""

-- In Texas, a gay couple was brutally beaten on Jan. 19 in an apparent hate crime committed by four men who have since been arrested. According to the police report, Spencer Deehring and Tristan Perry were holding hands as they left a gay club in downtown Austin when they heard a man shout a homophobic slur. More obscenities followed, as the man motioned for the others to join him. One of the men punched Perry to the ground, and Deehring was also attacked when he tried to defend Perry, according to the report. With both men on the ground, the cowards allegedly punched and kicked them until they were unconscious. Deehring suffered cuts and a minor concussion while Perry had a major concussion, internal bleeding and a broken nose.

-- Finally, just this past week, in San Diego, in what authorities are calling a hate crime, a gunman opened fire in the Hillcrest neighborhood, which is considered the epicenter of the city's LGBTQ community. Armed with a high-powered AR-15 rifle, Stefano Parker allegedly shot 19 rounds through the window of restaurant after posting an anti-LGBTQ comment on Facebook. There were nine people in the establishment, but no one was hurt. Parker was charged with nine counts of attempted murder.

Just curious. What decade is this? I'm asking for friends and family.

The conventional thinking is that -- with millions of dollars in AIDS funding, the Supreme Court having struck down laws banning gay marriage, and scores of LGBTQ characters and storylines on film and television -- all the battles have been fought and won.

Not even close. Members of that community say they fear a rollback of hard-earned rights, privileges and protections, and that they'll force the issue in the 2020 presidential election. This is the conversation America needs to have.

In the 1990s, the mealy-mouthed compromise was: ""Don't ask, don't tell."" Today, in many families, it's more like: ""Don't talk, don't share.""

Our fellow Americans are hurting. They're marginalized, threatened and beaten. Then they're told there is something wrong with them.

This has to f------ stop!

These Headlines Prove Otherwise.,[],https://www.dailywire.com/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/uploads/2019/02/gettyimages-952394464.jpg?itok=CSnfcTOw,"['crime', 'reported', 'didnt', 'headlines', 'media', 'prove', 'attack', 'claims', 'attacked', 'possible', 'jussie', 'smollett', 'hate', 'walsh', 'mislead']","Only days after smearing the Covington Catholic students with an out-of-context video clip and the blatant lies of a Native American activist, our illustrious news media yet again beclowned itself with the Jussie Smollett debacle. Many outlets somberly reported Smollett’s outrageous “hate crime” fable as fact, betraying not even the faintest hint of skepticism. Now as the story falls apart, and Smollett is revealed as a fraud and a liar, the media has been presented with a valuable opportunity for honest self-assessment. As always, it will decline the invitation.

Instead, we are now being informed that mainstream news organizations reported the Smollett story fairly from the beginning. They weren’t duped, they insist. Hollywood celebrities and Democratic politicians may have jumped on the “Smollet is a victim of Trump-inspired terrorism” bandwagon prematurely, but not them. Courageous, truth-seeking, fact-finding journalists could never be guilty of reporting fake news. That’s what they are now telling us anyway, which, ironically, is itself fake news.

Before they stuff their own reporting down the memory hole, I thought it could be worthwhile to catalogue some of the headlines from the days immediately following the fake attack. Let’s look at a brief sampling. Remember, these are not the tweets of celebrities and politicians. These are “reputable” outlets:

CNN: “‘Empire’ Star Jussie Smollett Attacked In Possible Hate Crime”

Identical headlines could be found in the Hollywood Reporter and Deadline. Notice there is only uncertainty about the motivation — possible hate crime — not the attack itself. The lede again states with certainty that an attack occured: “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in the early morning hours on Tuesday in what Chicago police are calling a possible hate crime.” Alisyn Camerota claims that her network was always skeptical of Smollett’s claims. If that’s true, why didn’t the skepticism come through in their reporting?

New York Times: “Jussie Smollett, Star of ‘Empire,’ Attacked in What Police Call a Possible Hate Crime”

Again, only the hate crime is “possible.” The attack itself is reported as fact. There is a big difference between “Jussie Smollett Possibly Attacked In Hate Crime” and “Jussie Smollett Attacked In Possible Hate Crime.” I didn’t even go to journalism school and I know that.

AP: “Jussie Smollett Strikes Emotional Chord: Attackers Won’t Win”

This headilne could have been written by Smollet’s just-hired defense attornies. It is pure propaganda. The word “alleged” appears nowhere in the title or even in the text of the article. Three days after Smollett reported the attack and the AP had already decided that it was an unquestioned and unquestionable fact of history.

Variety: “Chicago PD Seeking ‘Persons of Interest’ in Jussie Smollett Attack; Manager Was on Phone During Incident”

No “alleged.” No “reportedly.” Slightly more cautious wording can be found in the text of the article, but everyone in the media knows that most people only read the headline.

Forbes: “‘Empire’ Actor Jussie Smollett Issues Statement After Vicious Attack: ‘I’m OK'”

The folks over at Forbes knew they had to put some kind of qualifying word in front of “attack.” But than something like “alleged” or “possible” or “reported,” they went with “vicious.”

I could go on with examples. And I haven’t even listed the most egregious ones, like GQ: “The Racist, Homophobic Attack on Jussie Smollett Is Far-Right America’s Endgame.”

I’ll be told that GQ isn’t a serious news outlet. I agree. But then neither is The New York Times. There aren’t many serious news outlets left in America, as these headlines demonstrate. The media acts not as a purveyor of objective truth but as a leftist PR firm. Their reporting is crafted according to the narrative they wish to convey.

Consider how these headlines would look if a conservative Hollywood actor — say, Dean Cain — claimed that he was jumped by two liberal black men in “Elizabeth Warren For President” t-shirts, who shouted leftist slogans as they stomped him half to death. Imagine, too, that this supposed assault happened in Hunstville, Alabama — “Warren Country,” the attackers supposedly screamed — and there are no witnesses and no footage to confirm the story. It is inconceivable that CNN would publish a headline announcing “‘Gosnell’ Star Dean Cain Attacked In Possible Hate Crime.” If the claim was reported at all, it would be conveyed with extreme (and warranted) skepticism.

Well all know this, of course. It feels redundant to point it out. But we must keep pointing to the truth, over and over again, as the media tries to bury it."

This story alleges a man threatened another with a gun because he was – you guessed it - wearing a MAGA hat.

James Phillips was arrested following an altercation at a Kentucky Sam’s Club on Saturday.

According to WNKY-TV:

Phillips, who was wearing a veterans cap, told police he made the gesture at the man and a woman with him because of the MAGA hats they were wearing, according to his citation. The man then confronted Phillips inside the store and an argument began. That man then made the same obscene gesture to Phillips, according to the citation. At that point, witnesses told police Phillips pointed a gun at the man. That portion of the incident could not be seen on video surveillance. Police encountered Phillips and the couple after being called to the Sam’s Club parking lot where multiple witnesses had called the police to report a man pulling a gun on a couple, according to his citation.

The alleged victim, Terry Pierce, claims the suspect told him, “This is a good day for you to die.”

According to his arrest citation Phillips was carrying a .40 caliber Glock in his right rear pocket.

Phillips was arrested on a first-degree wanton endangerment charge and booked at Warren County Regional Jail.

Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) froze and awkwardly looked around when pressed Monday on her tweet that the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett was a ""modern-day lynching,"" before saying she needed to see all the facts.

Smollet, a gay, black actor, claimed he was the victim of a hate crime in January, saying two men beat him up in a Chicago street, poured bleach on him and placed a rope around his neck. He also said they yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan. The story has taken a turn, with police now reportedly investigating whether Smollett orchestrated the attack himself by paying two Nigerian brothers to do it.

Democratic politicians were quick to believe Smollett's account at the time and tweet out their condemnations, including Harris and other 2020 presidential candidates. She praised the actor as ""one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know"" and said ""this was an attempted modern day lynching.""

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

She seemed unfamiliar with it on Monday when asked about it in New Hampshire.

""Which tweet? What tweet?"" Harris asked a reporter after one brought up the recent developments.

""About saying that it is a modern day lynching,"" the reporter said. Harris looked to her left for an unknown reason and laughed before facing the reporter again, who said, ""Jussie Smollet.""

""Um, uh, OK. So I will say this about that case,"" Harris said. ""I think the facts are still unfolding, and I'm very concerned about obviously the initial allegation that he made about what might have happened.

""And it’s something we should all take seriously whenever anyone alleges that kind of behavior, but there should be an investigation,"" Harris added. ""And I think that once the investigation has concluded then we can all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.""

Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel linked to a clip of the video and criticized her for using ""inflammatory rhetoric"" to tie what she called a hoax to Trump supporters.

""Now that she has the facts, why can't she even remember her divisive language? Why is she giggling about it?"" she wrote.

In an interview posted on Monday, WMUR's Adam Sexton asked Harris if she was ""angry"" that Smollett may have fabricated his story.

""I think the facts are still rolling themselves out, so I don't actually know what happened,"" Harris said, before talking of her effort to lead on a bill that was passed in the Senate making lynching a federal crime.

Harris's sudden concern with waiting for all the facts mirrored that of fellow 2020 contender Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.). Booker, who tweeted the incident was an ""attempted modern-day lynching"" last month, said Sunday in New Hampshire he would withhold comment until more information arose.

""I’m gonna withhold until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources,"" Booker said. ""We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise in a serious way, and we actually even know in this country that since 9/11, the majority of the terrorist attacks on our soil have been right-wing terrorist attacks—the majority of them white supremacist attacks.""

“Okay, so I will say this about that case. I think the facts are still unfolding and I’m very concerned,” Harris answered.

Smollett alleged that two white men attacked him in the middle of the night as he was walking home from a Chicago-area “Subway” restaurant last month. He told police that the men poured a bleach-like substance on him, tied a rope around his neck similar to a noose, and shouted racist and homophobic slurs. Over the past couple days, the police have reported that it appearst that Smollett staged the attack and paid two Nigerian men to attack him.

Many other Democrats rushed to support Smollett following the alleged attack. Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Democratic Reps.

Cops now say they want a follow-up interview with Smollett about what they've been told by the two brothers identified as 25-year-old Abel Osundairo and his brother Ola Osundairo, 27.

A spokesperson for Smollett says that ""there are no plans to meet with the Chicago police today.""

The brothers have appeared as extras on the hit series with Smollett. Police say the brothers are the shadowy figures caught on surveillance cameras the night Smollett says he was attacked. They were released from custody Friday night reportedly agreeing to cooperate.

Chicago TV station WBBM reported that a police source told them it's believed Smollett rehearsed the attack with the two brothers and paid them $3,500 plus an additional $500 when they returned from a trip to Nigeria.

Smollett has been an actor since he was a kid and starred in the 1992 movie ""The Mighty Ducks.” He's one of six children, and joined his brothers and sisters on the Food Network show ""Smollett Eats.”

And they're also looking more and more unbelievable to those who have been following this story.

Scroll down for the latest update on a figure who has quickly gone from sympathetic to suspicious...

Over the past few days, serious doubts have been cast regarding whether or not Smollett was really assaulted by two men on the morning of January 29.

The star told cops late last month that he was walking home around 2 a.m. after getting a bite to eat when a pair of assailants:

Hurled racial slurs and anti-gay epithets in his direction.

Tied a rope around his neck.

Poured a substanced believed to be bleach all over his body.

The incident immediately drew national attention, consider Smollett's level of fame and the despicable nature of this attack.

But did it raelly take place as described by the actor?

With various aspects of his story not making sense, a narrative started to emerge that Smollett may have staged this beating.

Local CBS and ABC affiliates in Chicago both quoted anonymous sources close to the police who said cops were beginning to operate under this theory -- especially after they identified the suspects as Nigerian brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo.

It turns out that these men worked as extras on Empire.

They knew Smollett well.

And they were not white, as Smollett initially told the police; nor were they (seemingly) the kind of people who would scream that Smollett was in ""MAGA country,"" as the actor has also alleged.

Shortly after arresting these men, the cops let them go without pressing any charges.

For what reason?

""Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging,” Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter Friday evening.

He later raised even more concerns and questions when he added:

We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

Yes, the trajectory of the investigation.

Insiders have once again said this means the police strongly suspect that Smollett teamed with the aforementioned siblings to pretend he was assaulted.

Some sources have even alleged he paid them $4,000 for the job.

With authorities wanting to meet with Smollett to discuss aspects of the investigation, a spokesperson for his lawyer said the following on Monday:

""There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.

""Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.""

TMZ, meanwhile, reports that Abel and Ola Osundairo are spilling everything to the cops.

And they are turning on Smollett in the process.

According to this website's latest article on the situation, the brothers have told the police that they got in a car with Smollett and scouted a location prior to the early morning in question, settling on the one right outside the actor's apartment.

The siblings explained Jussie selected the spot because he hoped a camera would capture the action.

He allegedly instructed his co-conspirators to make the beating a ""physical thing,"" but not to rough him up too badly.

Moreover, these suspects say they actually rehearsed the attack and grew anxious when a car drove by just as they were doing so.

Totally crazy and very troubling, right?

It's worth noting that police grew concerned about Smollett's story after he took them to the scene of the supposed crime and did, indeed, point to an obscurely-located camera that he said had maybe recorded the attack.

(He was unaware that the camera was pointed in the wrong direction and therefore did not record anything of substance.)

In his latest statement, made through his legal team, Smollett has maintained that he played no role in this assault.

This is what he said over the weekend:

As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."

A source told CBS Chicago the actor allegedly “concocted” the “staged” Jan. 29 attack and paid his “acquaintances”—brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo—over $3,000 to carry it out.

Smollett reportedly opened the letter on Jan. 22 at Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, and the white powder prompted a HAZMAT team to respond. Chicago Police Department told the news station that the substance turned out to be aspirin. Cinespace Studios would not comment to The Daily Beast about the incident. Fox, Empire's network, also declined to provide comment or confirmation.

The missive itself contained letters cut out from magazines to create “racial and homophobic threats” towards Smollett specifically. During a search of the Osundairo brothers’ home last week, CPD reportedly found and took a “magazine, a wallet with stamps and piece of paper/writing.” According to CBS Chicago, the FBI is now handling the probe into the letter.

In a statement to CBS Chicago, Smollett's lawyers said they have been in contact with the Chicago Police Department.

“Jussie will continue to cooperate with the investigation in an appropriate and respectful manner that does not include talking to the media at this time,” Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson wrote.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump,” the brothers—one, reportedly an Empire extra and the other, Smollett’s ex-personal trainer—said in a statement. “We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

The Osundairo brothers’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, said “all the facts will reveal themselves” in due time. “At the end of the day my clients are honest and credible,” she told CBS Chicago.

The brothers are now reportedly cooperating with the Chicago police after being released without charges. They reportedly fled to Nigeria after the incident and were arrested upon their return to the U.S.

Initially, Smollett claimed two white men attacked him on the streets of Chicago in the early morning hours of Jan. 29. One attacker allegedly wore a red hat while yelling racist and homophobic slurs at him, and the other poured bleach and tied a rope around Smollett’s neck. On a Feb. 14 appearance on “Good Morning America,” Smollett reiterated the racial overtones of the alleged attack.

“They called me a faggot, they called me a n---er,” he said. “There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

It was previously reported by CBS Chicago that at least one of the brothers allegedly purchased a rope “at Smollett’s request” from a hardware store on Jan. 25, and the brothers rehearsed the attack with Smollett days before it took place. The news station also reported that a red hat was also purchased at a neighborhood beauty supply store.

The brothers told officials Smollett paid them $3,500 before they fled to Nigeria after the attack took place and the actor promised them another $500 upon their return, according to CBS Chicago.

Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said there were “some developments” in their probe on Sunday. “Detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,” Guglielmi wrote on Twitter.

Smollett’s attorneys have denied that the attack was staged by their client.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Pugh and Henderson said in a statement Sunday. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”"

Kamala Harris went off in defense of ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett, saying his claims of being attacked by two MAGA hat-wearing Trump supporters on the streets of Chicago was on par with a ""modern-day lynching.""

On Monday, while on tour for her 2020 presidential run, Harris was again asked how she felt about the case and her earlier comments in defense of Smollett, now that Chicago police sources say they believe the actor may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the entire attack.

Suffice it to say, Harris' latest comments didn't go so well. But since I'm not sure how to transcribe so much stuttering, check it out:

Harris has yet to retract, or even address, her earlier tweets calling Smollett ""one of the kindest, most gentle human beings"" she knows and comparing his alleged (and now potentially debunked) attack as a ""modern day lynching.""

Perhaps as a former prosecutor, district attorney and attorney general, Harris should remember that it's important to wait for all the facts before rendering judgement - even when it's not politically convenient."

They referenced his once-hot, now-not TV show in a slighting manner before proceeding to beat him up while informing him this was “MAGA country.” Oh, and they put a noose around his neck.

The only proper response to this claim was, first, to scratch your head at the sheer blazing oddity of it all before realizing in about ten seconds that the whole story was utter nonsense, hooey, balderdash, bushwah—and that Jussie Smollett had made the story up for reasons that remain elusive. Except for this fact: Smollett was celebrated, lionized, made a hero and a martyr all at once merely for spinning the story out. Within hours, presidential candidates and other major political figures were lining up to tweet in his favor. Showbiz people fell over themselves to praise him. A significant element in the American commentariat reacted with all the sorrow and anger and rage that Twitter’s 280 characters could allow.

And all of them together, all these pro-Smollett voices, joined as one in assuming that the hate crime committed against him was par for the course in Donald Trump’s America.

Rather than expressing their shock that this could happen here, the Jussies were beyond eager to believe it was true. So eager that they disconnected from reality. They had to. You had to be delusional to believe the story made a lick of sense.

Those among us who have responded with glee to the growing evidence the story is a hoax are doing so for reasons the liberal commentariat cannot understand—meaning, the ones who either fell for the story or were too terrified of the accusation of insensitivity and unconscious racism even to question it. The point is, when such things happen, those who disregard the reality do not only do so themselves; they insist that everyone else do so as well. Indeed, not to believe in an alleged hate crime is implicitly to participate in a hate crime itself. To question the story is an act of hate. Why, after all, would you do such a thing?

Well, because the thing about crimes is, yes, they happen, and happen all the time—but so do false allegations. And when a certain crime is (for all sorts of reasons) elevated above all others, a certain type of disturbed person can be triggered by the elevation and decide to participate in it. During an outbreak of anti-Semitism, for example, it is wise to be prudent and hold fire when you hear about the defacing of a synagogue with swastikas and the like, because chances are the villain will not be a Nazi but a disturbed Jew. Indeed, following Donald Trump’s election, a series of bomb threats to Jewish institutions terrified people nationwide until it turned out they were the work of a psychotic Israeli teenager working out of his family apartment in Ashkelon.

The same is true of any sort of high-profile crime when the crime becomes a focus of public attention. The horrors visited upon innocent people due to accusations of child sexual abuse and molestation in the 1980s and 1990s should remind people of the potential danger in an atmosphere in which we are told we must “believe all” accusers. In those cases, skeptics were told we needed to “believe the children” when the children were being coached and the stories that emerged from these coaching sessions sounded like fourth-rate horror-movie plots with Satanic clowns violating them on basement altars.

It is precisely at times when people are prone to believe that you begin to see the genius of a common-law system that does not allow accusations to serve as evidence alone.

Culturally, though, the legal standard of reasonable doubt does not apply, which is why we need it in law.

It has ever been thus: For whatever reason, people believe something has happened and then believe the evidence that supports their view and damn others who find that evidence problematic. Say that Christine Blasey Ford’s claims against Brett Kavanaugh cannot be the standard by which he should be judged because she knew neither the place nor the time of the alleged assault and had no contemporaneous evidence to support the claims, and you are part of her ongoing victimization. It’s a perfect tautology, whose purpose is simple: It is there to make you shut up and let the loudest and most truculent arguers control the conversation.

This used to be the province of gossip; now it is the sacred coin of the social-media web. And the social-media web poses increasingly serious dangers to people who do not go along. Their employers can be contacted. Their addresses can be exposed. Thus, their livelihoods and their personal safety can be compromised. That too was always true in a moral panic, but the gossip was limited to those in earshot. Now the attack can come from anywhere on the planet. Almost literally.

In 1984, O’Brien insists that Winston Smith agree 2+2 = 5, and tortures him in unimaginable ways to compel him to do so. The social-media mob’s insistence that one believe an outlandish story or be accused of the worst cultural crime there is thus has some of O’Brien’s sway.

So for those who took a look at Smollett’s cock-and-bull story and thought these thoughts, the fear that accompanied them was particularly discomfiting because they—we—knew we were right and the mob was wrong. People don’t actually get mugged when it’s zero degrees outside; muggers get cold too, and while people who commit hate crimes might be more insensible to the elements owing to their rage, they too might give it a pass to get inside. Nor, generally speaking, do people head out to buy a sub in such weather. I lived through a Chicago polar vortex in 1982. The cold entered my bones and stayed there—inside my apartment. I would sooner have lit myself on fire than willingly gone outside; it would take something more powerful than wanting a sandwich, like a planned staged event.

And where did the muggers get a noose? Why would you carry around a length of rope when it was -15 with the wind chill? And how did they recognize Jussie Smollett in the first place? Was his face exposed to the elements and not covered with a scarf or a hood? Why not?

The skeptics saw all this. And we were feeling the pressure to say 2+2 = 5. And we feel a great relief that the pressure is gone. The glee is born of the relief. But not just that. It’s also the result of watching people who believe themselves to be morally superior because of the views they espouse and the pathological ideas they have about the United States being brought down more than a few pegs because their views led them into such foolish error. Also, as the Twitterite @neontaster said, “it’s A LOT easier to be happy when it turns out something horrible didn’t happen. Gloating if it turns out a terrorist was Muslim (or white) is gross because you’re gloating over an actual incident, not a lack thereof.”

Whatever reason Smollett had for concocting this story in the wake of an unfortunate encounter or for conceiving it and then executing it with paid actors might make for a good TV movie sometime. But that assumes a person in Hollywood would choose to make a picture about a progressive gay black guy doing something wrong.

So I guess I won’t be holding my breath for Ryan Murphy to make “American Crime Story: Jussie Smollett.”"

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in ""MAGA Country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they've requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett's lawyers say the actor feels ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault.

Liberals, I think we Normal Americans need to see other people. In this national cohabitation, we’ve grown apart and maybe it’s time for you liberals to go your own way and find your Venezuelan bliss elsewhere.

Hey liberals, it’s not me. It’s you. Because you suck. So get out.

By the way, the umbrella term “liberals” includes useless Fredocon contingent. After all, these vinyl-clad gimps are attached to their liberal masters by a figurative leash.

Now, I’d prefer we work our problems out and find a solution that keeps us together as one country. But a solution would require liberals to embrace things like freedom, tolerance, and the Constitution, while rejecting their current obsessions, like socialism, cultural fascism and being idiots.

Pretty much what’s required is you liberals realizing that your whole ideology sucks, and stopping doing it. If you’re willing and able to cease being terrible, maybe with some counseling, and a lot of apologies and repentance on your part, we can make it work again. But otherwise, pack your Schiff and get the hell out of my country.

You can have New England. It’s cold and remote and you can’t do much to make it worse. But we get the Patriots. You’re just not worthy of them.

I wrote about a national break-up in my novels People’s Republic, Indian Country, and Wildfire, where the country splits into red and blue nations and – as with every single socialist country in history – the blue side turns into a festering cesspit of poverty, oppression, and misery. That hypothetical break-up is neither clean nor bloodless, and naturally, the blue side blames the red side for its own failures. Basically, the People’s Republic is just like Jussie Smollett blaming the Chicago MAGA-hat crew for all the bad things that befell him, and the people of the People’s Republic are just the random Nigerians who pay the price.

Does a national break-up seem a bit extreme? A bit excessive? Can’t we all just get along? My pal Jesse Kelly has long been calling for a national divorce (and when I realized I was mining a related vein for comedy gold, I called him up and got his OK to use my break-up metaphor because I am not a mainstream media hack), but I used to be pretty confident Normals and libs could reconcile. Now I’m not so sure. After all, in a world of Covington Kid lynch mobs, nuke-curious congressjerks and Democrats siding with anti-Semites, female abusers, and blackface pols, it’s become painfully obvious that liberals hate us Normals and want us dead or enslaved. Call me picky, but I’m not really down with that.

So move out, libs. But peacefully. We should handle this break-up like adults. Just text first so we’re not home when you swing by with banker’s boxes to pack up your junk. Oh, and I’m keeping the dog.

How did it come to this? Well, I have a list.

Because you liberals thought you could just sponge of our hard work for the benefit of the critical Democrat demographic that is those who are “unwilling to work.” Because you thought you could squander our blood on your idiotic and endless crusades overseas. Because you thought you could boss us around and treat us like serfs. But the thing is, you’re not hot enough to stick around with. We’re vibrant, sexy, and industrious people and we’ll be just fine on our own. But you have problems. You can’t grow food, transport it to hungry people, or drill for the fuel to make that happen. All you can do is code, blog and run your fool mouths.

Let’s review. Liberals are super-mad about the original agreement that bound us together as a country because things like the Electoral College and the Bill of Rights prevent them from having absolute power over us. They now want to change our prenup. Hard pass, golddiggers.

Their Deep State pals – I used to think that the whole “Deep State” thing was kooky and wacky until they actually admitted it – have taken it upon themselves to undo and overturn our elections because they think we decided wrong when we rejected Felonia Milhous von Pantsuit. This is problematic, since we never signed on to be ruled by a bunch of unelected liberal bureaucrats who can’t manage to stop a psycho creep who is sounding off on the web about how he plans to shoot up a school but who are totally eager to turn the full weight of American law enforcement upon political enemies. Phew! They got George Papawapaplatypus or whatever his name is off the street for two whole weeks.

Oh, and they want us disarmed because the minute we’re defenseless the left will stop hating us and treat us better. No thanks. Your people in Liberalland can be helpless serfs and in America, we’ll remain armed citizens. Hell, we’ll probably make it mandatory that every citizen has an assault rifle to enable him or her to do his or her basic duty as a citizen to protect the Constitution and the community.

And then there’s the Green New Deal where they are demanding that we give up even more power and money to these urban achievers who want to ban our cars, ban our planes, and ban our rib-eyes as a sacrifice to Gaia the Earth Spirit. Nope. You can do what you want in your own country, including imposing the Weird Weather Cult as your state religion.

And finally, if liberal obstruction lets illegal aliens steal our jobs, steal our identities and steal the lives of our family members, to liberals that’s a small price to pay to achieve their goal of diluting our votes and remaking the electorate in the image of Oaxaca. A bunch of rich and unaccountable sophisticates surrounded by hordes of obedient, toiling peasants – that’s California right now, and that’s what liberals want for the entire country.

The liberals get to be the rich and unaccountable sophisticates, the illegals get to be the peasants, and you and I? Well, we don’t really have a place in that scenario.

So why not let liberals have their own place, where they can do what they want and enjoy living in their own mess? Make AOC president – that would serve you right. Outlaw “hate speech” and “racism” and “bad think” and generally turn your whole new country into one big college campus.

Take New England, libs, with its snow and chowder and Kennedys, and build your pinko Utopia. Would it be congested? Yeah, sure, but hey – you’re all for high-density urban living, right? Packed together, you can use public transportation or ride your ridiculous bikes in your ridiculous bike shorts to your shriveled hearts’ content! In America, we’ll still drive our cars, but look on the bright side – our shameless rejection of the climate change scam will give you something to be endlessly outraged about over there on the other side of the border.

Which we will close off, with a wall.

Again, check out my novels People’s Republic, Indian Country, and Wildfire, if you really want to revel in the politically correct suffering liberals will experience if left to their own inept, fascist devices without having us normal people to parasite off of."

The men -- who attorney Gloria Schmidt identified as Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo -- were arrested Wednesday but released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of ""new evidence.""

In a joint statement issued to CNN affiliate WBBM, the men said: ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollett paid the brothers to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month.

Smollett denies playing a role in his attack, according to a statement from his attorneys.

The sources told CNN the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

Police say they want to talk to Smollett again. The actor's reps said Smollett would not be speaking to police Monday, and it's unclear when he will sit down with investigators.

""Smollett's attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today,"" Anne Kavanaugh with Media Pros 24/7 said.

Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs."" He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

The sources told CNN there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a hardware store in Chicago.

Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo also was released without being charged.

Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement to CNN Saturday night saying Smollett was angry about these latest developments.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Smollett identifies as gay and since 2015 has played the gay character of Jamal on the Fox TV drama ""Empire.""

What happened

According to Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, the actor told detectives he was attacked by two men near the lower entrance of a Loews hotel in Chicago. Police were told the two men yelled ""'Empire' fa***t"" and ""'Empire' n***er'"" while striking him.

In a supplemental interview with authorities, Smollett confirmed media reports that one of the attackers also shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

The day after the incident, police released surveillance images that showed two silhouetted individuals walking down a sidewalk, and police said they were wanted for questioning.

The brothers said in a statement they are not racist or homophobic.

Police on Friday said the men were being viewed as ""potential suspects"" and that detectives had ""probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.""

But by Friday night they had been released , Guglielmi said, ""due to new evidence as a result of today's investigations.""

""And detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" he added.

One of the men has appeared on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. A police source also told CNN on Friday night that the men had a previous affiliation with Smollett, but did not provide additional details.

Smollett has expressed frustration about not being believed

Following the alleged attack, Smollett's colleagues and fans rallied around him, expressing shock and sadness.

""We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows that we are united on a united front,"" Lee Daniels, the creator of ""Empire,"" said in a video posted to his Instagram page on January 29. ""And no racist f*** can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up, Jussie. I'm with you.""

Smollett gave his first detailed account of what he says was a hate crime against him, and the aftermath, in an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that aired Thursday.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" Smollett said. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.""

Smollett stated that one of the attackers shouted ""this is MAGA country"" before punching him in the face. But he refuted reports that said he told police the attackers wore ""Make America Great Again"" hats.

""I never said that,"" he told ABC's Robin Roberts. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae."""

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS Chicago, which reported that “other sources corroborated that information.”

On January 22, a letter threatening Smollett was received in the mail at the Fox studio where “Empire” is filmed.

“Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CNN that the letter, received on January 22 at Cinespace Studios, where the show is filmed, prompted a response from the HAZMAT unit,” CNN reported. “Guglielmi said authorities determined the powder to be aspirin, but declined to give details on the content of the letter.”

A report from The Blast states that “the FBI is investigating who sent the letter, regardless of whether or not the threat was legitimate or part an elaborate set-up involving Smollett.”

The Blast’s sources say that the charge would be “mailing threatening communications,” and that “legally, if reports are true and somehow the letter sent is a part of some hoax or setup, whoever is responsible can be arrested.”

This latest development comes after CBS News Chicago reported over the weekend that “sources” indicated that “at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request” and “the brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return.”

CBS Chicago spoke with the two brothers — Ola and Abel Osundairo — who said in a joint statement: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

TMZ noted that law enforcement sources were suspicious of Smollett’s claims:

The sources say there were red flags from the get-go. Cops were extremely suspicious when Jussie took them out to the area where he said he was attacked and pointed to an obscure camera saying how happy he was that the attack was on video. Turns out the camera was pointing in the wrong direction. Cops thought it was weird he knew the location of that camera. And, there’s this. We’re told investigators didn’t believe the 2 alleged attackers screamed, “This is MAGA country,” because, “Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire.'”

Chicago police have indicated that they want to question Smollett following all the latest developments, but the actor does not appear to be willing to do so.

“Statement from #Smollett crisis team: ‘There are no plans for #JussieSmollett to meet w/ Chicago police 2day. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.

There is no doubt that the First Amendment has been under attack for a while in this country. Comedy, which has always been the one place where anything can be said, has also suffered these past couples of years. We as a nation have been suffering for it.

Thankfully, there is one man who still does not give a flying you-know-what about what the conventional thought of the day in the college, media P.C. culture.

That man is Dave Chappelle.

In a standup appearance, last Thursday on Valentine’s Day in Charlotte, North Carolina, the star of the Comedy Central hit “The Chappelle Show” proceded to talk about and destroy some of the hot topics of the day.

According to LOGO…

He informed the crowd of breaking news, which was inaccessible to those of us in attendance, as he had employed the use of Yondr to lock up people’s phones: Smollett had, in Chappelle’s words, faked the attack against him to stay on Empire. Chappelle joked that it made him so mad he wanted to break a dollhouse over the star’s head, referencing one of the jokes that brought criticism to Hart. He questioned a number of elements of Smollett’s story, saying he was skeptical from the beginning, despite wanting to believe him. Even Scooby-Doo, he joked, would have questioned the veracity of the actor and singer’s account.

He was just getting warmed up.

He questioned everything about Jussie’s story, clearly showing that he had been questioning this for a while and was compiling some jokes on this.

In his routine, he noted that…

* Jussie wouldn’t be going to Subway late at night and could hire people to do that for him in the cold January night.

* Why anyone would be walking around Chicago at 2 a.m. with a noose and why Smollett had kept the noose around his neck while he waited for the police to arrive.

Here is where free speech should be valued and why comics like Dave Chappelle are invaluable even if you don’t agree with his world view.

He repeatedly expressed his anger that, in his belief, Smollett had lied about the attack, saying it would hurt the credibility of real victims of anti-gay and racist violence, and joked that he hoped “the gays” take the brunt of the blow back.

That we have people advocating for believing any story even if it does not sound true or is not backed up by facts is DAMAGING real victims of actual discrimination and violence. This is the message that will get lost in the march to find the truth of what happened back in late January with Smollett. Also, I’m sure Dave will be heavily criticized for joking that he hopes “the gays” take the brunt of the blowback. This is what great comedians excel at, mixing humor with biting social commentary.

The whole Alexander Ocasio-Cortez wing of the socialist movement is so devoid of any humor this will infuriate them and I hope they respond. They will demand apologies and try to destroy the First Amendment and comedy along with it and they won’t be able to match the sheer wit of Chappelle and others.

Mostly because the AOC wing is just flat out wrong on a lot of their world view.

Who could have imagined when this all started it would take the guy who created the blind African American KKK member, Clayton Bigsby (Dave Chapelle as Bigsby pictured above) to lead the way to defend free speech and to laugh. I’m glad he did.

One last thing that will just drive the progressives bonkers.

He closed out the set with this poke in the eye to the feelings over facts crowd…

“If I ever get in trouble for the things I say, I’ll say it right now: I’m going to apologize. Just know, I’m not sorry.”

Game. Set. Match.

Long live Dave Chapelle.

Jussie Smollett allegedly rehearsed his January Chicago attack days before the incident, according to law enforcement sources.

Per TMZ on Monday, Abel and Ola Osundairo — who were allegedly paid by the Empire star to orchestrate the attack, according to insiders via CNN — told cops they got in a car with the thespian to scout a location.

Allegedly, they chose an area outside Smollett’s apartment because he believed a camera would capture the action.

The Nigerian brothers are also said to claim Jussie wanted the scene to be a “physical thing,” but not to the point of him getting seriously injured.

On the night in question, Abel and Ola said they showed up, but were extremely nervous, and even believed they might have been identified when a car drove by.

Allegedly, they performed as they did in the rehearsal, and screamed out that they knew Jussie was from the Fox show, in addition to shouting out racist and homophobic insults.

While they “made contact with Jussie’s face,” their force was “weak.” Afterward, the brothers were confused by the actor’s alleged bruises as they never intended to cause him significant harm.

According to the publication on Sunday, when cops arrived at the alleged incident, Smollett took them to the area, and pointed at the camera, claiming he was glad the “attack” was recorded. Allegedly, the camera was pointed in the wrong direction, and did not capture the scene.

Meanwhile, according to law enforcement sources via TMZ, there is a 50/50 chance the actor’s Grand Jury hearing — for allegedly filing a false police report — will not happen on Tuesday, and may be delayed for several days.

Reportedly, the Osundairo brothers will testify voluntarily, though they have not been subpoenaed, nor have they received immunity from prosecution. They also reportedly did not file a false police report, nor did they give false information to the cops.

Apparently, authorities want to make sure they have all the records necessary for the jury to reach a conclusion on whether or not to indict the actor.

Though their investigation has “shifted,” the Chicago Police Department have not officially declared Smollett a suspect.

Jussie Smollett rehearsed the ""attack"" against him days before the incident and it was all staged for the camera, this according to what the 2 brothers told cops.

Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, Abel and Ola Osundairo told cops they got in a car with Jussie and scouted a location, settling on the one right outside the actor's apartment. The brothers said Jussie chose the spot because he believed a camera would have captured the action.

Our sources say the brothers told police Jussie said he wanted to make it a ""physical thing,"" but not to the point he'd be seriously injured.

On the night Jussie says he was attacked, the brothers claim they showed up at the scene but were extremely nervous because, just as they played out the scene, a car drove by and they were worried they'd be ID'd.

Our sources say the brothers performed per the rehearsal -- they screamed out they recognized Jussie from ""Empire"" and then hurled the racist n-word and the homophobic f-word.

The brothers told cops they ""made contact with Jussie's face"" but it was ""weak."" They said they didn't know how he suffered the bruises but the staged fight was not designed to injure him.

Now, with some unnamed police claiming the actor-singer staged the incident, Smollett remains steadfast in his depiction of events and claims he was indeed the victim of a hate crime.

The alleged hate crime took place around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 29, in Chicago, where Jussie Smollett lives while filming Empire. According to Smollett, two men wearing ski masks approached him, placed a noose around his neck, doused him in bleach and shouted “This is MAGA country.”

The actor-singer stood by his story when he sat down for an interview with Good Morning America host Robin Roberts, offering up all the details of a racist, homophobic attack against him and remarking, “I just want them to find them” about the Chicago Police locating the attackers.

With only one heavily circulated image of the two alleged attackers available to police (above), things began to seem “fishy” last week when the two men in the photo were indeed found, questioned and later arrested — “fishy” because the two men are brothers of Nigerian descent, not Trump supporters and are acquaintances of Jussie Smollett, with at least one of them having appeared as an extra on Empire.

The brothers were arrested on Wednesday, Feb. 13, and released without charges on Friday, Feb. 15, after investigators cited the discovery of new evidence.

Only days ago the Chicago Police said of the Jussie Smollett case that allegations of the actor having staged the attack were “inaccurate.” But the public outcry against Smollett has been swift, due to many outlets reporting that “police sources” with knowledge of the investigation are claiming the Chicago Police believe the actor-singer paid the two brothers to orchestrate the assault.

But the Chicago Police detectives working on the Smollett case — of which there are reportedly 12 — have not confirmed that complete turn of events. Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago PD, tweeted on Feb. 15, “Case Update: Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

He followed that up on Feb. 17 with this: “While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

Friday, Feb. 15 also saw release of a statement on behalf of the actor-singer, now being represented by defense attorney Michael Monico. The statement reads:

As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

With the investigation into the alleged attack against Jussie Smollett still pending, it’s unlikely we will hear more from the Chicago Police before detectives have a strong sense of what happened in those early hours of Jan. 29.

We will continue to update our reporting on the Jussie Smollett case as new information becomes available.

After news broke in January, Harris called it “an attempted modern day lynching”:

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

When asked about her tweet on the campaign trail with the new reports, Harris said “the facts are still unfolding.”

“Okay. So I will say this about that. I think the facts are still unfolding. I’m very concerned about it obviously,” she said.

Harris was also asked about the Smollett case on WMUR in New Hampshire earlier Monday, and gave a similar response.

After the weekend reports, Smollett’s lawyers said he will not be meeting with Chicago police on Monday, despite renewed requests from the department to re-interview him.

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” they said . “Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

UPDATE –– 07:12 pm ET

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel responded to Harris’ new statement, asking “why is she giggling about it”:

Reporter Andy Ngo started a list on Twitter over the weekend and continued it this morning:

What’s really amazing about this long list is that it’s still not complete. Remember the Air Force Academy prep school where racist graffiti was found? That was big news when it happened. That incident also turned out to be a hoax. The person responsible was one of the black students who was supposedly targeted by the graffiti.

How about the Odessa, Texas waiter who claimed someone had written “We don’t Tip Terrorist” in lieu of a tip on a $108 tab. It later turned out he wrote the note himself.

There was also a fake anti-Muslim hate crime last January in Canada. An 11-year-old girl in Toronto claimed someone had cut off her hijab as she walked to school. The attack was quickly condemned by the Mayor and the Prime Minister. Police eventually revealed it never happened. A very similar hoax took place in Virginia a few months later. This time the girl was 13-years-old and claimed someone had grabbed her, threatened her with a knife and ripped off her hijab. Police concluded that never happened either.

And who can forget the Whole Foods hoax? A pastor in Austin claimed Whole Foods had written a gay slur on his cake. He filed a lawsuit and the media was all over the story. Everything changed when Whole Foods revealed they had the whole thing on video. Suddenly the pastor apologized and admitted the company “did nothing wrong.”

Let’s wrap this up with the three black students at SUNY in Albany who claimed they’d been victims of a hate crime by white people during a ride on a bus in January 2016. The University President published a letter expressing his concern over the attack. A rally was held on campus which drew as many as 300 people to support the victims. Even Hillary Clinton tweeted about the incident. After reviewing video from the bus, police concluded the three young women were not victims of a hate crime but had instead instigated a racial incident against a white student on the bus (who they referred to as a “white b*tch).

Obviously, I’m not saying that there aren’t real hate crimes taking place out there. But there’s no doubt that in the last three years we’ve seen quite a few high-profile hoaxes which, at the time they happened, were embraced by people on the left as a sign that a climate of hate was sweeping the nation. Some people, and maybe Jussie Smollett is one of them, seem so eager to prove their political opponents are villains they’ll stage a hoax to prove it. That’s a shame because a) they are smearing a lot of innocent people and b) they make it harder on the next person who reports a real hate crime.

Update: I didn’t include it above but the Covington Catholic story pretty much fits this list too. Nathan Phillips’ account of what happened was that this was a racist mob about to enact a hate crime. either against him or the Black Hebrew Israelites. In fact, most of what he said about the incident was a lie. His group and the Black Hebrews were the aggressors, not the other way around."

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards. Other sources corroborated that information.

The blockbuster revelation into at least part of Smollett’s potential motive comes two days after CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar reported Smollett and two brothers — Ola and Abel Osundairo — staged the attack on Jan. 29 in Streeterville.

De Mar spoke on the phone exclusively with the Osundairo brothers Monday afternoon. In a joint statement, they said: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Smollett received a letter containing a white powder Jan. 22. The letter was mailed to Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, where the show “Empire” is filmed. The letter prompted a HAZMAT response. CPD says the “white substance” was later determined to be aspirin.

The note was crafted with letters apparently cut out from magazines to form words. The pieced-together message contained racial and homophobic threats directed at Smollett. A magazine is one of the pieces of evidence retrieved from the brother’s home last week during a search conducted by CPD. Investigators also recovered a book of stamps.

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source with knowledge told CBS2 Chicago Monday, following reports that the investigation into his alleged attack had “shifted.” (RELATED: Chicago Police Say ‘Empire’ Actor Refuses To Turn Over Phone Records)

The “Empire” actor received a letter on Jan. 22 that contained a white powder substance. It was sent to the Chicago’s Cinespace Studios. HAZMAT was called out and the substance was letter identified to be aspirin. The note reportedly contained letters that were cut from magazines to form words. A magazine and book of stamps were just a few of the items retrieved last week from the home of two brothers, who were arrested.

It comes on the heels of a report that the 36-year-old actor would not be meeting with law enforcement for a “follow-up interview” Monday, following the arrest and release of the two potential suspects in connection with the case. They reportedly are acquaintances of Smollett.

A FOX reporter also tweeted that Smollett has hired a “Chicago based crisis management consultant.”

“#JussieSmollett lawyers have hired #Chicago based crisis management consultant Anne Kavanagh. I’m told she was also hired by former @Chicago_Police officer Jason Van Dyke who killed Laquan McDonald,” Rafer Weigel wrote.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” a statement from the two men—the Osundairo brothers—shared with the outlet.

“In due course all the facts will reveal themselves and at the end of the day my clients are honest and credible,” the brothers’ attorney Gloria Schmidt shared.

As previously reported, two unnamed law enforcement sources shared Saturday with CNN that investigators believe Smollett may have paid the two brothers to stage the attack.

Smollett’s attorney hit back at reports Saturday that the attack had been a hoax.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement.

Smollett claimed he was attacked near his Chicago home on Jan. 29th. He told police he was attacked by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, along with a reference to “MAGA” (Make America Great Again). They also reportedly put a rope around his neck and threw a bleach-like chemical on him."

The liberal journalist then attempted to blame the “atmosphere of menace” supposedly created by the President to explain why so many in the media, including himself, believed the story.

“Well, I don’t know what to make of all this. Because when the news came out, a lot of people, myself included, were horrified,” Capehart began. He then justified the rush to judgement by arguing that Smollett’s account “fit in with a narrative” about the Trump era:

Just the circumstances and the way he told the story, and what he said happened to him sort of fit in with a narrative – not a narrative, but a reality for a lot of people in this country since President Trump was inaugurated. That there is an atmosphere of menace and an atmosphere of hate around the country that made it possible for people to either readily believe or want to believe Jussie Smollett.

Capehart used identical language during a February 1 appearance on NPR’s 1A talk show to discuss the alleged attack and lecture the administration: “The fact that it [was] repeatedly said ‘This is MAGA country’ adds to sort of the atmosphere of menace that African Americans in particular and people of color in general have felt since the advent of the Trump administration, given the rhetoric from the campaign and out of the administration.”

On MSNBC on Monday, Capehart admitted that “there were people who immediately thought something was fishy.” He certainly wasn’t one of them, but cited how his “colleague at The Washington Post, Nana Efua Mumford wrote a piece where she likened his retelling of the story to an episode of Empire, it was so over the top.”

Despite that skepticism, Mumford told readers how much she wished to be wrong and for the story to be true. Anchor Hallie Jackson highlighted a line from the article: “If Smollett’s story is found to be untrue, it will cause irreparable damage to the communities most affected. The incident would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists. It would be the very embodiment of ‘fake news.’”

Capehart followed up: “And that here, is the bigger issue. There is real pain in this country, there is real fear in this country. And if it turns out that Smollett did indeed – orchestrated this attack, paid the attackers, then he’s done infinitely more damage to the African-American community, people of color....The LGBTQ community.”

The Post writer angrily concluded: “All for what? Reportedly to save his own role on the show? Was it worth it? That’s a question I would like to ask Jussie Smollett if, indeed, it’s proven that he orchestrated this attack.”

It’s interesting that media anger about the Smollett case seems to be less about a false story being reported as fact, but more that the “narrative” advanced by the claim has been damaged.

Smollett had been charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly hiring two men to attack him in what was described as a staged attack near his Streeterville home in January.

Smollett previously told police he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 when two men walked up to him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him in the face, poured a substance — possibly bleach — on him and put a “thin, light rope” around his neck. The incident was being investigated as a hate crime.

The actor denied allegations that the attack was staged in an interview on “Good Morning America” with anchor Robin Roberts, and said the attacks on his credibility have been hard to take. He called accusations that he was lying “ridiculous.”

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said in an emailed statement that the attorneys “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett, who is Jewish, black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men last month shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country,” a reference to US President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away, as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two Nigerian brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police said they had requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers said the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

On Sunday, two law enforcement officials told CNN that police believe Smollett may have paid the actors to assault him.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the actor’s attorneys said.

The law enforcement sources told CNN that records showed the two men arrested and subsequently released had purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Police earlier said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from US Senator Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California, on February 2, saying that he went ahead with the show because he could not let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored downtown Chicago area, but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

Professor Jacobson wrote about how the media has resorted to using the same script against MAGA as they did to the Tea Party back in 2008. No matter the facts, one just has to scream TRUMP or MAGA and the media jumps all over it. When facts come out, the media either doubles down or tries to find a way to spin it to push their narrative that everyone on the right is a racist.

The stories that Ngo tweeted about disappeared into the background once the truth came out. If it does match the narrative the MSM wants to portray, they simply bury it on the back pages.

Ola and Abel Osundairo went from persons of interest in the case to potential suspects to being released without charges.

CBS Chicago spoke with the Osundairo brothers Monday afternoon. In a joint statement, they said: ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was assaulted on January 29 by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs. He told police they shouted ""This is MAGA country!""

Police said the Osundairo brothers were captured on surveillance video at the time that Smollett said he was attacked. Ola Osundairo is connected to Smollett through the hit show ""Empire"" where he played a prisoner in season two.

Both brothers apparently left Chicago on the day of the alleged attack and were detained when they returned Wednesday. Chicago detectives tore through their apartment looking for clues, and an evidence log shows they found ropes, masks and bleach. They were released Friday night without charges.

A source close to the investigation told CBS News that the brothers told detectives Smollett paid them to participate in the attack. The brothers said they bought rope that was found around Smollett's neck at a nearby hardware store. A raid of their home turned up ropes, masks and bleach.

The Chicago Police Department released a statement Saturday night saying information from the brothers had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview,"" the statement read.

Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement late Saturday saying Smollett was ""angered and devastated"" by reports that he knew the people associated with the alleged attack.

TMZ's reporting that what was initially interpreted as a racist, homophobic hate crime was staged for cameras and that two brothers who carried out the alleged assault, Abel and Ola Osundairo, revealed this information to police.

The Osundairos claimed to have taken a drive with Smollett beforehand to scout a location, and ultimately chose an area outside the actor/singer’s apartment building. They said Smollett picked the spot because he thought a camera would record the incident.

TMZ’s sources said police were also told Smollett wanted to make it a “physical thing,” but not to go so far that he’d be badly injured. On the night of the event, the brothers say they showed up at the spot but were nervous: just as they started to act out the plan, a car drove by and they feared they would be identified.

TMZ shares that Osundairos performed per Smollett’s wishes, screaming out that they knew Smollett from Empire, while calling him racist and homophobic names. The men told police they “made contact with Jussie's face” but it was “weak.” They said they don’t know how he became so bruised, but that the fight wasn’t planned to hurt him.

Smollett was set to meet with the police, but on Monday, news emerged that he wouldn’t. Earlier, it was divulged that local authorities wanted to speak with the Empire star again in connection with “new evidence.""

Following the brothers’ arrest on Wednesday, Feb. 13, the police department supposedly discovered the aforementioned new evidence that allowed for their release on Friday. Two police sources reportedly told CNN Smollett may have paid the two brothers.

There has been a lot of back and forth in this case. On Feb. 14, it was revealed that police were denying reports that said Smollett’s attack was orchestrated, with Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi denying reports saying the Chicago police believe the attack against Smollett was staged.

Guglielmi made the statement on Twitter, following ABC 7’s report, which cited sources claiming the attack was set up. Sources also alleged that Smollett was in the process of being written off Empire."

JUSSIE SMOLLETT – CELEBRITIES BAFFLED BY “SHIFT” IN CASE

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The focus by Chicago police on the Jussie Smollett case isn’t the only thing that has “shifted” the past day or two. Also shifting: support from fellow celebrities for the “Empire” actor. From the time the story broke, numerous musicians, actors and others in Hollywood expressed support for Smollett — and distain for the political climate that seemed to foster an attack on an openly gay black man by people who uttered racist and anti-gay slurs. Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied to his side right away — and spoke of the incident as an example of how intolerance can lead to violence. But most of those voices have fallen silent as talk increases that Smollett may have made up the story. Meanwhile conservative pundits have said celebrities and the news media were too quick to believe a story that indicated supporters of President Donald Trump are racist and homophobic.

BOX OFFICE

LOS ANGELES (AP) — It’s Presidents Day. But for the movie industry, there’s little to celebrate — unless someone in Hollywood scores a deal on a new car or furniture. This holiday weekend posted its lowest box office figures in nearly 20 years. And this, despite three major debuts hitting the multiplexes. The top film is the sci-fi fantasy “Alita: Battle Angel,” but even that victory is hollow. It took in an estimated $27.8 billion — but it reportedly cost $170 million to make. Number two is last week’s top movie, “The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part,” followed by “Isn’t It Romantic,” ”What Men Want” and “Happy Death Day 2U.”

OSCAR BACKLASH LEADS TO REVERSAL

UNDATED (AP) — The goofs by the motion picture academy in the run-up to this year’s Oscars may make people long for the days when the only thing the awards show had to worry about was goofing up the best picture winner. This year has seen a series of blunders, like the move to not have all the categories shown in the live telecast. That decision has now been scrapped, meaning all 24 categories will be live. Also, this year’s show won’t have a host, after the gig was offered to — then rejected by — Kevin Hart after a public outcry about past jokes and tweets about gays. And early in the process, the Oscars walked back a decision that would have limited the number of tunes nominated for best original song that would be performed during the telecast.

“BLACK PANTHER” COSTUME DESIGNER SPEAKS OF INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Usually, only friends, families and colleagues of those nominated for the costume design category at the Oscars will care about the results. But Ruth E. Carter says she hopes her Oscar nod will be seen as a way to open doors for others to follow in her path. Carter is the first African American to win for costume design. She’s nominated for “Black Panther.” Despite what she calls “very stiff competition,” Carter says she thinks she has a good chance at winning.

WAX STATUE OF DIDDY IS VANDALIZED

NEW YORK (AP) — Police say someone attacked a statue of Sean “Diddy” Combs at Madame Tussauds wax museum in New York, shoving the rap impresario’s likeness so forcefully it lost its head. Investigators were continuing Monday to look for a suspect in the strange episode Saturday night. Police say a man entered the museum near Times Square around 8:45 p.m., went to the statue and knocked it to the ground. The head fell off as the figure toppled. Madame Tussauds New York says artists will fix the damage as quickly as possible to get the figure back to the museum’s A-List Party Room. General Manager Tom Middleton notes that Madame Tussauds doesn’t rope off its statues so “guests can interact respectfully” with them. Combs attended his statue’s unveiling in 2009.

NASHVILLE (AP) — William Shatner is the latest artist to make a debut appearance at the Grand Ole Opry. And yes, you heard that right. The “Star Trek” star rolled out some new tunes during his first-time performance in Nashville. And he says his training as an actor has helped him shape his musical sound. He says acting makes him use words in a particular rhythm — and he tries to use that skill when he sings.

MANHOLE FIRES FORCE TheatreS TO EVACUATE

NEW YORK (AP) — As the say on Broadway, the show must go on. But not when the fire department says otherwise. Manhole fires in midtown Manhattan on Saturday forced the evacuation of a theatre complex where performances of plays including “Jersey Boys” and “Avenue Q” were under way. No injuries were reported. Three other shows were cancelled for the night: “The Play That Goes Wrong,” ”Puffs” and “A Spirited History of Drinking.” The cause of the manhole fires isn’t known.

The Prince of Wales raised three cheers at the Royal Albert Hall when he wished his mother a happy 92nd birthday as a star-studded celebration came to a close.

Addressing the Queen, he first referred to her as 'Your Majesty', before switching to the more familiar 'Mummy', prompting the monarch to roll her eyes and smile.

They appeared on stage at the conclusion of the evening, flanked by performers on an evening which saw a spectacular line-up of singers including Sting and Shaggy, Tom Jones and Kylie Minogue.

'This organisation, in your name, will provide a platform for those working to make a difference in their communities across 53 countries. Happy Birthday Your Majesty.'

Harry paid tribute to his mother and spoke about the charity work of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust of which he was recently appointed president.

The Queen celebrates two birthdays every year: Her actual birthday on April 21, which she usually marks privately with her family, and her 'official birthday' in the summer. It usually falls on the second Saturday in June, when she joins the Trooping the Color military parade in central London.

Earlier in the day, honorary gun salutes were staged in Hyde Park, the Tower of London and in Windsor to mark the occasion."

McCabe and 60 Minutes Avoid Discussing Why Russia Factored in Comey’s Firing (National Review)

Andrew McCabe is a good witness and he made a favorable impression, at least on me, in his 60 Minutes interview with Scott Pelley. Pelley and his editors did a great job highlighting McCabe’s down-to-earth likability. Unlike Jim Comey, a career prosecutor and corporate lawyer before he became FBI director, former deputy director McCabe is a career agent; his relation of events smacks of the Bureau’s “just the facts, ma’am” ethos. And McCabe’s account of Trump telling him to ask his wife what it was like to be a “loser” (after she lost a Virginia state senate race) is devastating, precisely because it sounds just like something Trump would say.

Jussie Smollett, 36, reported to police on Jan. 29 that two men beat him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck while he walked downtown in the third-largest American city.



The announced change in direction came two days after police said that the two ""potential suspects"" in the attack had been released without charge and as US media outlets reported that the attack may have been staged.



""The information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.



""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview,"" he added.



Multiple US media outlets reported the two men are brothers who were arrested at Chicago's O'Hare airport upon their return from a trip to Nigeria.



At least one of the men reportedly worked on ""Empire,"" a TV series about the fortunes of a hip-hop mogul and his family battling over control of a multi-million-dollar music company.



In an emotional interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" broadcast Thursday, Smollett gave details of the purported attack and said he was angry at doubts about its veracity.

The 36-year-old actor required hospital treatment after a suspected racist and homophobic attack in Chicago last month and the two men were arrested during the week but released without charge after questioning

19 February 2019

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote on Twitter: ""Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.""



The attorney for the brothers told CBS Chicago that his clients know Smollett and that they sometimes work out at the same gym. He denied his clients were responsible for the attack.



Meanwhile, defence attorney Michael Monico has confirmed to Variety that he is now representing Smollett.



Jussie has told police he was attacked on January 29 by two men, who he has accused of launching a racist and homophobic attack on him.



He also discussed the incident on 'Good Morning America', saying it had all happened ""so fast"" while he was out getting food.



He recalled: ""I went to the Subway, got my order. During that time I texted my manager, thinking that he was still in Australia ... I said, 'Call me when you can.' He called me immediately and while he was on the phone, I heard as I was crossing the intersection, 'Empire!' And I don't answer to 'Empire', my name ain't 'Empire'.



""And I didn't answer, I kept walking, and then I heard, ""f***ing 'Empire' n****r.' So I turned around and I said, 'What the f**k did you just say to me?' And I see the attacker, masked, and he said, 'This MAGA country, n****r,' and he punched me right in the face. So I punched his ass back and then we started tussling.



""There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back and then it just stopped and they ran off.



""It happened so fast. It felt like minutes but it was probably 30 seconds.""

Robin Roberts: The Good Morning America host on Monday defended her interview with Smollett last week, in which he criticized his doubters. “When I sat down with Jussie it was Tuesday night in Chicago, at the time to give his first account, publicly give his first account of what he said happened,” Roberts said, per Fox News. “At that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative.""

Jussie Smollett auditioned for a role in a play that shares eerie similarities to his alleged attack — and he may have used Instagram to tip off the brothers to his whereabouts the night of the beat-down, according to a report on Monday.

In the hours before the violent Jan. 29 assault in Chicago, the “Empire” star was in New York City for a day of readings for a possible revival of “Take Me Out,” sources told the Daily Mail.

The Tony-winning production follows a biracial baseball player who is attacked by a pitcher — and called a “n—-r” and “f—-t” — after coming out. The characters compete on a team called the New York Empires.

Smollett was among actors, including Zachary Quinto, to perform two readings that day, one in the morning and another in the afternoon.

Afterward, he popped to La Guardia Airport to fly back to Chicago to film the final episodes of the fourth season of “Empire.”

But when the flight got delayed, Smollett began posting Instagram stories — which cops now believe were meant for brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo to see ahead of the attack, a source told the Mail.

One story had the airport tagged as a location and the caption, “Guess who is still on this [motherf–king] runway after two hours?”

Another two hours later said “Hey it’s me again … think i took off yet? Naaaaah…”

Smollett allegedly made a third post when the plane finally took off.

The Osundairos told cops that the attack was supposed to happen earlier than Jan. 29, CBS Chicago reported on Sunday."

The update comes amid the investigation into Smollett’s alleged January attack.

CBS News reported on Saturday that they have sources close to the investigation who claim that two men arrested in the case last week allege Smollett knows them and further claim the actor “paid them to participate in the alleged attack” — which Smollett has vehemently denied through his lawyers.

On Friday, Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Communications Officer for Chicago Police, confirmed on Twitter that the men had been released without charges, noting that “detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

The letter apparently contained white powder and had “MAGA” written on the outside of it, along with racial and homophobic slurs.

Chicago police say HAZMAT responded to the letter and determined the white powder to be aspirin. The letter is now in the hands of the FBI.

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” one source told CBS Chicago’s Brad Edwards, as the other sources reportedly corroborated.

Ola and Abel Osundairo, the two Nigerian brothers who were paid $3,500 to stage an attack against Smollett while pretending to be Trump supporters, said they did not have an ideological motive for participating.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” they told CBS’s Charlie De Mar.

The Empire star reportedly paid for the rope that the brothers used to attack him, and rehearsed the attack together with him days before carrying it out, according to the sources. One brother allegedly held the rope and poured bleach as the other wore a Make America Great Again hat and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at Smollett.

The Chicago Police Department refused to corroborate this information in a text message to Edwards, saying no more information can be confirmed until the cops have spoken with Smollett himself. They made the following statement:

We are not doing any interviews or making any official statements until we can corroborate some information that was shared with police. Until we meet with the Empire cast member, we are not able to confirm, deny or comment on any of the information that was released unofficially. When this investigation is over, we will have a detailed accounting of the case While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include additional investigation and speaking to the individual who reported the incident.

Smollett’s lawyers say he does not plan to meet with Chicago police, and any communication from here on out will be through his lawyers.

According to TMZ, Abel and Ola Osundairo—who were persons of interest in the case, but have since reportedly stated that Smollett paid them to be involved—will voluntarily go before the grand jury and testify regarding their involvement.

The brothers have not been subpoenaed and are not charged with any crime, as they are not said to have lied to the police or committed any actual crime since is was Smollett who communicated with police.

Previously, police brought the brothers in for questioning, and allegedly discovered evidence that changed the details of the case. Speculation at this time is that Smollett may have fabricated the attack and hired the Osundairo brothers to help.

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorneys for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives Monday for a follow-up interview about his reported assault. Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT – CELEBRITIES BAFFLED BY “SHIFT” IN CASE

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The focus by Chicago police on the Jussie Smollett case isn’t the only thing that has “shifted” the past day or two. Also shifting: support from fellow celebrities for the “Empire” actor. From the time the story broke, numerous musicians, actors and others in Hollywood expressed support for Smollett — and distain for the political climate that seemed to foster an attack on an openly gay black man by people who uttered racist and anti-gay slurs. Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied to his side right away — and spoke of the incident as an example of how intolerance can lead to violence. But most of those voices have fallen silent as talk increases that Smollett may have made up the story. Meanwhile conservative pundits have said celebrities and the news media were too quick to believe a story that indicated supporters of President Donald Trump are racist and homophobic.

BOX OFFICE

LOS ANGELES (AP) — It’s Presidents Day. But for the movie industry, there’s little to celebrate — unless someone in Hollywood scores a deal on a new car or furniture. This holiday weekend posted its lowest box office figures in nearly 20 years. And this, despite three major debuts hitting the multiplexes. The top film is the sci-fi fantasy “Alita: Battle Angel,” but even that victory is hollow. It took in an estimated $27.8 billion — but it reportedly cost $170 million to make. Number two is last week’s top movie, “The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part,” followed by “Isn’t It Romantic,” ”What Men Want” and “Happy Death Day 2U.”

OSCAR BACKLASH LEADS TO REVERSAL

UNDATED (AP) — The goofs by the motion picture academy in the run-up to this year’s Oscars may make people long for the days when the only thing the awards show had to worry about was goofing up the best picture winner. This year has seen a series of blunders, like the move to not have all the categories shown in the live telecast. That decision has now been scrapped, meaning all 24 categories will be live. Also, this year’s show won’t have a host, after the gig was offered to — then rejected by — Kevin Hart after a public outcry about past jokes and tweets about gays. And early in the process, the Oscars walked back a decision that would have limited the number of tunes nominated for best original song that would be performed during the telecast.

“BLACK PANTHER” COSTUME DESIGNER SPEAKS OF INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Usually, only friends, families and colleagues of those nominated for the costume design category at the Oscars will care about the results. But Ruth E. Carter says she hopes her Oscar nod will be seen as a way to open doors for others to follow in her path. Carter is the first African American to win for costume design. She’s nominated for “Black Panther.” Despite what she calls “very stiff competition,” Carter says she thinks she has a good chance at winning.

WAX STATUE OF DIDDY IS VANDALIZED

NEW YORK (AP) — Police say someone attacked a statue of Sean “Diddy” Combs at Madame Tussauds wax museum in New York, shoving the rap impresario’s likeness so forcefully it lost its head. Investigators were continuing Monday to look for a suspect in the strange episode Saturday night. Police say a man entered the museum near Times Square around 8:45 p.m., went to the statue and knocked it to the ground. The head fell off as the figure toppled. Madame Tussauds New York says artists will fix the damage as quickly as possible to get the figure back to the museum’s A-List Party Room. General Manager Tom Middleton notes that Madame Tussauds doesn’t rope off its statues so “guests can interact respectfully” with them. Combs attended his statue’s unveiling in 2009.

JULIA ROBERTS – AWARD

ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) — Julia Roberts is year’s winner of the George Eastman Award. She’s been named to receive the honour from the George Eastman Museum in Rochester, New York.

Roberts is known for her work in “Pretty Woman” and “Steel Magnolias.” Past recipients include Lauren Bacall, Gary Cooper and Meryl Streep. The award will be presented on May 2.

WILLIAM SHATNER SINGS AT GRAND OLD OPRY

NASHVILLE (AP) — William Shatner is the latest artist to make a debut appearance at the Grand Ole Opry. And yes, you heard that right. The “Star Trek” star rolled out some new tunes during his first-time performance in Nashville. And he says his training as an actor has helped him shape his musical sound. He says acting makes him use words in a particular rhythm — and he tries to use that skill when he sings.

MANHOLE FIRES FORCE TheatreS TO EVACUATE

NEW YORK (AP) — As the say on Broadway, the show must go on. But not when the fire department says otherwise. Manhole fires in midtown Manhattan on Saturday forced the evacuation of a theatre complex where performances of plays including “Jersey Boys” and “Avenue Q” were under way. No injuries were reported. Three other shows were cancelled for the night: “The Play That Goes Wrong,” ”Puffs” and “A Spirited History of Drinking.” The cause of the manhole fires isn’t known.

California Sen. Kamala Harris says she won’t comment again on the investigation into a reported attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett until an investigation is completed.

Speaking to reporters in Concord, New Hampshire, on Monday during her first 2020 presidential campaign trip here, Harris says that “the facts are still unfolding” and that while she is “very concerned” about Smollett’s initial allegation and that it should be taken seriously, “there should be an investigation.”

She says, “I think that once the investigation is concluded, then we should all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of that investigation.”

Harris previously tweeted that the alleged attack was “an attempted modern day lynching.”

She will hold a town hall later Monday in Portsmouth, her first of the 2020 cycle.

3:15 p.m.

Sen. Kamala Harris is letting voters in New Hampshire know that she does not consider herself a democratic socialist.

On Monday, the California Democrat stopped by The Common Man restaurant in Concord, greeting patrons and having lunch with Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster. Soon after, she went to Gibson’s Bookstore and took questions from shoppers, telling the group: “I plan on competing in New Hampshire. I plan on spending a lot of time here.”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who calls himself a “democratic socialist” won a commanding victory in New Hampshire in 2016. Asked whether she’d have to lean that way in order to compete here, she said she would not.

She says, “The people of New Hampshire will tell me what’s required to compete in New Hampshire, but I will tell you I am not a democratic socialist.”

8 a.m.

Several Democratic presidential candidates are closing out the long holiday weekend by campaigning across states key to securing their party’s nomination.

On Presidents Day, much of the attention turned to New Hampshire, home to the first presidential primary. Three candidates, Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, were making their first visits to the state since launching their 2020 presidential bids.

Booker has been in the state for a few days and will wrap up his trip with a house party in Nashua. House parties are a staple of campaigning in the state.

Harris planned an afternoon town hall in Portsmouth and will participate in the Politics & Eggs breakfast on Tuesday.

Klobuchar will hold a meet-and-greet in Goffstown on Monday before a CNN town hall.

Meanwhile, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York was back in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state, with plans to meet voters in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City.

Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who also is running for president, was campaigning in Iowa as well.

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorneys for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives Monday for a follow-up interview about his reported assault. Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT – CELEBRITIES BAFFLED BY “SHIFT” IN CASE

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The focus by Chicago police on the Jussie Smollett case isn’t the only thing that has “shifted” the past day or two. Also shifting: support from fellow celebrities for the “Empire” actor. From the time the story broke, numerous musicians, actors and others in Hollywood expressed support for Smollett — and distain for the political climate that seemed to foster an attack on an openly gay black man by people who uttered racist and anti-gay slurs. Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied to his side right away — and spoke of the incident as an example of how intolerance can lead to violence. But most of those voices have fallen silent as talk increases that Smollett may have made up the story. Meanwhile conservative pundits have said celebrities and the news media were too quick to believe a story that indicated supporters of President Donald Trump are racist and homophobic.

BOX OFFICE

LOS ANGELES (AP) — It’s Presidents Day. But for the movie industry, there’s little to celebrate — unless someone in Hollywood scores a deal on a new car or furniture. This holiday weekend posted its lowest box office figures in nearly 20 years. And this, despite three major debuts hitting the multiplexes. The top film is the sci-fi fantasy “Alita: Battle Angel,” but even that victory is hollow. It took in an estimated $27.8 billion — but it reportedly cost $170 million to make. Number two is last week’s top movie, “The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part,” followed by “Isn’t It Romantic,” ”What Men Want” and “Happy Death Day 2U.”

The reported shift comes after CPD interviewed two suspects who were potentially connected to the case late last week. Law enforcement have yet to receive an answer from Smollett's camp, however.

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” a spokesperson for Smollett’s attorneys, Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh, stated in an email, according to CBS 2 - Chicago. “Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

But Smollett had no problem sitting down with ABC News’ Robin Roberts for an exclusive interview in which he maintains that he was the victim of an alleged hate crime.

Here’s the ABC News interview with Smollett:

CBS 2 - Chicago also reported that the CPD is playing it safe with the Smollett case, indicating that “Smollett is not considered a suspect, detectives just want to interview him to corroborate the new information they received from the two men who were released.”

Appearing Monday night at a CNN town hall in New Hampshire, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate says her state values the outdoors as well as hunting and fishing.

She says banning assault weapons wouldn’t hurt her Uncle Dick in the deer stand, nor would background checks.

Her voice broke as she recalled the mother of a Sandy Hook school shooting victim describing how her little boy died in the arms of his school aide.

Klobuchar says, “We should join the majority of Americans and actually many gun owners in having the courage to pass common sense gun safety legislation.

Appearing Monday night at a CNN town hall in New Hampshire, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate says her state values the outdoors as well as hunting and fishing.

She says banning assault weapons wouldn’t hurt her Uncle Dick in the deer stand, nor would background checks.

Her voice broke as she recalled the mother of a Sandy Hook school shooting victim describing how her little boy died in the arms of his school aide.

Klobuchar says, “We should join the majority of Americans and actually many gun owners in having the courage to pass common sense gun safety legislation.

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar referenced the late singer Prince in saying that doctors need to change the prescribing habits of opioids in the United States.

The Democratic presidential hopeful spoke Monday night at a CNN town hall in New Hampshire. She says her state still hasn’t gotten over the 2016 death of Prince, one of Minnesota’s most famous residents. He died of an accidental fentanyl overdose.

Klobuchar says the U.S. should pay for addiction treatment by taking money from the drug companies who are selling the opioids.

She referenced a bill she has co-sponsored along with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio that would require all states getting certain federal funding to electronic prescription drug monitoring and share information across state lines.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand says it would be an “inappropriate” use of the U.S. military to intervene in Venezuela.

Visiting a popular bar near the University of Iowa campus, the New York Democrat weighing a 2020 presidential campaign is responding to President Donald Trump’s warning to Venezuela’s military. Trump said if the military continues to stand with President Nicolas Maduro’s government it “would find no safe harbor” and that “all options are open.”

Critics say Maduro’s re-election last year was fraudulent, making his second term illegal.

Gillibrand says, “We should be using diplomatic and political support for the new government and we should consider sanctions against Maduro, but military action is inappropriate in this case.”

Trump spoke Monday at a rally in Miami, as the months-long political crisis in Venezuela stretched on. The Venezuelan military has blocked the U.S. from moving tons of humanitarian aid airlifted in recent days to the Colombian border with Venezuela.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is stopping short of agreeing with fellow New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s comments celebrating Amazon’s plans to cancel building a second headquarters in the state.

A freshman House member, Ocasio-Cortez hailed the cancellation as a day “dedicated, everyday New Yorkers and their neighbors defeated Amazon’s corporate greed.”

Weighing a bid for president, Gillibrand visited Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Monday. She said she thinks Ocasio-Cortez’s point is that subsidies given to Amazon were outrageous, not that she didn’t want the jobs in New York.

Amazon faced opposition from some New York officials who were unhappy with the tax incentives the retailer was promised.

Gillibrand told reporters that taxpayers were going to be “left holding the bag” and that shows the deal was outrageous.

Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris has held her first New Hampshire town hall in snowy Portsmouth along the coast. Before the event began, Harris stood on the steps of South Church and addressed a swelling overflow crowd that had been waiting outside in the still-falling snow.

She said Monday: “It’s cold. It’s snowing. It’s beautiful to this Californian.” She promised that those who couldn’t fit inside the church would have “many opportunities” to spend time with her.

Inside, Harris fielded a dozen questions from attendees, including whether she would support an effort to change Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples Day at the federal level. (She would.) Harris didn’t mention President Donald Trump by name, but implicit in many of her responses was a rebuke of the administration and the president’s policies.

She will continue to campaign in New Hampshire on Tuesday.

California Sen. Kamala Harris says she won’t comment again on the investigation into a reported attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett until an investigation is completed.

Speaking to reporters in Concord, New Hampshire, on Monday during her first 2020 presidential campaign trip here, Harris says that “the facts are still unfolding” and that while she is “very concerned” about Smollett’s initial allegation and that it should be taken seriously, “there should be an investigation.”

She says, “I think that once the investigation is concluded, then we should all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of that investigation.”

Harris previously tweeted that the alleged attack was “an attempted modern day lynching.”

She will hold a town hall later Monday in Portsmouth, her first of the 2020 cycle.

Sen. Kamala Harris is letting voters in New Hampshire know that she does not consider herself a democratic socialist.

On Monday, the California Democrat stopped by The Common Man restaurant in Concord, greeting patrons and having lunch with Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster. Soon after, she went to Gibson’s Bookstore and took questions from shoppers, telling the group: “I plan on competing in New Hampshire. I plan on spending a lot of time here.”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who calls himself a “democratic socialist” won a commanding victory in New Hampshire in 2016. Asked whether she’d have to lean that way in order to compete here, she said she would not.

She says, “The people of New Hampshire will tell me what’s required to compete in New Hampshire, but I will tell you I am not a democratic socialist.”

Several Democratic presidential candidates are closing out the long holiday weekend by campaigning across states key to securing their party’s nomination.

On Presidents Day, much of the attention turned to New Hampshire, home to the first presidential primary. Three candidates, Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, were making their first visits to the state since launching their 2020 presidential bids.

Booker has been in the state for a few days and will wrap up his trip with a house party in Nashua. House parties are a staple of campaigning in the state.

Harris planned an afternoon town hall in Portsmouth and will participate in the Politics & Eggs breakfast on Tuesday.

Klobuchar will hold a meet-and-greet in Goffstown on Monday before a CNN town hall.

Meanwhile, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York was back in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state, with plans to meet voters in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City.

Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who also is running for president, was campaigning in Iowa as well.

After Stelter Defends Media, Blow Admits Smollett Could Be an ‘Insane’ ‘Psychopath’","['Curtis Houck', 'Newsbusters Managing Editor']",https://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/2019-02-18-cnn-nd-smollett2.jpg,"['stelter', 'blow', 'went', 'media', 'insane', 'victims', 'psychopath', 'trying', 'think', 'crimes', 'admits', 'thats', 'defends', 'smollett', 'hate']","CNN’s New Day provided more tone deafness Monday morning on the part of the establishment media in reaction to reports that actor Jussie Smollett orchestrated and staged an early-morning attack against him last month in Chicago. But there were some surprising takes, most notably New York Times columnist Charles Blow admitting that, if reports are true, that makes Smollett an “insane” “psychopath.”

Co-host Alisyn Camerota went into damage control on behalf of the media in the 7:00 a.m. hour, stating to America’s “hall monitor” Brian Stelter that she recalled how, “in the hours right after this happened, that CNN — that our bosses were advising to pump the brakes a little bit because there were some things already that didn't add up.”

“I was, frankly, surprised how many people jumped on board to side with Jussie Smollett before there were photos, before there were police statements, before all that stuff,” she added. Way to go, Captain Obvious!

And right on cue, Stelter continued his press tour trying to cover for he and his colleagues (click “expand”):

Lots of parts of this story didn't make sense, but activists, actors, Hollywood celebrities, friends of Smollett, Democratic presidential candidates — they all wanted to sound like they were doing the right thing, saying the right thing, standing up for a victim. There's an inherent tension in this story between wanting and needing to believe victims and yet, knowing that people could take advantage of that, taking advantage of the idea that it's important to believe victims and that tension has been this story for weeks. There was a rush to judgment. I think it was mostly in the celebrity press and among activists and among Twitter people. I think it was really careful reporting by news organizations, but it all gets lumped in together at the end of the day. It all gets lumped in together in the minds of many people[.]

Between articles such as this one by Mediaite’s Caleb Howe, threads by the likes of Cameron Gray, and studies (here and here) published at NewsBusters, the media played a role in elevating Smollett’s version of events and has left the press with egg on their face.

Fill-in co-host John Avlon appropriately mentioned other recent fake hate crimes such as ones at the Air Force Academy and UVA, but he muddied the waters by insisting that we should “take a victim’s word first” plus “due diligence” and pleading to note that there is a “larger context of hate crimes in this country because in 2017, I believe it is, over 7,000 hate crimes in the United States,” which “was up 17 percent compared to 2016.”

Blow eventually condemned Smollett, but it was hampered by the fact that he went out of his way to defend him because, like Blow, Smollett is gay (click “expand”):

[I]f this is true, it was very believable that a gay man who could be gay bashed. If you take the celebrity out of this and if you dig down into your hate crime numbers, it is even more stark among people who are queer in this country. They are more likely to be assaulted, both sexually and not sexually and by everybody, including authorities and they don't have the platform. Many of them are estranged from family. Many of them experience kind of housing insecurity and food insecurity. They just don't have the voice and so, the big concern for me is whether or not it impacts those genuine victims and their ability or their willingness to come forward and say something happened to me....Jussie is very close to the character he plays on television. He is a musician, he is gay. He has — in his personal life he has been involved in some very worthy kind of community actions, including most recently, trying to save a historically black women's college in the south — Bennett College. He does that sort of thing.

Instead of trying to walk and chew gum at the same time, Blow and Stelter didn’t so much criticize Smollett (though the former would) as express concern about the impact this story will have on reporting hate crimes (which is also valid):

BLOW: I think Brian made an important point about, like, the collision of healthy skepticism — CAMEROTA: Yeah. BLOW: — with the historical truth that people are not generally believed on the — STELTER: And when it becomes cynicism and when it becomes an excuse to ignore real crimes and real problems, then that's even worse.

A few moments after Camerota laughably praised ABC’s Good Morning America co-host Robin Roberts for having “pressed him on some of” the details in her absurdly soft interview, Blow finally then went ballistic on Smollett (click “expand”):

AVLON: So, by elevating it and making a national metaphor, what is he trying to communicate? If it's all the bottom of a hoax — BLOW: Let me — AVLON: Not that you can get inside his head, but he's the one raising this to a national element, which — elevating it to a national conversation, which makes the possibility of it being a hoax that much more devastating. BLOW: Well listen, if Jussie has done what the Chicago Police say he has done, it's not just that he's an actor, Brian. This is an insane person. This is — this is a psychopath, like, and — and there's nothing in his history that suggests that he's a psychopath. CAMEROTA: Well, why — BLOW: That's why it's so hard for everybody — that's why people are waiting, trying to figure out like please go back and interview him Chicago P.D. — AVLON: Yeah, got to do it. BLOW: — because we need to understand what's the motive because nothing — I've met him one time. He was the sweetest — it was just in passing at Essence Fest and I was with a girl I went to college with — she's a big fan and he — she had to have a picture. He was the most gracious person and I think that that's the kind of feeling that people have about him. So if you did this, we need to know — like, are you crazy? Like, are you — did you like literally lose it because nothing is adding up about why he would do this?

Like a child with crumbs all about who feigns ignorance about the disappearance of the cookies, Smollett is holding on.

The hosannas had barely softened from Smollett’s retelling of the courageous fight he gave his attackers. But Chicago police were a total disappointment. A fraud. Police did not sweep the alleged crimes by Trump supporters under the rug like they were supposed to do; they investigated it like the Lindbergh kidnapping.

Nigerian brothers were found, questioned extensively, and then released without charges. After hearing the evidence, about how they were friends with Smollett, how he paid them $3,500 to help, where and when they bought the rope, and how they rehearsed the crime, the smart-money bet was that Smollett was a moment away from a tearful confession. No, sir. In what seems to this armchair psychologist like a clear case of cognitive dissonance, Smollett doubled down, insisting he is now even more victimized.

He fired his new criminal defense attorney and hired some others, releasing this statement on Sunday:

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth, and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

What are you going to believe: Smollett’s statement or all the observed and collected evidence?

Smollett’s claims of a physical attack by Trump supporters animated by his race and sexual identity are false. There was a hate crime in Chicago, but it was committed by a gay black man against all those who stand in opposition to left-Democrat policies. While there is no special crime attached to smearing Trump supporters like there is for bias crimes against blacks, for instance, there is a law that calls Smollett’s behavior a felony, and he should expect to be charged with it.

Falsely reporting a crime in Illinois is covered by statute , and it seems Smollett’s actions amount to a Class 4, the lowest level felony crime in the state, which calls for imprisonment of no more than three years upon conviction. This month a man in Illinois was sentenced to three years in prison for hoaxing an Amber Alert, for instance.

When the truth is on the table and Chicago police can stop pretending they think Smollett may be a victim, remember one thing – this was an attack on everyone who thinks Donald Trump is not Hitler. Keep that in mind as you see Smollett’s story crumble into the pile of lies that it is. It was all based on a lie fed to Smollett his whole life: that America is a racist, homophobic place. Sadly, the perpetrators of that lie will go unpunished."

New reports claim the actor/singer rehearsed his now-infamous Chicago attack days before it went down.

According to the latest reports, brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo told law enforcement they scouted a location with Smollett in an area where a camera would capture the attack.

Our sources say the brothers told police Jussie said he wanted to make it a “physical thing,” but not to the point he’d be seriously injured. On the night Jussie says he was attacked, the brothers claim they showed up at the scene but were extremely nervous because, just as they played out the scene, a car drove by and they were worried they’d be ID’d. Our sources say the brothers performed per the rehearsal — they screamed out they recognized Jussie from “Empire” and then hurled the racist n-word and the homophobic f-word. (TMZ)

A few hours ago, comedian Donnell Rawlings flooded his Instagram page with digital smoke aimed at Smollett.

As a result, Smollett allegedly paid two men $3,500 each to rehearse and then attack him a week later in an attempt to frame Trump supporters as violent racists.

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards. Other sources corroborated that information. The blockbuster revelation into at least part of Smollett’s potential motive comes two days after CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar reported Smollett and two brothers — Ola and Abel Osundairo — staged the attack on Jan. 29 in Streeterville. -CBS 2 Chicago

CBS 2 reporter Charlie De Mar spoke on the phone with the Osundario brothers Monday afternoon, who said in a joint statement: ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

I just spoke to Ola and Abel Osundairo on the phone. It was brief but they stressed the following.



“We are not racist. We are not homophobic. And we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”https://t.co/0TtYH1awDE — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) February 18, 2019

Smollett received a letter containing a ""white substance"" at Empire's Chicago Cinespace Studios where the show is filmed, prompting a HAZMAT response that failed to gain much traction. The ""white substance"" was later found to be aspirin.

The note was crafted with letters apparently cut out from magazines to form words. The pieced-together message contained racial and homophobic threats directed at Smollett. A magazine is one of the pieces of evidence retrieved from the brother’s home last week during a search conducted by CPD. Investigators also recovered a book of stamps. The brothers are acquaintances of Smollett. When asked about the letter in a televised interview last week, Smollett said, “On the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing toward it.” It also had “MAGA” — reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan Make America Great Again – written as the return address. “In due course all the facts will reveal themselves and at the end of the day my clients are honest and credible” the brothers’ attorney Gloria Schmidt said. -CBS 2 Chicago

Smollett to be in play with a similar ""assault""?

The Daily Mail reported on Monday that Smollett ""landed in Chicago shortly after midnight"" one day after he was in New York City for a reading of the play ""Take Me Out,"" which features a gay character who is attacked using ""the same racial slurs Smollett told police his attackers screamed at him, including 'f****t' and 'n****r.'""

On Monday, Smollett's new crisis management rep Anne Kavanaugh reported ""There are no plans for Jussie to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett's attorneys will keep dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.""

Smollett picked the wrong camera

After the alleged ""attack"" on January 29 in which Smollett alleged that two attackers recognized him, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him (from the reading he had just flown back from), beat him up, poured a bleach-like liquid on him, wrapped a noose around his neck, and warned him ""This is MAGA country!"" - Smollett made sure to tell Good Morning America last week that he spotted a surveillance camera that caught the entire incident.

Alas, as Breitbart's John Nolte notes, Smollett then admitted his disappointment that the camera was facing the wrong way.

And one can imagine, had there been surveillance footage of the attack, the investigation would have proceeded very, very differently. Once police had the footage, it would leak. Once cable and network news had the footage, it would loop endlessly. The fact that the two brothers are black wouldn’t matter. CBS Chicago reports that a black face mask was found in their apartment. Smollett told police the attackers wore face masks. With those face masks, the organized left (the media, Democrats, celebrities) were allowed to assume his racist attackers were white. Breitbart

Just another hate crime hoax in America (allegedly, of course)."

""We can’t make people love each other, but we can sure hold them accountable if they harm each other,” Sharpton said at the end of his “Final Thoughts” segment headlined, “We’re with you Jussie.”

But amid multiple reports this weekend that Smollett may have been involved in orchestrating the attack, Sharpton, who made his name in the 1980s as the spokesperson for Tawana Brawley in what turned out to be false claims she was raped by four white men, changed his tune on-air on Sunday.

“If it is found that Smollett and these gentlemen did, in some way, perpetrate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum,” Sharpton said referring to the actor and two men linked to him who have been questioned by police. “Let us get to the bottom of it, and let justice be done, no matter who is right or wrong.”

POLITICIANS WHO JUMPED ON JUSSIE SMOLLETT ATTACK CLAIM IN AWKWARD SPOT

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, has claimed he was attacked by two masked men early on Jan. 29 as he walked to his Chicago apartment from a Subway restaurant. Smollett alleged the men shouted racial and anti-gay slurs at him.

Sharpton famously lost a defamation suit when the Brawley attack was eventually found not to have happened. Now, there are reports that Smollett might have also orchestrated an alleged attack, as several local and national news reports have cited sources saying the attack was a hoax, reports the Chicago Police Department have not confirmed.

Last week, Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers in the reported attack but released them Friday without charges. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the pair had given officers information that had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident, "" Guglielmi said Sunday.

Smollett received an outpouring of support from politicians, celebrities and journalists when he first went public about the alleged attack in January. Smollett claimed at least one of the attackers said to him, ""this is MAGA country,"" in reference to President Trump's campaign slogan.

The Brawley rape allegations in the late 1980s left an entire community on the brink of “civil war” – and a recent Fox Nation documentary took a closer look at one of the most racially-charged legal sagas in American history.

The New York teen's claims -- in which she said she was allegedly raped in the woods by multiple white men in Wappingers Falls, NY, and then left wrapped in a feces-covered plastic bag with racial slurs written on her body -- helped springboard the careers of activists including Sharpton. But after an extensive investigation filled with twists and turns, a grand jury found the allegations to be an elaborate hoax.

Smollett's lawyer has denied his client had anything to do with his alleged attack in Chicago.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

According to reports, the payout is somewhere in the $60 to $80 million range. Add that to his multi-million dollar Nike ad campaign, and it’s clear that martyrdom has been a lucrative gig for the former quarterback. So lucrative, in fact, that he won’t return to professional football for less than $20 million. Beggars can’t be choosers, they used to say. Just one of many old nuggets of wisdom that’s been turned on its head in our upside down world. Kaepernick has turned victimhood into a business. And business is good.

His case may shed some light on the Jussie Smollett situation. As it becomes more and more inescapably clear (though it was pretty obvious from the beginning, we should note) that the “hate crime attack” against Smollett was an elaborate and poorly staged hoax, people may wonder why a guy with a cushy job on a network television show would risk it all on such an idiotic ploy. The people confused on this point have not been paying very close attention. As Kaepernick demonstrates, victimhood pays. We have elevated victimhood to a desirable status. Our children are raised to crave it, envy it, seek it. The great paradox of modern American culture is this: victimhood equals power.

It wasn’t always this way. There was a time when a man would never dream of inventing a story about getting beaten and defiled. If anything, his tall tales would run the other direction. If he was going to fabricate a physical altercation with imaginary assailants, he would be the victor in the story. He wanted to paint himself as the tough guy, not a pitiful sap who got doused with bleach by a couple of random punks. If he really did get into a fight, he would exaggerate to make you feel sorry for the other guy. He didn’t want to be a victim. To him, victimhood was degrading and humiliating. Even if he really was a victim, he did not like to think of himself that way.

I don’t mean to suggest that there is shame in being an actual victim. I only mean that if we have to err in one direction or another, it’s probably better to err on the side of embarrassment at our victimhood rather than excitement. Better to not see ourselves as victims when we are than to see ourselves as victims when we aren’t. At least the former stems from a healthy human instinct. The latter is gross and small and pathetic and it is rapidly creating a country full of Smolletts.

I say that victimhood “pays,” but it’s important to understand that the payment comes in more than one form. Indeed, if Smollett’s gambit had worked out as he planned, he would have ensured himself a continued gig on his current show and an endless supply of acting jobs thereafter. Film and television producers would have been anxious to demonstrate their compassion by finding a role for the guy who got assaulted by MAGA thugs. This is the financial benefit of victimhood.

And then there is the emotional payment that victimhood confers. You will notice that people who invent hate crimes are rarely cancer patients. They usually aren’t poor, either. They aren’t refugees who fled unimaginable brutality and misery. They aren’t Holocaust survivors. They aren’t elderly black people who lived through segregation and Jim Crow. No, those sorts of people don’t need to go looking for pain and misfortune. They have seen quite enough of it and know that there is nothing sexy about it. The hate crime hoaxers, on the other hand, lead enviable and cozy lives. Their primary hardship is their lack of hardship. They fetishize oppression because they feel ashamed of their privilege. How appropriate that Jussie Smollett is a Hollywood actor living in a Chicago high-rise. He is exactly the type for this kind of thing: bored, comfortable, well off, empty. Persecution is a game to him because it has never been a reality.

I suppose we should feel grateful that we live in a country where people have to hire their own oppressors. But we should be worried that so many people find oppression desirable in the first place."

LOS ANGELES — The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the ""Empire"" star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it's all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!""— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump's election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett's own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had ""shifted"" — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police ""are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released.""

Smollett's attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D'Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

""And Libs wonder why we don't believe their BS stories,"" Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push ""the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.""

The response from Smollett's celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn't know what to say, but that the situation is a ""mess"" and a ""travesty.""

""I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,"" Gay wrote. ""The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.""

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a ""modern-day lynching."" On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment ""until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.""

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she ""can't blindly believe"" the Chicago Police Department.

""The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I'll wait,"" DuVernay said.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it's that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: ""Whatever the outcome, this won't stop me from believing others. It can't.""

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

""I'm not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,"" Gay wrote. ""Because more often than not they are telling the truth."""

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in ""MAGA Country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

Al Sharpton has called for “accountability to the maximum” in the Jussie Smollett case — even if it is determined that the alleged “hate crime” turns out to be a hoax staged by the “Empire” actor himself.

WATCH:

Sharpton initially responded to the alleged attack as many did — by condemning it in the strongest possible terms.

“For Jussie, who’s not only a superb actor and singer but an activist who has fought against homophobia and racism and sexism, to be a victim is something that is totally unacceptable,” he told TMZ. “I challenge the Chicago law enforcement to do all within their power to find out those that are guilty and they should face the maximum penalty of law.”

As news broke over the weekend that Chicago police appeared to be changing the direction of their investigation, Sharpton was quick to announce that his opinion had not changed.

During his MSNBC show “PoliticsNation” on Sunday, Sharpton explained, “I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum.”

Sharpton went on to say that if Smollett had orchestrated the attack as a hoax, he still felt the same way about the way that it should be handled.

“I still maintain that,” he said. “And if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.”

“Activist and MSNBC commentator the Rev. Al Sharpton said on his program, “Politics Nation,” #JussieSmollett should be held accountable if he is behind the attack. “I among many others, when hearing of the reports, said that the reports were horrific…”- https://t.co/OYOsHDY0kQ — Reverend Al Sharpton (@TheRevAl) February 18, 2019

Sharpton was not the only one calling for Smollett to be held accountable if he was, in fact, involved in perpetuating a hoax. (RELATED: 18 Days Ago, Ellen Page Blamed Mike Pence For Alleged Jussie Smollett Attack)

Gallup polling reveals a steady four-decade decline in overall trust in mass media, reaching a 32 percent nadir in 2016, down from 72 percent in the 1970s. Regarding fake news, a 2018 Monmouth University poll found that 77 percent of Americans “believe that traditional major TV and newspaper media outlets report ‘fake news,’” up from an already-troubling 63 percent in 2017.

Instead of showing remorse -- or even a hint of introspection -- regarding the wholesale complicity of the media in spreading the Jussie Smollett scam, many prominent media figures instead have resorted to obfuscation, almost ensuring more such farces in the future. For example, anyone who knows Chicago well at least questioned the likelihood of random Trump-motivated thugs roaming a deserted street at 2 a.m., shouting into a brutally frigid night that “this is MAGA country.” As a relatively known Trump spokesman who is regularly accosted by complete strangers in Chicago, I can tell you with certainty that my hometown is not “MAGA country.” Yet, Vox’s Liz Plank tried to explain away the media’s lack of healthy skepticism by falsely asserting to CNN’s “Reliable Sources” that “the people repeating that quote were not news outlets. … We can’t confuse celebrity tweets with the media and press.”

I truly wish that only vapid celebrities leapt to falsely condemn Trump and his supporters because of Smollett, but the harsh reality directly contravenes Vox’s propaganda. For example, Washington Post’s Global Opinions editor Karen Attiah tweeted, “Smollett could have been killed by those thugs screaming MAGA. Let that sink in.” Similarly, White House correspondent April Ryan posted, “The attack on @JussieSmollett is a hate crime and should be treated as such!” Vanity Fair’s official Twitter account stated, “Jussie Smollett was hospitalized after suffering a racist and homophobic attack by two MAGA supporters.” BuzzFeed’s Ryan Schocket proclaimed that “these are the people our president is emboldening. This is what the red hat stands for.”

Contrast that torrent of defamatory coverage with the scant mainstream media reaction to an earlier act of actual political violence in the same city in 2016. The day after Trump’s shocking electoral triumph, David Wilcox was brutally assaulted and carjacked on a Chicago street, on camera. The criminals and onlookers specifically cited Trump during the attack, shouting: “You voted Trump…beat his ass…don’t vote Trump.” Mr. Wilcox had, in fact, voted for Trump, although no one in that crowd would have known his preference. Quite unlike the fake Smollett case, this real tragedy attracted little attention, and no condemnation at all from media luminaries.

Sadly, the Smollett case reaffirms a reality that I have been detailing ever since Trump ascended: The preponderance of mainstream media writers and broadcasters masquerade as journalists but, in actuality, serve as resistance opposition megaphones.

Given the already-frayed comity of our public discourse, our society desperately needs better behavior from the Fourth Estate. Anchors and reporters need to practice authentic journalism, and leave the punditry to transparently partisan operators like me. In addition, the condescending demonization of vast swaths of America needs to cease. MAGA hats are not KKK hoods, and supporting “America First” policies does not equate to Nazism. It is imperative in these polarized times that the press regain trust by reining-in systemic bias and reclaiming the honorable role of journalists as truth-seekers, first and foremost."

Now that Chicago police have said they are investigating the case not as a possible hate crime, but as a possible hoax, and have confirmed Smollett is no longer is considered a victim, one social-media giant apparently doesn't like it.

PJ Media reported Facebook dumped two posts about the apparent hoax:

TRENDING: 'Lockdown Queen' Whitmer wants Trump to bail out her state from COVID damage

My friend @JenKernsUSA’s incisive column on #jussiesmolett and the hoaxes of the past, has been blocked by @facebook for “violating community standards” — but you can read and share it here — https://t.co/qHkRBzdP6x — Harmeet K. Dhillon (@pnjaban) February 16, 2019

The report said Facebook was preventing people from sharing two conservative articles on how Smollett's claim was unraveling.

The comments were from Rod Dreher, author of ""The Benedict Option: A Strategy for Christians in a Post-Christian Nation,"" and Daily Caller reporter Jen Kerns.

The incident had been characterized as an example of what President Trump was inspiring.

See Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters' take:

Waters charged Trump was ""dog-whistling"" and said the purported opposition to homosexuality and blacks exemplified in the ""attack"" was ""coming from the president of the United States.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, while not directly blaming the president, said there is no place for homophobia and racism in society.

Monday, CBS reported, two Nigerian brothers arrested in the case were released and described by police as no longer suspects.

A source told the network the two claimed Smollett paid them for the attack. They said they purchased the rope at a hardware store and have evidence of the sale.

Police said they were asking for a followup interview with Smollett, whose lawyers said there were no plans for him to talk with police again.

Canada Free Presss noted Smollett's sisters, actresses and activists Jurnee Smollett-Bell, and Jazz Smollett-Warwell, ""worked as leading campaign surrogates for former President Barack Obama, and less than a year ago, videos of Jussie dancing with Michelle Obama went viral.""

Smollett claimed two men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him and screamed ""This is MAGA country"" at him during the ""attack.""

The report said: ""Smollett-Bell posted the following message about her support for Obama on Instagram on President Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day: Feeling a lot of emotions. I remember meeting then Senator @barackobama 9 years ago. I’d been invited to introduce him in Nevada during the primaries. He was the underdog, the odds were stacked against him. Said he was too young, too black, too different … he was an other. I’ve always been an other so I saw myself in him. My own relative told me I was wasting my time, going state to state, knocking on doors for this guy with the funny name. I can’t tell you how many people hung the phone up on my sister @jazzsmollettwarwell and me as we clocked in our hours, phone banking.""

Chicago police said Saturday their investigation had changed.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview,"" they said.

The two suspects who were cleared, Ola and Abel Osundairo, were captured on surveillance video at the time of the attack. Ola Osundairo is connected to Smollett through the hit show ""Empire,"" on which he played a prisoner.

WND requested comment from Facebook and got an automated response.

The Daily Mail of London said Smollett was ""furiously"" denying he paid the two Nigerians $3,500 to carry out a fake attack.

Smollett's lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, released a statement claiming their client further was being victimized ""by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth.""

During the investigation, it was revealed there was no security video footages of the attack, and Smollett handed over only partial telephone records he said would support his claim.

House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi went back into her social-media timeline and deleted a tweet that was sympathetic to Smollett.

Her tweet said: ""The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love…""

The Daily Caller reported, however, that others have yet to retract their original statements.

According to Newsbusters, ABC's Good Morning America crew was forced into ""full damage control mode"" when the story flipped and Smollett no longer was the ""victim.""

""Just last Thursday, anchor Robin Roberts had given the actor a softball interview, even refusing to call his story of a Trump supporter assaulting him, 'alleged,'"" the report said.

She, however, noted that police reports Smollett set up the attack were ""alleged.""

Variety said Smollett, contrary to claims, was not being written out of the show.

At theRoger Friedman's Showbiz411 noted the show's ratings had been fading fast.

""The last season, which started in September, returned with just 6 million viewers. The second week saw a decline of 1 million. On November 14th, the number dropped below 5 million to 4.8 million. The show finished on December 5th with just over 5 million total, and a weak 1.50 in the demo,"" the report said.

""Was Smollett worried about the ratings? His so-called mugging was the most publicity 'Empire' has had in eons. Whether Smollett’s story turns out to be true or not, it will definitely have an impact on the March 13th return. It could be this was some kind of misguided effort to get attention."""

Specifically, their minds are filled with imaginary “hate crimes,” almost all of which turn out to be complete hoaxes woven from the cobwebs of mass hysteria. (Seriously, you are witnessing a large-scale “shared delusion” that reflects the deeply disturbing mass mental illness of the Left.)

Of course, liberals desperately hope the hate crime hoaxes are real. That’s what gives their pathetic existence meaning. They need to tell themselves they are fighting against injustice, censoring people to halt “hate,” and calling for violence against conservatives in order to establish “tolerance” and “peace.”

Hate crimes and SJW propaganda have become the religion of the lunatic Left. These misguided, pathetic individuals have abandoned belief in God, and in His place, they now worship fairy tales of persecution and victimhood. They are deranged, deluded and dangerous to any free society. Yet the left-wing media colludes with this cultist, amplifying the hate crime hoaxes and lending legitimacy to entirely fabricated claims that have no basis in reality.

You can easily write the script for the next hate crime hoax, because they all follow the same pattern

And so the fake hate crime hoaxes continue to spill out, and the left-wing media uncritically catapults every one of them into the public psyche, not bothering to check a single fact as long as the story follows the desired narrative: White people wearing (MAGA hats / KKK hoods / American flags) attacked (famous actor / innocent bystander / journalist) for being (gay / trans / black / Latino / Muslim) while screaming (racial slurs / homophobic slurs / Islamophobic slurs / etc.). You can practically write the script yourself, or even program a hate crime hoax generator script to write these for you.

The problem is, they’re almost all fabricated by the “victims” themselves… as in the case of Jussie Smollett, the Empire actor who reportedly paid two Nigerian black dudes to attack him in a staged hate crime hoax that he used to promote his career as a “victim.”

Of course, CNN, the New York Times and everybody else ran with the story and concluded Smollett’s narrative was a “fact,” even without a single supporting piece of evidence to back up his story.

Facebook censors voices of reason that question the fake hate crimes

Even worse, now that the narrative is unraveling by the hour, Facebook is going to great lengths to censor stories that expose the hate crime hoax. As PJ Media reports:

Over the weekend, Facebook prevented people from sharing two conservative articles on the unraveling case of Empire star Jussie Smollett, which seems to be a hate hoax. Both Rod Dreher, author of The Benedict Option: A Strategy for Christians in a Post-Christian Nation, and Daily Caller reporter Jen Kerns saw their articles censored on Facebook.

“You are not allowed to say on Facebook that Jussie Smollett carried out a hate hoax,” Dreher tweeted on Sunday with a screenshot of Facebook blocking his article at The American Conservative.

You are not allowed to say on Facebook that Jussie Smollett carried out a hate hoax. pic.twitter.com/jnFx7aQFbS — Rod Dreher (@roddreher) February 17, 2019

As usual, Facebook’s censors answer to no one, yet they selectively censor whatever speech they don’t want you to read, claiming it violates some form of “Community Standards.”

It is the tech giants, in fact, who helped catapult this massive scam into public consciousness. When all dissenting views and voices are banned from speaking, the gates are wide open for wildly delusional, fabricated hoaxes to get picked up and magnified by the dishonest media and anti-free speech social media companies.

Here’s a more complete list of fake hate crime hoaxes from recent memory

One website that documents fake hate crimes is called FakeHateCrimes.org. The site has received so much web traffic recently that it cratered and is currently offline.

Meanwhile, twitter user Andy Ngo has tweeted out a series of fake hate crime hoaxes, which you can read here until twitter bans his account and de-platforms him for daring to speak the truth. (That’s what twitter routinely does to voices of reason and sanity.)

Right after Donald Trump’s election, the SPLC really stoked panic. A pro-gay Episcopal church in Indiana was vandalized w/“Heil Trump,” a swastika, & an anti-gay slur.

Among other photos on the account is a cover image of anti-Trump messages.

Its cover photograph is of a row of pink post-it notes which read: 'Donald Trump is President,' 'This is not normal', 'Donald Trump is evil' and 'Don't be complacent.'

Among the comments written beneath the photograph is one by Biden's 20-year-old granddaughter Finnegan.

She said: 'Never saw this. I like it.'

Malia moved into freshman dorms in August 2017, a few months after she posted it on her profile.

The actor tearfully defended his version of events and questioned skeptics. ""It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth,"" he said, suggesting race played a role in the way his story was received. He'd said the attackers were white. ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me ... that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""

Smollett denied reports that he'd said his attackers were wearing President Donald Trump's signature MAGA hats. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae,"" he said. However, Smollett did say he believed he was targeted because he's been critical of Trump: ""I come really, really hard against 45.""

Smollett told police that early in the morning of Jan. 29 in Chicago, two assailants berated him with racist and homophobic slurs, beat him and put a rope around his neck. Given the brutality and hateful nature of the alleged assault —Smollett is an openly gay black actor whose Empire character is also openly gay — his story received widespread media attention almost immediately.

But questions about the alleged attack increased as the investigation progressed, and culminated on Feb. 21, when Chicago Police announced that Smollett’s story was a hoax and he was arrested for allegedly filing a false police report. He was later indicted on 16 felony counts.

Nearly a month later, on March 26, prosecutors made the surprising announcement that they were dropping all charges against the actor.

“After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett’s volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case. We stand by the Chicago Police Department’s investigation and our decision to approve charges in this case.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at the time of his arrest that the actor staged the attack on himself because he was dissatisfied with his salary.

“Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Johnson said.

Smollett denied the charges against him after they were dropped, saying after his emergency court hearing that “I would not be my mother’s son if I was capable of one drop of the charges against me.”

Here’s what you need to know about Smollett’s allegations and how the story surrounding them has evolved over time.

January 29: Police say they’re investigating an alleged assault

Jussie Smollett reports to police that he was attacked in the early hours of Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago. He says that he was picking up food at a Subway sandwich shop when he was approached by two masked men. The actor claims that the two men beat him while barraging him with racist and homophobic slurs and saying, “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. The men then allegedly put a rope around his neck, poured an unknown chemical on him and ran away.

Smollett then goes back to his apartment, and his manager calls the police. When the police arrive, they find that Smollett has cuts and scrapes, and that there is a rope around his neck. Police say that the suspects appeared to have beaten Smollett with their hands. Smollett later tells a reporter that he did not take the rope off his neck before police arrived because he wanted to show it to investigators.

After police advise him to seek medical attention, Smollett goes to Northwestern Hospital.

Later that day, police say that they are investigating the alleged assault on Smollett as a possible hate crime.

January 30: Surveillance footage released

Police release surveillance footage that shows Smollett walking to his apartment after visiting the Subway. Later that day, a police spokesperson tweets photos of “persons of interest” in the case.

Police say that there were gaps in the footage, and that none of the video showed an attack on Smollett.

A police spokesperson says the FBI is also investigating a threatening letter that was allegedly sent to Smollett at the Chicago studio where Empire is filmed.

January 31: Police say footage shows Smollett with a rope around his neck

Police announce that they found footage that shows Smollett arriving at home with a rope around his neck. The footage does not show Smollett being attacked, but police say that they still have a significant amount of video footage to analyze.

February 1: Smollett speaks out for the first time about alleged attack

Through his publicist, Jussie Smollett releases his first public comments about the attack.

“My body is strong but my soul is stronger,” the statement says, according to The New York Times. “More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Responding to those who have raised suspicions about his claims, Smollett adds that his account had been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” and that he is cooperating with authorities.

“Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” the statement says.

February 2: Smollett makes first public appearance

In his first public appearance since the alleged attack, Smollett performs at a concert at the Troubadour nightclub in West Hollywood.

“I have so many words on my heart that I want to say, but the most important thing I can say is thank you so much, and that I’m O.K.,” Smollett tells the audience, according to The New York Times. The Times reports that several attendees said that they had bought tickets to the concert specifically to show their support for Smollett.

February 11: Smollett gives redacted phone records to police

Smollett hands over redacted phone records to police. Police later say that the files are too significantly altered to be useful for the investigation.

Smollett later issues a statement to say that the files had been redacted to “protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

February 13: Two Nigerian brothers arrested in connection with the investigation

Two men, who are ultimately identified as Nigerian brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, are picked up by police in connection with the investigation at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago. Smollett’s attorneys later acknowledge that one of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, who they say had been hired to help the actor prepare for a music video.

February 14: Smollett opens up about alleged attack—and reacts to some calling it a hoax—on Good Morning America

Speaking to Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, Smollett says that he was “forever changed” by the attack.

He adds that he is “pissed off” that some people doubt his version of the attack.

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth,” Smollett says.

The police also announce that they are questioning the two “persons of interest” arrested at O’Hare, who they say had been recorded on surveillance cameras near the attack. The two men are not suspects, but are being questioned because they might have been in the area of the attack during the incident, police say.

Later that night, the Chicago Police Department officially disputes news reports citing police sources who claimed the attack was a hoax, saying that the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

February 15: Police release Nigerian brothers without charges

Police announce that they have released Osundairo brothers without charges. A police spokesperson says that investigators have uncovered new evidence, and that “detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

February 16: Police say they want to interview Smollett again

Chicago Police say that they intend to interview Smollett again.

Smollett’s lawyers said in a statement to CNN that the actor felt “further victimized” by accusations that the assault was a hoax.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement says.

February 17: Police say they will not confirm details of the investigation without interviewing Smollett again

Police say that they’re still trying to interview Smollett because the direction of the investigation has “shifted.” One of Smollett’s spokespeople declines to comment on whether Smollett had consented to another interview.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” a police spokesperson says.

February 18: Smollett’s lawyers says he does not plan to speak with police again

Smollett’s attorneys say that there aren’t plans for the actor to meet with police for a follow-up interview. A spokesperson for the lawyers says that they “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf,” according to a statement sent to the Associated Press.

February 19: Police discount a tip about Smollett being seen in an elevator with the two brothers who were later arrested

Chicago police dismissed a tip they received that Smollett was seen in an elevator in his apartment building on the night of his alleged attack with the Osundairo brothers that police had arrested and released. Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said the tip was “unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives.”

Chicago police said that the two brothers who were arrested and released have met police and prosecutors at the courthouse, according to the Associated Press.

February 20: Chicago prosecutor recuses herself from investigation

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the case “out of an abundance of caution,” according to her office.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” Foxx’s spokesperson Tandra Simonton said, the Associated Press reports. Simonton did not specify who Foxx might be familiar with in the case.

The AP also reports that in 2007, Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence, citing details of a misdemeanor complaint first reported on by NBC News. According to the complaint, Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake Smollett, and signed a false name on a promise to appear in court.

Smollett was charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of giving false information, along with the other charges, and later finished an alcohol education and treatment program as part of his sentencing terms.

On Wednesday, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment addressed rumors that Smollett would be written out of Empire.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” the said in a statement.

February 21: Smollett arrested after being charged with allegedly filing a false police report

Chicago police said Thursday that Smollett was taken into custody on the felony charge of disorderly conduct in falsifying a police report. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters Smollett orchestrated the attack because he was unhappy with his salary.

Smollett paid the two Nigerian brothers — who were released without any charges — $3,500 by check to carry out the hate crime attack, Johnson said. The allegedly staged attack came after Smollett sent himself a letter with racist and homophobic language to earn attention, according to Johnson.

“This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and certainly didn’t deserve,” Johnson said.

Smollett was released Thursday about two hours after his bond hearing, during which a judge set his bail at $100,000. He was ordered to surrender his passport and not to contact the two brothers arrested and released in the case.

March 26: Cook County prosecutors announce all charges against Smollett have been dropped

After an unexpected emergency court hearing, Cook County prosecutors confirmed that all charges against Smollett had been dropped.

“After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett’s volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case.

We stand by the Chicago Police Department’s investigation and our decision to approve charges in this case.”

Smollett’s lawyers said that the actor’s record “has been wiped clean.”

Smollett said after the hearing, “This has been an incredibly difficult time. Honestly one of the worst of my entire life. But I am a man of faith and a man that has knowledge of my history and I would not bring my family, our lives or the movement through a fire like this. I just wouldn’t.”

Later, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson took part in a joint press conference. Johnson said “he stands behind the detectives’ investigation, while Emanuel fumed that dropping the charges amounts to a “whitewash of justice.”

“This is an unbelievable not just whitewash of justice, this is a person now who has been let off scot free with no sense of accountability of the moral and ethical wrong of his actions,” Emanuel told reporters.

March 28: Smollett Ordered to Pay $130,000 to Offset Investigation Costs

The City of Chicago sends Smollett a letter ordering him to pay $130,106.15 to offset the costs of the investigation. The sum would be separate from the $10,000 bond he agreed to forfeit when the charges were dropped.

The letter says that over two dozen detectives spent weeks investigating the crime, but that “Ultimately, the Chicago police investigation revealed that you knowingly filed a police report and had in fact orchestrated your own attack.”

Earlier thatday, Smollet’s lawyer Tina Glandian defends the actor’s innocence in an appearance on NBC’sToday show. She says that Smollett has been further victimized by claims that he had faked the attack, and that he was just hoping to move on with his life.

“What he’s been through after the fact has really been a much harsher attack than what he endured that night,” Glandian says.

Glandian says that she is not concerned that the Department of Justice and the FBI are continuing to investigate Smollett. She also suggested that the Osundairo brothers might have their race by wearing whiteface, pointing to a video one of the brothers posted online wearing white makeup to imitate the comic book villain the Joker.

President Trump also weighs in on the situation on Twitter, writing that he wants the FBI and the Department of Justice to look into the investigation.

“FBI & DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago. It is an embarrassment to our Nation!” Trump tweets.

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” the 36-year-old actor’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, shared with The Wrap Monday as reports surfaced that the investigation into the alleged attack of the actor has turned its focus toward the star. (RELATED: Chicago Police Say ‘Empire’ Actor Refuses To Turn Over Phone Records)

“Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate,” the statement added. “Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Police told CBS Chicago that they are still working with the star’s attorney to schedule a time for a “follow-up interview” with Smollett.

A FOX reporter also tweeted that he has hired a “Chicago based crisis management consultant.”

“#JussieSmollett lawyers have hired #Chicago based crisis management consultant Anne Kavanagh. I’m told she was also hired by former @Chicago_Police officer Jason Van Dyke who killed Laquan McDonald,” Rafer Weigel wrote.

It comes after two potential suspects who had been arrested and questioned in the connection with the alleged assault were released without charges.

According to the Associated Press, authorities said the investigation into the alleged attack had “shifted” based off information obtained by the two brothers, who are said to be cooperating with law enforcement.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

On Saturday, two unnamed law enforcement sources shared with CNN that investigators believe Smollett may have paid to two men—Nigerian brothers who had connection to the actor—to stage the attack.

Smollett’s attorney hit back at reports Saturday that the attack had been a hoax.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement.

It all comes on the heels of reports that Smollett claimed he was attacked near his home on Jan. 29th. He told police he was attacked by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, along with a reference to “MAGA” (Make America Great Again). They also reportedly put a rope around his neck and threw a bleach-like chemical on him."

Al Sharpton addressed the controversial turn of events during his MSNBC weekend show, “PoliticsNation,” declaring that the “Empire” actor should face serious consequences if it turns out he staged the alleged attack which occurred in Chicago last month.

“In the last 48 hours a lot has been said about the ongoing investigation into the alleged assault against actor Jussie Smollett,” Sharpton, no stranger to controversial hoaxes himself, said on Sunday’s program.

“I among many others, when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come within law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,” he asserted. “I still maintain that.”

Of course, like many on the left, Sharpton had to sing a different tune as new reports indicated Smollett’s case may be headed before a grand jury after he claimed he was assaulted in Chicago on Jan. 29 by two men shouting “this is MAGA country” while pouring a liquid on him, and hurling racist and homophobic slurs against him.

New evidence led police to believe Smollett hired actors to stage the fake attack after arresting and questioning Nigerian brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, who were released without charges but provided evidence that police said shifted the “trajectory of the investigation.”

Sharpton came to the actor’s defense last month, as did countless others on the left.

“For Jussie, who’s not only a superb actor and singer but an activist who has fought against homophobia and racism and sexism, to be a victim is something that is totally unacceptable,” Sharpton told TMZ last month. “I challenge the Chicago law enforcement to do all within their power to find out those that are guilty and they should face the maximum penalty of law.”

But after the unraveling story continued to be updated, the 64-year-old activist weighed in again.

“If it is found that Smollett and these gentlemen did, in some way, perpetrate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum,” Sharpton said, attempting to put himself on the right side of the unfolding story.

As for his fellow progressives who were quick to defend Smollett and condemn the critics who dared question his tale, Sharpton offered the proverbial scapegoat, using President Trump to make his point.

“Let’s not act like this is some left-wing hoax that some are saying on social media. President Trump called this horrible and he’s certainly not a left-winger,” he said. Naturally, if Trump had opted to say nothing about the alleged attack, he would have been slammed for not caring – or worse – supporting the alleged pro-Trump attackers.

Even Al Sharpton! You know you’ve become toxic when even Al Sharpton wants to keep his distance https://t.co/Hp9zlSrDYE — Dinesh D’Souza (@DineshDSouza) February 18, 2019

“Many across the spectrum, because of Smollett’s history as an actor and an activist, stood and said this needs to be looked into. None of us talked directly with him. We were alarmed at what was reported,” Sharpton continued, taking aim at the president’s son next.

“Donald Trump Jr. started tweeting yesterday, well, they just did this to discredit those that wear MAGA hats. Jussie Smollett went on ‘Good Morning America,’ Don Jr., and said it didn’t happen. So people who were told that were being misled,” he argued.

“Let us get to the bottom of it and let justice be done no matter who is right or wrong. We cannot not get to the truth here,” Sharpton concluded.

His self-righteous take on the drama was slammed on social media where many reminded the former White House adviser for President Obama that he had quite the history of racially motivated hoaxes himself. Sharpton played the part of spokesman in the late 1980’s for then-15-year-old Tawana Brawley, a black teen who alleged she was raped by six white men.

After nearly one year and a grand jury case, Brawley’s story was found to be totally fabricated.

Twitter users noted the “parallels” in the stories and called out Sharpton as, among other things, a “hypocrite” and a “hustler.”

Actually, @JussieSmollett is a combination of Tawana Brawley AND Al Sharpton. Smollett’s a lying “victim” of a fake race/sexual orientation assault.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers ""will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.""

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in ""MAGA Country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

Over at CNN, anchor Alisyn Camerota says the bosses at her network were skeptical of Smollett’s story from the start, noting that she was “surprised” to see how many people enthusiastically believed him.

“I remember in the hours right after this happened that CNN, that our bosses were advising to pump the brakes a little bit because there were things already that didn’t add up,” Camerota told Brian Stelter, according to The Blaze. “I was frankly surprised how many people jumped on board to side with Jussie Smollett before there were photos, before there were police statements, before all that stuff.”

Defending his colleagues and the mainstream media as a whole, Stelter blamed the firestorm that erupted in the wake of Smollett’s alleged attack on “activists, actors, Hollywood celebrities, friends of Smollett, [and] Democratic presidential candidates” along with the “celebrity press.” Stelter commended the mainstream media, however, for doing “really careful reporting.”

As noted by The Blaze, Camerota’s assertion that CNN was “skeptical” of Smollett’s alleged hate crime is farcical on its face. In fact, the moment it hit the news cycle, CNN’s Brooke Baldwin said, “This is America in 2019.” Later that day in another segment, CNN’s national correspondent Ryan Young in Chicago delivered a monologue presenting Smollett’s victimization as a given:

But this is kind of a shock. And we’ve seen, of course, the buzz on social media surrounding this case. But then when you think about the idea on top of that — the idea that racial slurs and maybe even some of the homophobic slurs being used toward him — you can see how serious this crime is right now. A lot of the people who work in this industry also live in this part of the town, so you can understand the concern even as we’ve been talking to people in this area. There’s been a sharp reaction to this crime. Hopefully we’ll learn more from police in the next few hours … been giving them calls to figure out exactly what detectives have so far, maybe a vehicle description or some sort of build. Don’t have any of that information so far, but it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out.

Baldwin immediately replied, “Absolutely despicable.”

Jussie Smollett has denied all reports he staged the attack by hiring two Nigerian brothers. Speaking through his lawyers over the weekend, the actor has reportedly been further victimized by the hoax allegations."

Smollett’s story fit perfectly into the mass hysteria fueled by Trump Derangement Syndrome: two men wearing MAGA hats tried to lynch a black, gay actor who is an outspoken critic of the sitting president. If something sounds too good to be true, however, chances are it is. According to Chicago police, the whole incident was staged and Smollett’s ‘attackers’ were two Nigerian brothers who worked as extras with him on the show ‘Empire.’

The ‘racist lynching’ of Jussie Smollett now seems to be just one more in a long list of hate hoaxes perpetrated by people eager to cast themselves as virtuous victims of President Donald Trump, each hyped by the media and then quickly – and quietly – abandoned once the truth came out.

What makes the Smollett incident different, however, is that it was quickly and vocally embraced by a laundry list of liberal celebrities and Democrats:

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-California), for example, tweeted on January 29 that “The racist, homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is an affront to our humanity.” She has since deleted that tweet, but it’s not easy to scrub something off the internet.

Smollett was also backed by Democrat presidential hopefuls Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) and Kamala Harris (D-California), chair of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff (D-California) and the rising party star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), to name just a few.

While some of these politicians have quietly deleted their tweets in hopes the embarrassment will go away, others have chosen to leave them up but ignore follow-up questions, or say they were waiting for more details before offering an opinion.

This has obviously not escaped the attention of their critics, including the president’s son, Donald Trump Junior.

Hey Hollywood and media types, I’ve noticed a lot of you deleted your #JusticeForJussie tweets... what’s the matter, don’t you want justice for him anymore??? #frauds — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 18, 2019

Meanwhile, the same media outlets that breathlessly reported on the original claim and quoted the celebrity and political outrage are now trying to bury the narrative collapse with euphemisms and spin it as “conservatives pounce.” Here is the Associated Press on Monday, for example:

the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The “pouncing” primarily consisted of journalists from conservative outlets pointing out that the mainstream media was willing to uncritically repeat the original claim and amplify the outrage without actually doing its job of investigative reporting.

As one astute Twitter user pointed out, the only thing in question was whether these media outlets would lead with “conservatives pounce” or try to rationalize the hoax by claiming it “started a very important conversation.”

In no time flat, the Washington Post was running with the take, “I wish this had been true because the lie would be so much worse.”

Making a false police report is considered disorderly conduct in Illinois, a Class 4 felony, and carries a sentence of up to three years in prison. In practice, it is extremely unlikely either Smollett or those promoting his hoax will ever answer for it.

The Grand Jury was notified it would hear the Jussie Smollett case Tuesday, but there is now a 50/50 chance it could be delayed for several days ... law enforcement sources tell TMZ.

We broke the story, the Grand Jury will hear testimony, specifically targeting the actor, for allegedly filing a false police report.

Our sources say the 2 brothers who claim they carried out the staged attack at Jussie's behest -- will appear voluntarily. They have not been subpoenaed.

We're also told the 2 brothers -- Abel and Ola Osundairo -- have not received immunity from prosecution, although we're told they did not file a false police report or give false information to the cops. Law enforcement says Jussie is the one who lied.

Our sources say there may be a delay in the testimony, because cops want to make sure they have all the records necessary for Grand Jurors to reach a conclusion on whether to indict Smollett."

As CrimeOnline previously reported, Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said this weekend that authorities were seeking to interview Smollett, after the investigation reportedly found that Smollett allegedly paid for the rope used in the alleged assault, and may have paid two brothers $4,000 a piece to orchestrate the assault, which Smollett had characterized as a hate crime.

The two brothers were detained last week and have been reportedly released from custody. According to multiple reports, the brothers claimed that they along with Smollett rehearsed the attack three days before it took place, 0n January 29.

According to CBS Chicago, police have not named Smollett a suspect in the incident, but want to question him about “new evidence” gleaned from interviews with the two brothers.

But as of Monday, Smollett has not made arrangements to speak to police, a spokesperson for his attorneys said.

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” the spokesperson said in an email to CBS News on Monday.

“Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

The attorneys reportedly said in a statement to CBS News that Smollett was nothing more than a victim of the alleged attack, and that he did not have a previous relationship with the men accused of assaulting him:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

CrimeOnline will provide further updates as more information becomes available.

CHICAGO — Attorneys for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives Monday for a follow-up interview about his reported assault.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett received the endorsement despite police reports claiming he orchestrated being the victim of a racially and homophobically-charged assaulted by Trump supporters.

“[Smollett] remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” said a joint statement from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment.

The endorsement from the major network and studio for potentially a Class 4 felony is a stark contrast to ABC’s treatment of Roseanne Barr over a series of tweets.

Barr’s commercially successful titular sitcom was canceled almost immediately after multiple tweets targeted globalist kingpin George Soros and former Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett.

Moreover, the mainstream media’s official reasoning for Barr’s termination was her tweet against Jarrett.

“Muslim Brotherhood & Planet of the Apes had a baby = vj,” said Barr’s May 2018 tweet.

Barr later claimed she had no idea Jarrett was black.

But Barr’s comments on Soros being a Nazi and his ties to ABC seems to have really triggered ABC dropping the cash cow show and actor.







Soros is tied to ABC as well as other major outlets, according to the Media Research Center.

“[Soros] has ties to more than 30 mainstream news outlets – including The New York Times, Washington Post, the Associated Press, NBC and ABC,” reports MRC.org.

If Barr’s tweets set the bar for termination, then doesn’t Smollett’s situation warrant the same treatment?

The news comes after new information emerged over the last few days prompting law enforcement to ""shift"" the course of their investigation.

""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, claims two masked men yelling racial and anti-gay slurs attacked him as he was returning to his Chicago apartment at approximately 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He says the men beat him, poured some sort of chemical on him, and placed a rope around his neck – all while declaring, ""This is MAGA country!""

However, police say information provided by two Nigerian brothers regarding the incident had ""shifted the trajectory"" of the probe.

According to Chicago's CBS 2 News, Smollett paid the siblings $3,500 to stage the Jan. 29 attack before departing for Nigeria and promised them an additional $500 when they returned to the states. The brothers were released Friday without charges.

When the alleged attack was first reported, some on the Left rushed to call it a hate crime. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), a Democratic presidential contender for 2020, called it a ""modern-day lynching.""

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), another Democratic presidential contender, used the exact same term, tweeting: ""The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching.""

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe. To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention. https://t.co/EwXFxl5f2m — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) January 29, 2019

But the latest development in the probe has fueled the suspicions of skeptics who have long claimed the alleged Smollet attack was nothing more than an elaborate hoax with the news media rushing to join the cause.

""It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted over the weekend.

""Shocked, I really thought MAGA folks (who are all over downtown Chicago) were waiting with a rope/bottle of bleach to ambush a righ guy at 2am in minus 4 degrees because those are conditions where all people go out for Subway rather than order Seamless. Seemed so real,"" he tweeted later.

While news of the attack initially garnered widespread support widespread sympathy and support for Smollett, some appear to be backing away from their defense of the actor.

For instance, The Blaze reports that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who took to Twitter to denounce the ""racist, homophobic attack"" on Smollett as ""an affront to our humanity,"" has since deleted her tweet.

And some in the media, like ABC's Robin Roberts, who interviewed Smollett last week regarding the alleged attack, appeared to acknowledge the growing skepticism surrounding the Smollett attack.

""When I sat down with Jussie it was Tuesday night in Chicago, at the time to give his first account, publicly give his first account of what he said happened,"" Fox News quoted Roberts as saying. ""At that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.""

Sen. Cory Booker is now ""withholding"" his comments about the alleged incident, but he's not retracting his initial ""modern-day lynching"" assessment. At the same time, Booker is using the suspicious Smollett case to continue to argue that right-wing, white supremacists are the main source of terrorism in America. See his comments in the tweet below:

Meanwhile, The Associated Press reports that attorneys for Smollett say their client feels ""victimized"" by the suggestion that he'd staged the assault, insisting, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Smollett has also sought to dispel the notion that he's been less than forthcoming with police regarding the investigation. The actor has turned over heavily redacted phone records to prove he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the alleged incident; however, police said that was not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

Empire Star Jussie Smollett Has Been Cleared: Everything We Know About His Alleged Hate Crime

Two months after Jussie Smollett reported that he was the victim of an apparent hate crime in Chicago and one month after he was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for making false reports, all charges against him have been dropped.

“After reviewing all the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett’s colunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case,” reads a statement from the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office obtained by PEOPLE on Tuesday.

It’s a stunning turn in the investigation into whether Smollett, who is black and gay, orchestrated the attack on himself.

Here’s a timeline of everything we know about the case.

Jan. 29

The Chicago Police Department confirmed in a statement that an Empire actor was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery” at around 2 a.m. on the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street in downtown Chicago.

According to the initial police statement, a “36-year-old man was walking … when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him. The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

Smollett, who was in “good condition,” was treated at Northwestern Hospital, according to police.

In a statement, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said “the entire studio, network and production stands united in the face or any despicable act of violence and hatred — and especially against one of our own.”

The Fox show’s creator, Lee Daniels, also spoke out about the incident, calling the actor his “son” and saying, “It’s just another f—ing day in America.”

The apparent hate crime came a week after Fox Studios’ Chicago offices allegedly received a threatening homophobic letter addressed to Smollett. In photos of the alleged letter, which is reportedly being investigated by the FBI, the words “you will die black f–” are spelled out in magazine letter cut-outs.

Jan. 30

In a statement to PEOPLE, Chicago Police confirmed that Smollett remembered his attackers calling out President Donald Trump’s slogan, “MAGA,” an acronym for “Make America Great Again.”

“In the initial reports there was no mention of MAGA,” the statement read. “When detectives [followed] up with him later in the day, he recalled the offenders making those comments and detectives completed a supplemental report.”

Police added that “detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline” and that Smollett was “fully cooperating with investigators.”

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi revealed that investigators had acquired footage that could lead to the arrests of the Empire actor’s assailants. The police also released two photos of the persons of interest; however, the images did not show the individuals’ faces.

Jan. 31

Smollett’s family released a statement about the incident, standing by the actor.

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” they said. “Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.”

Feb. 1

Smollett released his first public statement since the incident.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you,” he told Essence. “The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” he continued. “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me. With love, respect & honor … Jussie.”

Feb. 2

Smollett made his first public appearance since the attack, taking the stage at the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

“There are so many words on my heart that I want to say,” he began. “The most important that I can say, to keep it simple, thank you so much. I’m okay… I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be. I’m going to stand strong with y’all.”

“I had to be here tonight,” he continued. “I couldn’t let those motherf—ers win. So I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. I hope that you all stand with me.”

Clarifying reports about the attack, Smollett said “there has been a lot of stuff that has been said about me that is absolutely not true.”

“There are just a couple of points that I wanted to make really quick… I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked,” he said. “I went to the doctor immediately — I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take it easy, obviously. And, above all, I fought the f— back.”

Feb. 14

Smollett, who has since returned to work on the Fox show, gave his first in-depth, televised interview about the incident to Good Morning America. After detailing what occurred and hitting back at critics who had questioned the accuracy of his account, Smollett got emotional, confessing his fears that his assailants wouldn’t be found.

“I want that [surveillance] video found so badly for four reasons,” he said. “Number one, I want them to find the people that did it. Number two, I want them to stop being able to say ‘alleged attack.’ Number three, I want them to see that I fought back. And I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought back. It does not take anything away from people who are not able to do that, but I fought back. They ran off, I didn’t.”

“Learn to fight. Learn to be a fighter,” he continued, addressing young gay men. “I am not advocating violence at all, so let’s be clear about that. If you’re going to die, fight until you do. If you don’t fight, you have no chance. I have fought for love. I’m an advocate. I respect too much the people — who I am now, one of those people — who have been attacked in any way.”

After being asked if he’d be able to heal if his attackers were never found, Smollett broke down.

“I don’t know. Let’s just hope that they are, you know what I’m saying? Let’s not go there yet,” he said, crying.

“I was talking to a friend and I said, ‘I just want them to find them.’ And she said, ‘Sweetie, they’re not going to find them,’ ” he said. “That just made me so angry. So I’m just going to be left here like this? I’m just going to be left here? They get to go free, go about their life, and possibly attack someone else. And I’m here left with the aftermath? That’s not cool to me. That’s not okay.”

“I understand how difficult it will be to find them but we’ve got to,” he insisted. “I still want to believe, with everything that happened, that there’s something called justice.”

In response to reports by Chicago-based news outlets that Smollett staged his attack in a bid to keep his job, Fox denied that the actor’s character was being written off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” the network said in a statement. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

At the time, Chicago PD shot down the reports, too.

“Media reports [about] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” police said in a statement obtained by The Advocate. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Feb. 15

Two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, were released without charges two days after being arrested.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging,” Chicago PD spokesman Guglielmi announced, adding that detectives “have additional investigative work to complete.”

Feb. 16

Reports emerged that the brothers claimed the Empire star paid them to stage the incident.

According to CBS Evening News, a police source said the brothers said Smollett paid them to participate in the incident and purchase the rope that was found around his neck.

CNN also reported that two Chicago police sources said investigators believe Smollett paid the men in exchange for carrying out the attack, and that the men were fully cooperating with authorities.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Smollett denied the allegations in a statement released by his attorneys: “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” Smollett’s lawyers said. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate,” Smollett’s attorneys added. “At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

Feb. 17

Chicago PD refused to comment on the speculation that the attack was a hoax.

“While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation,” Guglielmi said in a statement released Sunday afternoon via Twitter.

The spokesman went on to write that “detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

Feb. 18

In a statement obtained by PEOPLE on Monday, Smollett’s rep denied that the actor would be meeting with authorities and declined to comment further.

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” said the rep. “Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

Feb. 21

Smollett turned himself into police and, hours later, appeared in bond court. His family sat in the courtroom as text messages between the Osundairo brothers detailing how the attack was allegedly orchestrated were read aloud.

“Smollett texted Abel stating, ‘Might need your help on the low. You around to meet up and talk face to face?’ ” according to the bond proffer from prosecutors obtained by multiple news outlets. “Smollett then stated that he wanted to stage an attack where Abel would appear to batter him. Smollett also suggested that Ola assist him with the attack.”

According to prosecutors, once the brothers told Smollett they “could trust” him, the actor allegedly stated he “wanted them to appear to attack him, to “catch his attention by calling him an ‘Empire F—– Empire N—-,’ and “not hurt him too badly and give him a chance to appear to fight back.”

In addition, Smollett allegedly texted that he “wanted Ola to place a rope around his neck, pour gasoline on him and yell ‘This is MAGA country,’ ” also allegedly instructing the men to purchase red baseball caps which resemble the ones that say President Donald Trump‘s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Judge John F. Lyke Jr. set Smollett’s bond at $100,000, which the actor posted. Smollett was released and asked to surrender his passport. His next hearing was scheduled for March 14.

In a scathing statement, Smollett’s attorneys argued that Smollett’s “presumption of innocence … was trampled upon” and that he “is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Hours later, Smollett returned to the Chicago set of Empire.

Feb. 22

Empire‘s executive producers announced that the actor’s character Jamal Lyon would be removed from the final two episodes of season 5.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” said Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer. “Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

March 1

Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo’s attorney released a statement to CBS Chicago, saying the brothers regretted their involvement in the scandal and apologizing to the victims of real hate crimes.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” the statement read.

March 12

Although he was not required to attend a hearing regarding whether cameras would be allowed to film his trial, Smollett appeared in court alongside his legal team. The actor chose to attend“to show confidence in his innocence,” his representative, Anne Kavanagh, told PEOPLE, adding, “He will do everything he needs to do. He will go the extra mile to cooperate with the process.”

March 14

In a Chicago courtroom, Smollett pleaded not guilty to the allegation that he lied to police and staged his own attack.

March 26

In a shocking move, Smollett was cleared of all charges.

“Today, all criminal charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped and his record has been wiped clean of the filing of this tragic complaint against him,” attorneys Tina Glandian and Patricia Brown Holmes said in a statement. “Jussie was attacked by two people he was unable to identify on January 29th. He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks made to the public causing an inappropriate rush to judgment.”

The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed the charges against Smollett had been dropped.

“After reviewing all the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett’s colunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case,” reads a statement obtained by PEOPLE."

Jussie Smollett has no plans to meet with Chicago detectives on Monday, his lawyers said in a new statement.

Attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson did not give a timeline as to when — or if — the “Empire” star will be re-interviewed in the wake of police saying new evidence has “shifted the trajectory” of their investigation into the alleged hate attack.

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate,” the lawyers said in the joint statement Monday. “Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

Anthony Guglielmi, a Chicago Police Department spokesman, noted that Monday is a federal holiday and that police are making “good faith efforts to schedule a mutually beneficial time” though none has been scheduled.

“We’ve put out a formal request to his attorneys that we want to speak to him,” Guglielmi said. “We simply have some new information that we have to discuss with him and go over.”

Asked whether Smollett is classified as a victim or suspect, he said, “I’m going to stop short of calling him a victim or an offender or a suspect.”

Smollett has not yet turned over complete cellphone records — even though cops have requested them, Guglielmi added.

Police previously said the redacted records he initially turned over 13 days after the attack were “incomplete” and insufficient for a criminal investigation.

Questions are mounting over Smollett’s claims that two strangers shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him Jan. 29, doused him in bleach and threw a noose around his neck.

Cops are seeking to grill Smollett after last week interviewing two brothers — Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo — who they say were in the area the morning of the attack.

News reports claim Smollett offered to pay the brothers $4,000 to stage the assault."

From @AP: Celebrities 'rallied behind Smollett' when he alleged MAGA attack. Now, with growing evidence attack was hoax, some conservatives have 'gleefully seized' on the news. https://t.co/haqOV2zL4n — Byron York (@ByronYork) February 18, 2019

This is just sad:

The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media. But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment. The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

If there was a “national outrage” over the dubious incident, it was limited to gullible left-wing journalists, celebrities, politicians, and activists.

The “narrative” only seemed “cut-and-dry” to people who were looking at the case through lenses clouded by their anti-Trump bias. It seemed made up to those of us who noticed that Smollett’s allegations were outlandish, implausible, and riddled with inconsistencies from the get-go.

Yet even as his story started falling apart (which happened almost immediately), the national media clung to their precious narrative.

There’s been much commentary in the past few days about the MSM’s lack of critical thinking skills in covering not only the Jussie Smollett “hate crime” fairy tale, but a number of other bogus stories as well.

Over the years, the MSM has fallen for hundreds of hate crime hoaxes, reporting on them as if they were confirmed facts, rather than mere allegations. By the time the story is proven to be a hoax, the media has already moved on to the next manufactured outrage. This phenomenon has only increased since the election of President Trump. Yet people still expressed shock and surprise when it became obvious that Smollett had staged his own hate crime.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn’t know what to say, but that the situation is a “mess” and a “travesty.” “I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

The AP goes on to note that “there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.”

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.” Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett. “I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,” Gay wrote. “Because more often than not they are telling the truth.”

They say this even as the egg is still dripping from their faces. Meanwhile, Trump supporters who are sick of being smeared are said to be “gleeful” because another hate crime manufactured to make them look bad turned out to be a hoax.

But fake hate crimes aren’t the only type of bogus story the MSM routinely falls for.

In the past two years the national media has also rushed to embrace the phony Steele dossier, a multitude of fake Deep State leaks on the Trump/Russia probe that turned out to be spectacularly wrong, the outlandish Kavanaugh smears, and the Covington smears.

PJ Media’s own Roger Simon called the media’s propensity for believing the unbelievable “magical thinking.”

Good Therapy defines magical thinking as “the belief that one’s own thoughts, wishes, or desires can influence the external world. It is common in very young children. A four-year-old child, for example, might believe that after wishing for a pony, one will appear at his or her house.”

Another possible explanation for the media’s gullibility would be confirmation bias, which is defined as “the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one’s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.” The overwhelmingly liberal media tend to embrace stories that confirm their own biases and ignore those that don’t.

The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway meanwhile bluntly noted on Twitter that much of the media’s credulous reporting on dubious stories in recent months can be explained by the fact that a lot of reporters just aren’t terribly bright.

The elephant in the room for media malfeasance discussions is that many reporters are simply not smart. They fall for hoaxes easily. Over and over and over again They are obviously not well read. That this is combined with a completely unwarranted arrogance compounds the problem. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) February 17, 2019

They uncritically accepted ""MAGA thugs roving Chicago, attacking celebrities."" People that politically biased and stupid are simply not going to have the appropriate amount of skepticism for an actual $$multi-million info op such as ""Trump-Russia!"" run by skilled professionals. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) February 17, 2019

However, many commenters here at PJ Media and elsewhere are convinced that the media — en masse — knew the story was bogus from the start, but pushed it anyway because it fit their anti-Trump narrative. That may be true for some in the media, but I think that’s giving most of them too much credit.

I suspect that a combination of all of the above can explain the epidemic of fake news in the past few years. Their left-wing bias has been a disgrace for decades and it it’s only getting worse. Sadly, there’s no reason to believe it won’t continue to sully their reportage for the foreseeable future."

Sharpton was addressing the incident on Sunday after Chicago police said they were still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that 'shifted' their investigation of the reported attack.

It shifted after police questioned two Nigerian brothers, Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, following allegations Smollett paid them $3,500 to assault him in an orchestrated, rehearsed attack.

Sharpton, a civil rights leaders, said the alleged attack on Smollett was a 'reminder of the times we live in' when it was first reported on January 30.

Reverend Al Sharpton believes Jussie Smollett should be held accountable 'to the maximum' if it is found that the Empire actor staged a homophobic and racist attack on himself

The Democratic reverend doubled down on his rebuke of it on Sunday.

'I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,' Sharpton said on MSNBC's PoliticsNation.

'I still maintain that. And if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.

He added, however, the it was not a 'left wing hoax' like some had claimed on social media because even President Trump had condemned the incident.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and 'This is MAGA country!'

He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Smollett said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Reports emerged last week that the actor may have staged the attack to save his job on Empire with the help of the two brothers who he supposedly knew as extras on the show.

The Empire actor has said he was targeted in a homophobic and racist attack in Chicago on January 29. It has since emerged that Smollett may have allegedly paid two Nigerian brothers $3,500 to assault him in an orchestrated attack

Chicago PD confirmed on Thursday that the pair seen in this image from surveillance footage around the time of the attack on January 29 (above) were Abel and Ola Osundairo

It was claimed that Smollett allegedly paid Nigerian brothers Abimbola 'Abel' (left) and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo (right) to attack him on January 29

The pair decided to cooperate with police after investigators revealed that they had evidence the brothers bought the rope that was put around Smollet's neck at the nearby at Crafty Beaver Hardware Store hardware store.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt 'victimized' by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that: 'Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.'

The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as 'suspects' in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

Jussie Smollett has denied he paid two Nigerian brothers who were extras on Empire to help stage a homophobic and racist attack on him outside a Subway in Chicago

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

'It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,' the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim.

Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

One of those people supporting Smollett was House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who wrote on the day of the attack: 'The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.'

Smollett, an actor on the television show “Empire,” claimed he was attacked on Jan. 29 at 2 a.m. in freezing temperatures by two white men who hurled slurs at him while wrapping a rope around his neck and dousing him with bleach.

But reports over the weekend indicated that two Nigerian brothers appeared to be the assailants and that the brothers told detectives they were paid by Smollett to stage the attack.

Al Sharpton was among the civil rights activists who said Smollett should face legal consequences if he was involved in staging the alleged attack.

Najee Ali, a Los Angeles-based civil rights activist and director of Project Islamic HOPE, held a press conference in the city on Sunday and said he thinks Smollett is lying about being a victim.

“Jussie Smollett must be brought to justice for lying,” he told reporters, reported ABC 7.

He said that the alleged lie was an injustice to real victims.

“We have many members of the black community and the LGBTQ community who have been the victims of hate crimes. So for Smollett to say that he was a victim of racism and hate crimes—and we believe that is a lie—certainly is an injustice to those true victims of racism and hate crimes,” he said.

Many actors, actresses, directors, activists, reporters, and analysts were among the slew of people who initially believed the attack was real and denounced supporters of President Donald Trump and Trump himself after learning that Trump supporters were allegedly behind the attack.

Some refused to retract or change their stance in light of the new information, saying it was too early to do so. Others even said it didn’t matter whether Smollett was lying or telling the truth.

“Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t,” director Ava DuVernay, who directed “Selma” among other movies, wrote on Twitter.

She was referring to how Chicago Police Department officer Jason Van Dyke shot McDonald, 17, in 2014 after a witness reported the teenager was breaking into cars. Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder.

Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one?

In a sampling of extreme rhetoric after the reported attack, actor Billy Eichner wrote on Twitter: “I want Trump and all MAGA lunatics to burn in Hell.”

Eichner has not apologized or retracted his statement.

Parallels were drawn by many between the reaction to the alleged Smollett attack and the reaction of alleged racism shown by Covington Catholic high school students. Both incidents drew widespread condemnation from a host of media and non-media pundits, while more evidence emerged later that appeared to change the story completely.

“The Covington Kids and Jussie Smollett stories are the same. The media chose to believe the narrative that was most damaging to Trump supporters, even in the absence of facts or logic. This is why there is animus towards the media and why #fakenews resonates,” wrote Lisa Boothe, a Fox News contributor on Twitter.

“When we see the same reporters instantaneously believe the smear of Covington Catholic, and then instantaneously believe Jussie Smollett’s far-fetched story, and then the media establishment decide the story is conservatives pouncing, it can breed distrust in the media,” added Tim Carney, a Washington Examiner opinion editor.

After a short video clip appeared of the Covington students interacting with Native American activists in Washington, Hollywood producer Jack Morrissey took to Twitter to post a video showing people wearing “MAGA” hats being shoved into a woodchipper, which spewed out blood from the other end. “#MAGAkids go screaming, hats first, into the woodchipper,” Morrissey wrote.

He later took down the video and apologized.

Robin Roberts said on “Good Morning America” on Feb. 17 that she relied on Smollett and the Chicago Police Department for her reporting.

“When I sat down with Jussie it was Tuesday night [Feb. 11] in Chicago, at the time to give his first account, publicly give his first account of what he said happened,” Roberts said.

“At that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.”

As Smollett Story Unravels, ABC Defends Robin Roberts’ Softball Interview https://t.co/OUEa1nXSkq pic.twitter.com/EAEzg0F3vP — MediaResearchCenter (@theMRC) February 18, 2019

Reports emerged over the weekend that two Nigerian brothers were allegedly paid by Smollett to stage the attack, which he then blamed on supporters of President Donald Trump.

Smollett claimed that on Jan. 29 two men wearing ski masks dumped bleach on him and wrapped a rope around his neck, telling the “Empire” actor that Chicago was “MAGA country,” apparently in reference to Trump’s slogan “Make American Great Again.”

Police confirmed the brothers were arrested and then released but have not confirmed the reports that Smollett was involved in planning the attack or that he could face a grand jury, saying they want to speak with him again based on information they received from the brothers.

During Monday’s show, ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams told Roberts that comments Smollett made during the interview could be used against him if the story does indeed turn out to be false.

“In that interview, [Smollett] specifically says, ‘Yeah, those two guys on the surveillance footage, those are the guys that attacked me,’ so now he’s sort of boxed in,” Abrams said.

During the interview, Smollett repeatedly slammed people who doubted his story.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

He said he felt people doubted him not because of his story, but because he was a critic of Trump.

Many media outlets passed along Smollett’s story without noting that the attack was alleged while the Chicago Police Department continued stating the attack was alleged and referring to Smollett as “the alleged victim.”

A slew of lawmakers, activists, reporters, and analysts reacted to the story by slamming Trump reporters and Trump himself and many have yet to apologize or retract their statements, noted Quillette editor Andy Ngo and Mediaite reporter Caleb Howe.

In her interview, Roberts neglected to refer to the attack as alleged. On Feb. 18, she did refer to the attack as alleged.

Among those criticizing Roberts was Curtis Houck of the media watchdog Media Research Center. “Roberts gave Smollett a soft platform to spin his tall tale less than 24 hours before it was blown to pieces,” Houck wrote, noting that ABC, CBS, and NBC spent a total of 101 minutes and 22 seconds on Smollett’s alleged attack from Jan. 29 through Feb. 14.

“ABC News gave Smollett a massive outlet with which to tell his story and they didn’t push back at all. They allowed it to percolate. ABC News should be held accountable and you and I both know if Fox did this, we’d have heard something different in this discussion,” added Resurgent writer Erick Erickson.

Abrams was among those critics against Roberts, telling her on Monday: “I have to say, Robin, even in the interview that you did, you were talking about the skeptics.” He added later, “You don’t want to go out and publicly start questioning someone who talks about a horrific attack like this until you’ve got the goods.”"

(Andrew Kelly/Reuters)

CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter on Monday blamed the “celebrity press” and avid Twitter users for uncritically reporting Jussie Smollett’s claim that he was attacked by Trump-supporting bigots before facts emerged that cast doubt on the allegation.

“I think it was mostly in the celebrity press and among activists and among Twitter people. I think it was a really careful reporting by news organizations. But it all gets lumped in together at the end of the day,” Stelter said on CNN’s New Day.

Stelter offered a similar criticism in his “Reliable Sources” newsletter, arguing that the public should take a more nuanced view of which organizations and individuals comprise “the media” when seeking to hold those who spread false reports accountable.

“Are there mistakes and built-in biases? Definitely. But most journalists are trying their best to report what’s true. This competitive, chaotic world of media contradicts Don Jr.’s imagined world,” Stelter wrote, referring to Donald Trump Jr.’s sweeping criticism of the media for accepting Smollett’s account.

Smollett, who is black and gay, told police that he was attacked after picking up a sandwich in Chicago around 2 a.m. on January 29. In his initial description of the attack, Smollett said two men beat him, poured an unknown chemical on him, and wrapped a noose around his neck. He later told police the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country” while fleeing — only after that detail was reported by TMZ the next day.

Chicago police on Friday questioned two Nigerian brothers, one of whom worked on the show Empire with Smollett, in connection with the attack, and announced that the brothers’ cooperation had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” They are now investigating whether Smollett himself hired the men to carry out a staged attack, as the two brothers claim. Smollett has maintained that he was attacked and did not perpetrate a hoax in statements released by his attorneys.

While TMZ and other “celebrity” outlets led the way in reporting Smollett’s claims uncritically, mainstream outlets, including CNN, Vanity Fair, the Washington Post, and others accepted Smollett’s version of events and cited it as yet another example of rising homophobia and racism in the Trump era. A number of reporters and editors at outlets including the Post, the Los Angeles Times, Rolling Stone, and Reuters similarly endorsed Smollett’s version of events on their personal Twitter accounts.

After Smollett’s account was widely disseminated by mainstream journalists, earning him the public sympathy of many Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls, Smollett was interviewed on ABC’s Good Morning America by host Robin Roberts last Thursday. During the interview, Roberts omitted the word “alleged” from any mention of the attack, and did not report that Smollett had, at the time of the interview, refused to turn over his complete phone records to Chicago police.

CHICAGO -- Attorneys for ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives Monday for a follow-up interview about his reported assault.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers ""will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.""

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in ""MAGA Country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they've requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett's lawyers say the actor feels ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault."

If you thought the possibility that out actor Jussie Smollett staged his own hate crime attack — something not yet confirmed — would be red meat for the right-wing, just look at Donald Trump Jr.'s Twitter account.

Usually riddled with conspiracy theories and attacks on his father's innumerable enemies, Trump Jr.'s Twitter is now consumed by the Smollett story. Seeing the incident as evidence that most hate crimes are phony and every Trump supporter harbors zero racism or homophobia, Trump Jr. appears fixated on pushing out Smollett stories.

The Advocate counted no less than 35 tweets, retweets, and references to Smollett on Trump Jr.'s account in the past 48 hours. Aside from minimizing the reality of hate crimes, Trump Jr. used the Smollett story for political brinkmanship and criticized African-American presidential candidates like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker who initially voiced support for Smollett.

The haunting never-seen-before images of bullet holes and a broken toilet lid in the bathroom of the home previously owned by Oscar Pistorius are a chilling reminder of where the Paralympian shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp 18 months ago.

The interior shots show the eerily empty rooms in the upmarket house in Pretoria that has laid vacant since that fatal night in the upstairs bathroom during the early hours of Valentine’s Day last year when the Paralympian shot at Miss Steenkamp through a locked toilet door saying he believed she was an intruder.

A broken window and an abandoned murky green swimming pool also vividly illustrates the desolate but once luxurious property that Pistorius and Steenkamp used to call home in the Silver Woods Estate.

The athlete has never returned to the house and has lived with his uncle ever since while he awaits for his fate to be handed down on his murder trial next month.

The Daily Mail reported just four weeks ago that the villa in a gated community finally sold for 4.5million South African rand at the beginning of this month after being on the market since March – about the equivalent of $170,000 less than the asking price.

It was confirmed that the 27-year-old, who is still on trial for murder, needed to sell the property to raise money for his legal bills, a total of at least $8,000 per day.

The buyer Louwtjie Louwrens, plans to retire to the property with his family.

'It is in a safe area and everyone I dealt with was very professional, ' he told the Times Live in South Africa.

'It stood empty for more than a year and there is some water damage, so we would first have to repair it.'

It is thought that the house remained sealed since it was handed back by police over a year ago.

Estate agent Ansie Louw, who was handling the sale said selling the property was an unusual process due to the situation.

'We were not allowed to take photos or put it onto our website. If they do open it they attract lots of people just interested in the case and it will be chaos,’ she said.

'It is not normal circumstances. It is not a normal process. But you know what some people say it doesn't bother them.'

Ms Louw also explained that there has been a lot of interest in the home since it went up for sale in March.

Pistorius valued the house at five million rand during his bail application in February last year.

At the time he also owned two other houses with a combined value of 1.5 million rand in Pretoria and a vacant plot worth 1.6 million rand in Cape Town.

All his properties together were worth 8.3 million rand, the sporting hero told the court.

Since the shooting he has lost many of the endorsement deals that earned him about $510,000 a year.

The athlete has been paying his own legal fees since the shooting, according to a statement released by his lawyers earlier this year.

The costs are said to include at least three full-time lawyers in court, ballistics and forensics experts as well as an American crime scene reconstruction company.

Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

Recently, police took two men into custody who were persons of interest in the attack, but released them after new evidence cleared them of any crime.

Chicago P.D. spokesman Anthony Guglielmi has continuously updated the public on the developments of the case, most recently stating, ""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.""

Smollet openly addressed the attack in a past statement provided to Essence, saying, ""Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" Smollett also said.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he continued. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

TMZ reported that the grand jury will convene beginning this week, citing law enforcement sources.

It’s not clear what type of case will go before the grand jury. According to reports over the weekend, the two Nigerian brothers who were arrested late last week were released after revealing to detectives that Smollett paid them to stage the attack, which the actor then blamed on white President Donald Trump supporters.

According to TMZ, the brothers are staying somewhere in downtown Chicago under the eye of police officers “so no one gets to them.”

“We’re told cops especially want to make sure Jussie does not contact the brothers,” the entertainment outlet claimed.

Mounting evidence appears to suggest that Smollett’s attack didn’t happen as he described.

Initially, the actor said two men wearing ski masks approached him on Jan. 29 around 2 a.m. in freezing temperatures and hurled slurs at him while tying a rope around his neck and pouring bleach on him. He claimed the men said that “this is MAGA” country, apparently in reference to Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”

But law enforcement sources told CBS and Fox that the Nigerian brothers told them Smollett planned the attack and that it was fake. The trio even rehearsed the attack several days before Jan. 29 and Smollett gave the brothers money to buy the rope from one store and a red hat from another, according to the broadcasters.

Law enforcement sources told TMZ that the story was suspect from the beginning, especially the part about the assailants recognizing Smollett from “Empire.”

“Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire,'” a source told TMZ.

The Chicago Police Department said in a statement obtained by Rafer Weigel, a Fox Chicago reporter, that “it’s certainly possible” that the case will go to a grand jury but that “it’s way too premature” to make that determination.

A police spokesman told Fox News on Sunday, “We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with Mr. Jussie Smollett before I can answer this question.”

In another statement, police confirmed information from the brothers “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

“We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

A spokesman added to Weigel that the grand jury could be a last resort if Smollett doesn’t voluntarily go in for questioning and noted the actor’s lawyers have given no indication to the police that he was planning on going in for questioning.

Statement from #Smollett crisis team: “There are no plans for #JussieSmollett to meet w/ Chicago police 2day. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.

Smollett has maintained his innocence. His attorneys issued a statement on Saturday saying the actor would cooperate with police but said he was hurt by reports he may have been involved in staging the alleged attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement said.

In an update on Monday, Smollett’s team said: “There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment.”"

Cardi B’s public call-out is coming after recent evidence suggests that the “Empire” star possibly staged the alleged homophobic and racist attack on him.

According to Cardi B, his actions ruined Black History Month. Reacting to the new development which is beginning to make people doubt Jussie Smollet, Cardi B shared,

“I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett- whatever the f*ck his name is. I’m really disappointed in him. I feel like he f*cked Black History Month, bro. Godd*mn. I’m not gonna say yet- until he say it out his mouth that it was fake and this sh*t was staged, I don’t wanna completely blame him, because somebody I was talking to- they said police in Chicago are racist.

Then, you gave f*cking Donald Trump immunity to f*cking laugh at n*ggas and sh*t. [You’ make m*=otherf*ckers look bad. Sh*t brazy, bro.”

It would be recalled that Smollet had alleged that he was attacked last month in Chicago by two men who hurled racist slur at him. He also said they chanted “this is MAGA country”, a statement which led many into believing it was done by Trump supporters. However, investigations which led to the arrest of two Nigerian brothers have hinted at the possibility that Smollet may have staged the attack by paying the two black men to attack him."

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said. “Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.”

The statement comes just days after two potential suspects in the case were brought in for questioning and released without charges.

A CNN report on Saturday, citing two unnamed law enforcement sources, said investigators believe Smollett may have paid the two men — Nigerian brothers with a professional connection to Smollett — to orchestrate the attack. According to the report, the men were released after agreeing to cooperate with investigators.

Smollett’s lawyers have denied that the reported attack was a hoax, saying “anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

A police spokesperson later said the department was “not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.” He did, however, indicate that there had been “developments” since the suspects were first taken in for questioning last week, and said police were seeking to re-interview Smollett.

Smollett was hospitalized on Jan. 29, and reported to police that he was assaulted near his Chicago home by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.” According to a police statement after the incident, the actor said he was battered “about the face,” had bleach poured on him and had a rope wrapped around his neck."

The openly gay Democrat walked back his comments on Jan. 30 blasting a New York Times story for describing the assault as a possible hate crime.

“‘POSSIBLE’ hate crime?” the 37-year-old tweeted. “This was an attempted modern-day lynching carried out by homophobic racists. PSA — please call racist things racist.”

Times deputy metro editor/politics Dean Chang replied on Monday, “We still don’t know all the answers here, but this is why we typically exercise more caution than you and others might prefer.”

Johnson agreed.

“You are right,” he responded to Chang. “As a gay man, I was deeply disturbed with what I was reading. But the tweet was unfair to investigators and journalists who often need time to figure out the facts of a case. As you said, we still don’t know all of the answers. I apologize.”

Over the weekend, the Chicago Police Department said new evidence in the case has “shifted the trajectory” of its investigation — as reports emerged that Smollett allegedly paid two bodybuilding brothers $3,500 to stage the attack on Jan. 29."

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” Anna Kavanagh, a crisis manager at MediaPros24/7 said in a statement Monday. “Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

Chicago police on Sunday said they requested a follow-up interview with Smollett due to “new evidence” they obtained that “shifted” their investigation into the 36-year-old’s alleged assault on January 29. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi would not comment on reports that Smollett orchestrated the attack and that a grand jury could hear the evidence. “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” Guglielmi said.

Smollett, who is gay and black, told police that two masked men hurled racist and anti-gay slurs at him and doused him with an unknown chemical substance as he walked home from a sandwich shop at around 2:00 a.m. local time. The actor said his assailants placed a thin rope around his neck and shouted “This is MAGA country!” before running away.

In a statement to ABC News, attorneys for Smollett said their client was “angered” and “further victimized” by accusations that orchestrated the alleged assault.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, Smollett’s lawyers, told ABC News. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” they continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

Chicago police on Wednesday picked up Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — the Nigerian brothers who are now suspected of having Smollett carried out the alleged staged attack — from O’Hare International Airport to question them about their possible involvement.

On Saturday, Fox 32 Chicago’s Rafer Weigel, citing several police sources, reported the pair purchased the rope found around the actor’s neck the night of the alleged attack at a local store. CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar reports at least one of the brothers purchased the rope at Craft Beaver hardware store the weekend of January 25th. The rope was bought at the direction of Smollett, De Mar, added. Further, the brothers were compensated $3,500 and promised an another $500 later, according to De Mar.

Smollett could receive up to three years in prison if he is found to have filed a false report with the Chicago Police regarding his alleged attack."

Stelter, a far-left pundit for the anti-Trump CNN, regularly spreads conspiracy theories to advance his radical agenda. Last April, Stelter told his audience Fox News controls the actions of President Trump. In June, he spread a bizarre conspiracy about First Lady Melania Trump’s disappearance, even though he knew a CNBC reporter had seen her at the White House a few days earlier.

Following the unraveling of Empire star Jussie Smollet’s claim about being assaulted by two homophobic, racist Trump supporters last month in Chicago, Stelter is now spreading falsehoods in an effort to defend the media’s appalling coverage of the case.

Appearing on CNN’s basement-rated New Day with co-hosts John Avlon and Alisyn Camerota on Monday, Stelter said of the Smollett case: “There was a rush to judgment, I think it was mostly in the celebrity press and among activists and among Twitter people. I think it was a really careful reporting by news organizations. But it all gets lumped in together at the end of the day.”

It makes sense for Stelter to muddy the waters like this. After all, the Smollett hoax comes fresh on the heels of the media’s starring role in the Racist Covington High School Hoax, the Brett Kavanaugh Serial-Rapist Hoax, and most of all, the imploding Trump Colluded With Russia Hoax.

Unfortunately for Stelter, his shameless spin is easily exposed as such by countless tweets, headlines, and statements made by his fellow journalists and pundits — including four high-profile staffers at CNN.

Let’s start with videotape of a CNN anchor: “Absolutely despicable,” said CNN’s Brooke Baldwin on CNN Newsroom, “and this is America in 2019.”

CNN anchor Don Lemon said the following on a popular podcast: “One, he has to deal with discrimination as a black man,” said Lemon, “then, on top of that, he has to be gay — and then, fame — fame is not natural — When something happens to you and it’s controversial, everyone is coming for you, and so I knew everyone would be picking apart his story.”

CNN’s April Ryan still hasn’t deleted this tweet: “This attack on @JussieSmollett is a hate crime and should be treated as such!”

This attack on @JussieSmollett is a hate crime and should be treated as such! https://t.co/X7nvpycpiL — AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) January 29, 2019

CNN’s Ana Navarro did finally delete this tweet: “I saw Jussie Smollett in Miami last week. I can’t believe this happened. It is sad, disgusting, and deplorable.”

And then, in CNN’s own reporting on the story, a headline blared: “‘Empire’ actor victim of racist and homophobic assault.” Any attribution to police or Smollett was relegated to the text. Anyone who shared that CNN link was putting out the narrative that A) it was an established fact that the attack occurred and B) it was an established fact that the attack was a hate crime.

There are countless other examples:

PBS NewsHour White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor: “We have to do better as a country. This is disgusting,” she wrote in a tweet.

A tweet from New York Post staff writer Zachary Kussin (now deleted): “I also hate when cops investigate this kind of blatant shit as a ‘possible hate crime.’ This is obviously a hate crime.”

BuzzFeed’s Ryan Schocket:

Daily Beast senior writer Kevin Fallon:

People in MAGA hats recognized and then beat and poured bleach on Jussie Smollett, calling him that “faggot” from Empire. Anyone who thinks supporting You Know Who isn’t tantamount to providing artillery for weaponized bigotry needs to take a hard look in the mirror. — Kevin Fallon (@kpfallon) January 29, 2019

This last one is especially ironic because as Stelter spread his lie, he did so in front of John Avlon, who used to run the Daily Beast. Naturally, Avlon said nothing.

Stelter also said nothing when Vox’s Liz Plank appeared as a guest on his weekend show Reliable Sources and offered the same excuse about the media’s Smollett coverage. She claimed no one in the media treated Smollett’s allegation as true (see the above tweets), even though she herself, on at least three occasions, retweeted others who treated the allegation as true:

Here are the three #JussieSmollett tweets that I can find that @feministabulous RT'd in the early days of the reporting on the incident: pic.twitter.com/PnwVFBh5xj — Jeryl Bier (@JerylBier) February 17, 2019

Here Plank is, personally, on CNN lying about her own irresponsible behavior regarding her role in using retweets to spread a hoax.

Moreover, those who did dare to express a healthy skepticism about Smollett’s sketchy allegation, like Donald Trump Jr., were attacked as “conspiracy theorist” by the media.

Stelter’s lying is to be expected, but it’s still important to set the record straight when fake news tries to gaslight all of America.

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault."

Sharpton did not define what he meant by “maximum,” but filing a false policy report is a felony in Illinois and punishable by up to three years in prison, “GMA” reported earlier on Monday.

The MSNBC host however clearly stated that he was waiting for all the facts to come in and that whoever was at fault should face justice.

“I among many others when hearing of the reports said the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum. I still maintain that,” he said. “Let’s not act like this is some left wing hoax that some are saying on social media. President Trump called this horrible and he’s certainly not a left winger.”

On Jan. 29, Smollett first reported the attack to police saying that two men in MAGA hats and ski masks attacked him early in the morning near a Subway sandwich shop, shouting racial slurs and the line, “This is MAGA country.” For weeks, however, cops struggled to crack the case. Two persons of interest identified and arrested by the police were later released.

Reps for the Chicago PD told TheWrap Monday that they were “not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

In a weekend statement, attorneys for the actor, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, strongly denied the reporting from CNN and elsewhere saying Smollett “has been further victimized” by the claims.

You've likely heard the story by now. African-American actor Smollett says he was attacked at 2 a.m. in sub-zero weather on a street in Chicago. The alleged attackers yelled ""This is MAGA country!"" while pouring bleach on Smollett and attempting to tie a rope around his neck.

This fantastic story deserved scrutiny from the start. Despite the obvious question of why anyone would attempt such a thing during a polar vortex, the story begs a few basic journalistic questions as well: Why didn't any of the ubiquitous cameras around Chicago capture any of this attack on video? Why couldn't anyone corroborate this story?

No matter. National media outlets ran with the desired narrative: Smollett was absolutely attacked by supporters of President Trump Donald John TrumpSouth Korea slams Bolton book as 'distorting the reality' of nuclear talks Democrats face tough questions with Bolton Protesters try to bring down statue of Andrew Jackson near White House MORE. Full stop.

But one very important word was missing from the screaming headlines and from the content itself: ""Alleged.""

Because, without that very keyword, the attack and its context is presented to the reader or viewer as undisputed reality. Given the questions around the story and complete lack of evidence, the story deserved to be characterized as alleged until a foundation of facts could be gathered.

From there, things got even more questionable when Smollett initially refused to hand his phone over to police. This was key, because Smollett said he immediately called his manager, Brandon Moore, right after the attack. For his part, Moore also would not allow his phone to be turned over.

Smollett eventually did supply the Chicago Police Department his phone records, but they for whatever reason were heavily redacted.

But the stories portraying Smollett as the victim and portraying Trump supporters as the racist villains went mostly unabated on the national level. That wasn't the case among most local news outlets in Chicago, which covered the story with the caution and scrutiny it deserved.

National politicians, including those running for president, also blew through the due process stop sign.

Smollett contends he was targeted by two Trump supporters, who verbally and physically accosted him as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago on January 29. The actor says the men called him a “f*****” and a “n*****,” tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him, and kicked him in the ribs.

The suspicious “hate crime” account by Smollett, however, has just about fallen apart based on new evidence. Police sources have told reporters that Smollett hired two Nigerian men to stage the attack. The actor has also reportedly been resistant to full cooperation with authorities, such as waiting a full two weeks to turn over “limited and heavily redacted” phone records meant to corroborate his account.

Top Democrats, such as House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), media darling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and presidential hopefuls Sen. Cory Booker (D-NY) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), swiftly posted uncritical tweets regarding Smollett’s suspicious account of the attack, in a clear effort to help push a beneficial partisan narrative, which is essentially: “President Trump and his deplorable supporters are unleashing hate on marginalized groups and must be stopped!”

Here are just some of the tweets from these top Democrats that have aged poorly, to put it mildly:

House Speaker Pelosi wrote: “The racist, homophobic attack on [Jussie Smollett] is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once and for all.”

Pelosi has since deleted the tweet without explanation or follow-up. It’s unclear if Pelosi, for example, still wants justice to be served if Smollett really did orchestrate the attack.

Rep. Ocasio-Cortex (D-NY): “There is no such thing as ‘racially charged.’ This attack was not ‘possibly’ homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack. If you don’t like what is happening to our country, then work to change it. It is no one’s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes.”

Host Tim Young posted top Democrats’ hasty reactions to the alleged hate crime against Smollett, which has essentially fallen apart now, in one tweet:"
164,https://www.dailywire.com/news/43607/despite-evidence-some-prominent-people-still-stand-paul-bois,,"Despite The Evidence, Some Prominent People Still Stand By Jussie Smollett",[],https://www.dailywire.com/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/uploads/2019/02/smollettgala.jpg?itok=KicqU5ck,"['despite', 'crime', 'stand', 'alleged', 'prominent', 'believe', 'evidence', 'know', 'mahoney', 'chicago', 'twitter', 'smollett', 'empire', 'jussie']","Now that the alleged crime that “Empire” star Jussie Smollett claims happened to him looks more and more like a fabricated hoax, his friends and allies have begun to either backtrack on their initial support, hold their condemnations, or double-down on their defense of the actor.

According to USA Today, Smollett has at least one prominent supporter still publicly holding out hope that police will eventually exonerate him of having committed a hoax hate crime: Brett Mahoney, Executive Producer of “Empire.”

“I believe and stand by @JussieSmollett,” Mahoney tweeted on Sunday night. “Keep your head up.”

It appears that the “Empire” writing staff may agree with Mahoney, due to the fact his tweet of support was later shared on the “Empire” writers’ official Twitter account.

When the alleged hate crime against Smollett first broke, Mahoney was just one of many Hollywood and political figures who accepted the actor’s account at face-value, despite the lack of facts verifying his initial story.

“The attack on Jussie, because he is such a beloved member of our family, hurt us all very hard. Jussie is a proud, gay black man,” he said. “I don’t know whether the cowards who attacked him were trying to beat the gay, the black or the pride out of him, but that’s impossible, because he’s strong. And so we’re happy that he is back at work.”

Over the weekend, “social justice”-centric filmmaker Ava DuVernay (“A Wrinkle In Time”) initially expressed reservations about Chicago P.D.’s claim that the investigation had shifted into whether or not Smollett paid off two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack.

“Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD,” she tweeted. “The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

After some blowback from her Twitter followers, DuVernay clarified that Smollett “might have lied,” adding that she “never believes police on general principle.”

“Yessir. I hear you. And agree,” she replied. “I wrote (that there) are inconsistencies. He might have lied. He might be not have. I don’t know. But what I do know? I never believe police on general principle just ‘cause they say so. My experience, our history, makes it impossible for me to do so.”

Other random trolls on Twitter have echoed DuVernay’s sentiment by putting forth the conspiracy theory that the Chicago P.D. is trying to frame Smollett in the same way it was alleged that the L.A.P.D. tried to frame the previously alleged — and subsequently acquitted — murderer O.J. Simpson.

Speaking on his program “Politics Nation” over the weekend, Rev. Al Sharpton rejected the notion that the media trumped up Smollett’s charge, while admitting that the actor should face tough penalties if he did stage the attack as alleged.

“I among many others, when hearing of the reports, said that the reports were horrific and we should come with all that we can come with in order for us to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,” Sharpton told viewers. “I still maintain that. And, if it is found that Smollett and the gentlemen did, in some way, perpetrate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.”"

Law official sources reported the case could be headed to a grand jury sometime this week, according to TMZ Sunday. Law enforcement is allegedly making sure Smollett is not in contact with the two Nigerian brothers who were first arrested Wednesday and subsequently released Friday.

The Daily Caller News Foundation contacted the Chicago Police Department (CPD) Monday to confirm if Smollett’s case was headed to a grand jury.

“We do not have that information at this point,” Jennifer Bryk of CPD said to TheDCNF over email.

Rafer Weigel of Fox 32 tweeted Monday that CPD said Smollett’s case could go to a grand jury if the “Empire” actor does not “voluntarily come in for questioning.”

“CPD says “it’s certainly possible” #JussieSmollett case could go to Grand Jury but “that’s way too premature,” Weigel tweeted. “May be a last resort if #Smollett doesn’t voluntarily come in for questioning. CPD says #Smollett’s lawyers have given no indication he will despite several requests.”

Smollett reported he was attacked, doused with an unknown chemical substance, had a rope tied around his neck and two men who yelled “This is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country” at him on Jan. 29. (RELATED: Vox Correspondent Says ‘MAGA Country’ Quote In Smollett Case Was Pushed By Celebrities Not The Media)

There have been reports, however, that the attack was staged by Smollett and the two brothers were allegedly paid to help, according to CNN.

Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement Sunday saying such claims were “nothing further from the truth.”

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement Sunday to TheDCNF. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Pugh, Henderson and Smollett’s crisis manager Anne Kavanagh did not immediately respond to TheDCNF’s request for comment.

She told CNN's Brian Stelter, ""I remember in the hours right after this happened that CNN, that our bosses were advising to pump the brakes a little bit because there were things already that didn't add up. I was frankly surprised how many people jumped on board to side with Jussie Smollett before there were photos, before there were police statements, before all that stuff.""

Stelter pointed his ""rush to judgment"" finger at ""activists, actors, Hollywood celebrities, friends of Smollett, [and] Democratic presidential candidates"" along with the ""celebrity press"" — but not at the mainstream news media, who he said did ""really careful reporting.""

<br>

'Really careful reporting'?

Maybe Camerota and Stelter should have a chat with their colleague, CNN's Brooke Baldwin.

Because on the day the alleged attack hit the news cycle, Baldwin was on air speaking to CNN's national correspondent Ryan Young in Chicago — and Baldwin uttered a few words that some just might say gave early credence to it all.

At the end of the segment — after Young indicated detectives were in the process of gathering information on the alleged attack that we've now learned has been called into serious question — Baldwin paused, shook her head ever so slightly, and announced, ""This is America in 2019.""

<br>

The same day, in another segment between the two, Young gave a monologue of sorts on the alleged attack:

""But this is kind of a shock. And we've seen, of course, the buzz on social media surrounding this case. But then when you think about the idea on top of that — the idea that racial slurs and maybe even some of the homophobic slurs being used toward him — you can see how serious this crime is right now. A lot of the people who work in this industry also live in this part of the town, so you can understand the concern even as we've been talking to people in this area. There's been a sharp reaction to this crime. Hopefully we'll learn more from police in the next few hours ... been giving them calls to figure out exactly what detectives have so far, maybe a vehicle description or some sort of build. Don't have any of that information so far, but it'll be interesting to see how this plays out.""

To that Baldwin replied, ""Absolutely despicable.""



So, ""this is America in 2019"" and it's ""absolutely despicable""?

Sure sounds a lot like we-know-exactly-what-happened language. And offered to help CNN viewers do what exactly? Make up their minds before the bulk of facts came in?

What else?

Since the Smollett case took major turns Friday and over the weekend, the actor lawyered up — and his attorneys denied their client was part of some hoax.



They said in a statement:

As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.



One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.



Jussie and his attorney's anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At present time, Jussie and his attorney's have no inclination to respond to '""unnamed"" sources inside the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels."

When news first broke on January 29, it was reported that Smollett (who is Black and gay) was the victim of what looked to be a racist and homophobic hate crime. Since then, rumours, limited police statements and other developments have muddied the waters and taken the whole case in a disturbing direction.

What we thought we knew

The alleged attack was first reported to police by Smollett’s manager in the wee-hours of Tuesday, January 29. Over the course of the following day, news outlets learned and reported that Smollett had been walking to his apartment in downtown Chicago when two masked men approached him and started beating him, yelling racist and homophobic slurs and finishing by pouring an unknown liquid on him and tying a noose-like rope around his neck. Smollett also said the two individuals told him, “This is MAGA country,” suggesting they were Trump supporters.

Police assured the outraged public that they were taking the investigation seriously, starting with a threatening letter sent to Smollett at the Fox studio where he films Empire. Smollett sat down for an interview with police as part of the investigation. In an update two days later, the department released images of two “persons of interest” in the case and appealed to the public for help identifying them.

It was assumed by the general public that the attack was a hate crime and Smollett received overwhelming support on social media and from celebrities. He thanked everyone for their love and went on to perform at a previously scheduled concert the following weekend.

Rumours took over

Recently, details have gotten a little sketchy. Last week, police asked Smollett to turn over phone files in aid of the investigation. The actor provided heavily redacted records that were so inscrutable, police called them insufficient for a criminal investigation.

Smollett defended the redacted material, issuing a statement through his lawyers explaining it was “intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.” But that didn’t stop the rumour mill from kicking into overdrive.

The redacted files plus the admission by police that they were not able to find surveillance footage of the attack (Chicago has an incredibly sophisticated surveillance network) led to the generation of rumours that Smollett hadn’t actually been attacked.

Two Chicago media outlets reported last week that “multiple sources” had confirmed to them police were investigating whether Smollett’s attack was staged. There was a coinciding rumour that Fox had been planning to write Smollett’s character off Empire prior and the attack was a career move orchestrated by Smollett.

Both these rumours were refuted by official sources at the end of the week. Fox assured in a statement that Smollett is a “core” of the show and rumours they were writing him off were “patently ridiculous.”

Chicago police also said in a statement that the attack being “a hoax” was yet “unconfirmed by case detectives.” They also contacted the news outlets that first reported the rumours to refute the claims, calling those sources “uninformed and inaccurate.”

Wait, are they rumours?

Shortly after police said that the source reports were unsubstantiated, they commented further that they would like to re-interview Smollett himself after interrogations of two individuals who were considered persons of interest resulted in “new evidence.”

While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident. pic.twitter.com/b9GgXbSUt9 — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 17, 2019

The individuals in question were reported to be two Nigerian brothers who were thought to be in the area at the time of the crime and had purchased rope prior to the attack. The brothers’ lawyer told media that both the individuals knew Smollett from working on Empire. Police questioned the brothers for two days before releasing them without charges over the weekend.

Did Smollett orchestrate his attack?

Monday morning, CNN reported with input from “two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation” that Chicago police believe Smollett orchestrated his attack by paying two men to assault him. The report suggests that the two brothers who were interrogated by police said in their interview that they were hired to carry out the fake attack.

The Chicago police have not yet responded to the new information.

Here comes the judgement

The new uncertainty has spurned backlash and intense emotions in a number of directions. While some commenters online are outraged at the apparent dishonesty and using the developments to disregard the prevalence of hate crimes, others are taking a more nuanced approach. Many are warning that one instance of dishonesty does not mean that real instances of crimes like these are not disturbingly frequent. Feminist activist Roxane Gay expressed the confusion many are feeling right now in a series of tweets.

How would do something like this? Why would he think the police wouldn’t investigate? Why would he make it harder for people who actually suffer from hate crimes? It makes no sense. The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him. — roxane gay (@rgay) February 17, 2019

It’s all a goddamned shame. I hope Smollett gets the help he must very much need. I hope he comes to realize the damage he has done and atones for it somehow. What a mess. What a travesty. — roxane gay (@rgay) February 17, 2019

And I have not one regrets about believing him. I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered because more often than not they are telling the truth. — roxane gay (@rgay) February 17, 2019

Others are willing to stand by the star. Empire executive producer Brett Mahoney tweeted that he believes and stands by Smollett. The tweet was re-tweeted by the Empire Writers‘ official account.

Ava DuVernay, who was one of the first celebrities to express support for Smollett back in January, wrote that though she understands there are inconsistencies, she “can’t blindly believe Chicago PD.” Good Morning America host Robin Roberts — who sat down with Smollett for his first interview after the attack — reminded viewers Monday that the police had initially found Smollett credible.

Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t. — Ava DuVernay (@ava) February 17, 2019

Yessir. I hear you. And agree. I wrote thatthere are inconsistencies. He might have lied. He might be not have. I don’t know. But what I do know? I never believe police on general principle just ‘cause they say so. My experience, our history, makes it impossible for me to do so. — Ava DuVernay (@ava) February 17, 2019

Still, some are withholding judgement until there are further developments. U.S. Senator Cory Brooker (who recently announced a 2020 presidential run) told reporters he wouldn’t be commenting until more information was made public.

Sen. Cory Booker responds to Jussie Smollett reports: “The information is still coming out.

As easy as it is to form an opinion based on speculation and these bombshell reports, with no comment yet from police, this case is still a mystery — though a convoluted and fraught one."

Cardi B says she thinks Smollett is ""really f--ked up"" if it turns out he was lying.

Celebrities and politicians are reacting to new developments regarding Jussie Smollett's alleged attack last month.

Chicago police released a statement on Saturday confirming a pivot in the direction of their investigation due to interviewing two Nigerian brothers, who were once suspects. ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to the press.

The two brothers were released on Friday without charges, and were said to no longer be suspects. Chicago PD have not officially clarified what that new direction for the case will be.

Two law enforcement sources told CNN that CPD are now operating under the belief that Smollett paid the two brothers, who he knew from ""Empire,"" to orchestrate an assault on him, however this has not been confirmed by law enforcement.

Attorneys for Smollett claimed that the actor felt ""victimized"" by the various media reports claiming he may have been involved in orchestrating his own attack. ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" a widely circulated statement to the press read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Last month, Smollett claimed he had been attacked by two masked men who shouted racist and anti-gay slurs -- in addition to yelling ""this is MAGA country"" -- before he was viciously beaten and had a chemical poured on him.

When the alleged attack was widely reported, politicians and celebrities voiced outrage over the apparent hate crime.

Since the new developments in the case most celebrities have remained silent. However, Cardi B spoke out about it during an Instagram Live Sunday night. The hip-hop star said Smollett is ""really f--ked up"" if it turns out he was lying.

""I don't want to completely blame him because somebody I was talking to, they said like you know police in Chicago are racist, so they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he's a liar. But if he's not then bro you f--ked up for real like why would you did that? Like you don't have to do that. Then you give f--king Donald Trump immunity to f--kng laugh at n----s and shit and make motherf---kers look bad.""

""So I don't want to -- you know -- call Jussie Smollett a complete lie, but they do claim that they have evidence from both the brothers that they spoke [out],"" she added. ""So I don't know, I want to see what else. I want to see, I want to know because if he did that he really f--ked up bro. This February, you had so many people standing for you. Like why would you do that bro? Is attention that necessary for y'all now days?""

Meanwhile, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi quietly deleted a tweet she sent out on January 29th, according to Business Insider, stating: ""The racist, homophobic attack on [Smollett] is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery [and] that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once [and] for all.""

While Senator Cory Booker, who had called Smollett's alleged attack ""an attempted modern-day lynching,"" told reporters over the weekend that he will decline to comment on the case developments for the time being. ""I'm going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources,"" the New Jersey Senator told reporters, according to CNN.

""The Ellen Show's"" EP Andy Lassner tweeted, ""Seems like Jussie Smollett has lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of explaining to do.""

Similarly, Rev. Al Sharpton said on MSNBC Sunday night that Smollett should face ""accountability to the maximum"" if it's discovered he orchestrated the attack.

""I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come within law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,"" Sharpton said on his show ""PoliticsNation."" ""I still maintain that and if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.""

However, blockbuster director Ava DuVernay made it clear she remained skeptical about law enforcement.

""Despite the inconsistencies, I can't blindly believe Chicago PD,"" DuVernay tweeted. ""The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I'll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won't stop me from believing others. It can't.""

In response, a person replied that although they ""respect"" DuVernay, they believe Smollett's entire case was ""fishy from the start."" ""What famous person goes out in sub zero weather at 2am for subway, alone? Then, he wore the rope around his neck back to the hotel and walked past the guard at hotel.""

""Yessir. I hear you. And agree,"" DuVernay said back to the user. ""I wrote that there are inconsistencies. He might have lied. He might be [sic] not have. I don't know. But what I do know? I never believe police on general principle just 'cause they say so. My experience, our history, makes it impossible for me to do so.""

As evidence mounts that Smollett may have paid two acquaintances to carry out the alleged racist and homophobic attack that created a wave of media attention, even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has revoked her sympathies.

Back on January 29, when word of Smollett’s ordeal first broke, Pelosi tweeted, “The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.” As initially reported by Business Insider, that tweet has now been deleted.

Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, confirmed that the tweet was intentionally taken down. “As the Speaker who passed the fully inclusive Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, we spoke out because this appeared to be a deeply troubling incident of violence motivated against vulnerable communities,” Hammill told me. “Given the turn in the investigation, we decided to no longer amplify the original accusation. Following the conclusion of the ongoing investigation, we will comment further. We should all be united in fighting racism and homophobia.”

Last week, the Chicago Police Department arrested brothers Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo on suspicion of involvement in the attack, only to release the pair days later citing “new evidence.” It has since emerged that the Osundairo brothers occasionally associated with Smollett in their work on the Empire set, and the police have stated that their interrogation produced information that “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” Smollett’s attorneys have vehemently denied their client staged the attack, though the star has not yet agreed to a follow-up interview requested by Chicago police.

As of yet, few notable figures have explicitly revoked their support for Smollett. Empire showrunner Brett Mahoney tweeted on Sunday, “I believe and stand by @JussieSmollett. Keep your head up,” while director Ava DuVernay called into question the Chicago police department’s trustworthiness.

Conservative figures have capitalized on questions surrounding the case, which was originally said to involve suspects wearing “Make America Great Again” hats and shouting “This is MAGA Country!” (Smollett denied making those claims). Donald Trump Jr. spent a portion of Sunday tweeting at celebrities and political figures including Kamala Harris to revoke their support for Smollett, though Pelosi wasn’t among his targets."

A homemade 'flying scooter', made by a maverick Chinese inventor, has taken to the skies with its creator on board.

Zhao Deli, 40, made another trip on the drone after the maiden journey took place last month in Tangxia town, Dongguan city, south China's Guangdong province.

The contraption is powered by eight propellers and Mr Zhao says it will be available to customers for between £4,330 - £5,700 ($5,500 and $7,200) next year.

He has named the drone Jin Dou Yun or Magical Cloud - a flying cloud ridden by China's very own fictional superhero, Monkey King.

The inventor from Dongguan in southern China has invested heavily in his project, which so far has yielded just one prototype.

Mr Zhao claims the project is yet to be completed and the machine is still missing its outer shell.

According to the inventor, mass production will begin next year, with the ambitious entrepreneur hoping it will be available overseas in the future.

Mr Zhao designed and built the drone himself and - dressed in an all-black protective suit - embarked on the extraordinary manned flight on the 1,560th attempt launch of the bike.

The drone's propellers are affixed to a central frame which is designed to be as lightweight as possible.

The aircraft has a motor installed under the seat, which provides the power for the drone while the rider perches at the top.

With the eight propellers stirring the air and the motor roaring, the flying vehicle successfully carried him into the air.

After a safe landing onto the ground, the excited Mr Zhao told a reporter from Guangzhou Daily: 'It was like riding a motorbike in the sky.

'My dream has come true after this 1560th flight test.'

Inspiration for the project came from Chinese fictional character 'Monkey King' and after Mr Zhao had read about hoverboards

A video on Chinese news site Sohu shows the man leaning forward with his hands on a control panel at the front of his contraption.

Seconds later, all eight propellers start to spin and lift Mr Zhao into the air.

The man-carrying quadcopter levitates in the sky and lands safely on the ground.

Mr Zhao claimed the flying bike could carry a load of between 110 and 220 pounds (50 and 100 kilograms).

Its maximum takeoff weight of 564 pounds (256 kilograms), top speed of 44 mph (70 km/h) and battery life of 30 minutes make it a market leader, said Mr Zhao.

Mr Zhao was born in a village in south China's Hunan Province. Like most boys, he has always dreamt of flying in the sky one day.

He aced in science subjects at school and enjoyed fixing electrical appliances at home.

The inventor was ecstatic after Monday's flight.

He said he hoped to fly across China's Yellow River on the aircraft.

He also planned to modify the 'flying motorbike' before launching it as a commercial product on the market.

Scandal-plagued President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump put on brave faces and even showed slight affection while hosting their Japanese counterparts, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and his wife, Akie Abe, for dinner at Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach on Tuesday.

The two couples appeared relaxed as they took a casual stroll across the lawn of President Trump’s Florida resort.

Melania appeared unfazed by the headlines that have been swirling around her husband's alleged infidelity.

The dinner date was happening as the news media reported that the president's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has been the subject of a federal investigation.

Authorities are taking particular interest in payments he made supposedly on Trump's behalf to two women with whom his boss had a sexual relationship.

When seated at dinner, Melania Trump was seated next to the Japanese premier, while her husband, the president, sat next to Mrs. Abe.

President Trump, seated next to Japanese First Lady Akie Abe, says the United States has engaged in 'extremely high level' talks with North Korea and hinted they go all the way up to reclusive dictator Kim Jong-un

The president met the Japanese leader away from frigid Washington, DC – where temperatures struggled to climb out of the 40s on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, at Palm Beach, the high temperature for the day reached 80 degrees. By evening, it had cooled off to a pleasant 69 degrees Fahrenheit.

Pleasantries aside, President Trump and Prime Minister Abe had some serious business to discuss during their planned two-day summit.

Trump said on Tuesday that the United States has engaged in 'extremely high level' talks with North Korea and hinted they go all the way up to reclusive dictator Kim Jong-un.

Asked by reporters this evening who the senior officials are and if he'd spoken directly to 'him,' Trump said, 'yes.'

He rolled back the apparent confirmation that he'd talked to Kim a few minutes later in another encounter with press, creating confusion about what he'd meant.

'Well let's leave it a little bit short of that,' Trump said of direct talks with Kim the second time around.

'But we have talks at the highest level, and it's going very well, but we'll see what happens.'

Trump was most likely referring to Mike Pompeo, the outgoing head of the Central Intelligence Agency who was nominated by the president to succeeded Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.

The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Pompeo met secretly with Kim over the Easter holiday.

The president was most likely referring to his CIA director, Mike Pompeo (left), who is reported to have paid a secret visit to North Korea over the Easter holiday and met personally with Kim (right)

After Trump's remarks sparked speculation about him meeting Kim, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders immediately sent out a statement clarifying that the talks were not with Kim himself.

'The President said the administration has had talks at the highest levels and added that they were not with him directly,' she said.

The president did not, however, tell reporters that the talks weren't with Kim. He merely said, 'Let's leave it a little bit short of that.'

Earlier on Tuesday the president said a face-to-face meeting with Kim is still on track to take place in the next few weeks.

Unless negotiations go offer the rails, Trump said the meeting will take place in late May or early June in one of five undisclosed locations he said are under consideration.

'We have had direct talks at very high levels, extremely high levels, with North Korea. I really believe there’s a lot of good will,' the U.S. president said. 'We’ll see what happens, as I always say. Because ultimately it’s the end result that counts.'

Trump said Japan and the US are 'locked and we are very unified' when it comes to North Korea.

He delivered the remarks after welcoming Abe to his Palm Beach property for an afternoon meeting that both he and the Japanese leader said yielded great progress on the trade and security issues at hand.

'On those two points, we actually successfully forged a mutual understanding,' Abe said. 'So I'm very happy to see the outcome of our one-on-one discussion.'

An intimate meal with Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Abe will serve a capstone to expanded talks between the president and prime minister and their chief advisers this afternoon. They will pick up talks Wednesday and potentially play a round of golf. The summit will apex with a joint press conference.

'I am in Florida and looking forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Working on Trade and Military Security,' the president tweeted this morning.

Today's summit is the U.S. president's second time hosting Abe since he took office at the private club the Trump family continues to own and operate for profit. The ultra-wealthy president has bestowed only one other world leader, China's Xi Jinping, with a Mar-a-Lago invite.

'Many of the world’s great leaders request to come to Mar-a-Lago and Palm Beach. They like it; I like it. We’re comfortable,' Trump commented on Tuesday as he sat down for his first meeting with Abe. 'Many, many people want to be here. Many of the leaders want to be here. They request specifically.'

Trump signaled to Abe with the comment that he continues to hold the Japanese prime minister battling his own set of political scandals in high esteem.

'It's honor to have you in Florida with us. It’s an honor to have you at Mar-a-Lago and an honor to have you in the United States. It’s really something special,' Trump told him.

Abe and Trump have much to discuss since their last face-to-face meeting in November in Tokyo.

Last month, Trump agreed to a detente with North Korea in exchange for a pledge from that the communist regime that it would freeze its nuclear program.

He also announced sweeping new tariffs on steel and aluminum. The Trump administration ultimately gave some countries an exemption, but Japan, which does not have a trade deal with the U.S., was not one of them.

Japan would have benefited from a 12-nation pact that Trump's predecessor was pursuing with the help of Republicans in Congress. Trump bucked his party and the deal, however, and yanked the U.S. out last year on the assurance that he could engineer a better one.

Eleven other nations inked an agreement without the U.S. in March. In a decision that suggested the U.S. was looking to join the pact as a counterweight to China, Trump last week directed his trade representative and his chief economic advisor to reopen the negotiations.

Senior Trump administration officials said Tuesday that the purpose of the Abe visit, form the U.S. standpoint at least, is to get on the same page about North Korea.

Larry Kudlow, the president's National Economic Council chairman, admitted there are also 'certain disagreements with respect to some of the trading issues' that needed to be worked out, as well.

'We'll iron those out, hopefully,' he told reporters. 'The United States would probably like to see a free trade agreement come out at some point with Japan.'

Trump made Tokyo the first stop on November trip to Asia. He and Abe bonded over burgers, a golf game and hats that the Japanese prime minister had made for the occasion said 'Donald & Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater'

In the past Trump and Abe have used golf to bridge the divide, however, an hours-long game wasn't expected to take place this time

At a briefing Friday, a senior administration official insisted the relationship between Abe and Trump is as good as it has ever been.

The leaders have been 'in constant contact' since the president accepted Kim's invitation to meet, the person insisted.

'The President has a great deal of respect for Prime Minister Abe’s views on Northeast Asian security. He will certainly want to know what additional thoughts Prime Minister Abe has beyond those that he’s already shared,' the official added.

Abe commended Trump on Tuesday for having the 'courage' to meet with Kim.

Still, he said he wanted to 'underscore the importance of achieving the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization, as well as the abandonment of missile programs of North Korea' in their talks today.

Trump said in a March 10 tweet that he'd spoken to Abe and the Japanese was 'very enthusiastic about talks with North Korea.'

'Also discussing opening up Japan to much better trade with the U.S. Currently have a massive $100 Billion Trade Deficit. Not fair or sustainable. It will all work out!' he optimistically said.

After his first round of talks with Abe on Tuesday, Trump agreed that a good deal of progress on the military, trade and North Korea had already come about.

Kim is scheduled to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in next Friday. A conversation with Trump is on track for late May or early June.

'It's a working visit, and the focus is, really, on the discussion of those high-priority issues that I mentioned,' the senior official previewing the summit said. 'Golf is not on the official schedule.'

'I think there’ll be great respect paid by both parties and hopefully we’ll be able to make a deal on the de-nuking of North Korea,' Trump last week said. 'Hopefully, it’ll be a relationship that’s much different than it’s been for many, many years.'

The White House said Friday as it previewed the Abe summit that the Japanese PM had never asked Trump not to meet with Kim.

'I don’t want to go into their private conversations,' the U.S. official said, 'but Prime Minister Abe has very, very good ideas and advice that he’ll be sharing.'

Abe rushed to New York after Trump's election, becoming the first world leader to meet with the president-in-waiting. On the occasion of Trump's election, Abe gifted him with a gold golf driver in a nod to their shared love of the sport.

In a symbol of the close friendship they he and Abe have developed, Trump made Tokyo the first stop on November trip to Asia. He and Abe bonded over burgers, a golf game and hats that the Japanese prime minister had made for the occasion said 'Donald & Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater.'

But since then, Trump has softened his approach toward Kim, the 33-year-old tyrant he used to needle as 'Little Rocket Man.' The U.S. is also yet to ink the trade deal with Japan that Abe has been pursing since Trump was elected.

Abe's approval ratings at home have steadily eroded as he battles corruption allegations, and an announcement on trade would help him shore up support in Japan.

Since he and Abe bonded over burgers, Trump has softened his approach toward Kim, the 33-year-old tyrant he used to needle as 'Little Rocket Man.' The U.S. is also yet to ink the trade deal with Japan that Abe has been pursing since Trump was elected

Trump appeared open to a deal heading into the summit as he instructed his senior aides to see what could be done about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

'He now believes that the United States would consider negotiating with TPP countries, either individually or as a group, if it’s in the interest of American business and American workers,' a senior official said Friday.

'So I think it’s fair to say, and the President has said, that a deal would have to be very attractive from those standpoints for the US to take another look at TPP.'

In a tweet on Thursday evening, President Trump said he was standing firm on the reasons he ditched the pact in the first place, though.

'Would only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to Pres. Obama,' he said.

'We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP, and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations, Japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years!'

Trump's chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, told Fox & Friends Tuesday morning that the administration would 'go slow' on TPP and 'report back to him.'

In the past Trump and Abe have used golf to bridge the divide.

An hours-long game wasn't originally on the schedule this time.

Trump said Tuesday that he and Abe would try to 'sneak' a game in, though, before the conclusion of the PM's visit.

'It's a working visit, and the focus is, really, on the discussion of those high-priority issues that I mentioned,' the senior official previewing the summit said of a golf game on Friday.

'Golf is not on the official schedule.'

The president said Tuesday afternoon that he and Abe would try to hit the links on Wednesday am after all.

'We're going to sneak out tomorrow morning and play a round of golf, if possible, and if we have the time,' Trump said.

Trump recalled his last golf game with Abe. In Tokyo they played alongside Japanese pro golfer Hideki Matsuyama.

''He’s one of the top three or four golfers in the world,' Trump said Tuesday. 'And I always thought I was OK at golf, but then I realized, we’re not so good,' he told Abe."

(Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)

His case involves implausibility piled upon implausibility.

The “we reported the Jussie Smollett case responsibly” contention has been blasted to smithereens. Twitter accounts and headlines in the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times reported as fact Jussie Smollett’s wildly implausible allegations, and many other journalists did so as well, not to mention the innumerable activists and celebrities who piled on. So, a question for all of the above. Why did you believe Jussie Smollett? Let’s try to catalogue the red flags.

Had you ever heard of Jussie Smollett before the alleged January 29 attack? Do you think it likely that fans of President Trump had? Smollett has said that his public anti-Trump statements were the likely reason for the attack. Is it really true that he was an especially prominent anti-Trump voice? Did you think it strange that Smollett or his representatives were, from the beginning, telling TMZ a different story than they told the police? He or his representatives told TMZ the attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country.” This was news to the police. Related to (4), don’t you think that if Smollett’s supposed attackers had yelled, “This is MAGA country,” he would have told the police in his initial interview with them, right after the alleged assault? How did Trump-loving racist homophobes know that Smollett would be at a Subway sandwich shop at 2 a.m. ? Smollett has said going to the Subway was a spur-of-the-moment decision. It was extremely cold in Chicago the night of January 29. Assuming Trump-loving racist homophobes wanted to track down and attack Smollett, and maybe knew where he lived, as the shop was close to his apartment, wouldn’t they have waited for more agreeable weather? How likely do you think it is that attackers would shout, “This is MAGA country” in Chicago, a place that no one thinks is MAGA country? If Smollett’s supposed attackers did not know he was going to be at that exact spot at that exact moment and would have been willing to attack any random gay and/or black man in Chicago, how difficult would it have been for them to find a gay and/or black man to assault without going to the trouble of a 2 a .m. attack on a frigid night? Couldn’t they have just waited outside a gay bar on a summer night? Don’t you think for the attackers to have yelled a racist slur as well as a homophobic slur as well as having a bottle of bleach as well as having a noose sounds a bit overdetermined, like bad television writing? Smollett supposedly received a viciously nasty letter threatening him with lynching a week before the alleged assault. Is it likely that either two separate racist parties wanted to attack him at essentially the same time or else the January 29 attackers would telegraph their intentions with a letter? Don’t you think it strange that Smollett had a phone with him, yet didn’t call the police on that phone to inform them what had happened and which way his attackers had fled? Don’t you think it strange that his attackers fled without much harming Smollett or robbing him? Related to (13), did it not occur to you that the whole alleged attack looked a bit like the criminal equivalent of a press release, meant to send a message rather than accomplish anything? If you were beaten up, would you somehow remember to pick up your Subway purchase afterward? If you were subjected to a vicious, racist, homophobic, life-altering attack that included a hint of lynching, would you really leave the rope draped around your neck and calmly walk, not run, home? Would you then walk past the security desk at your apartment building without telling anyone what had happened? Would you wait 40 minutes before informing the police what had happened? Smollett said he kept the rope around his neck to preserve evidence for the police. Yet in the police report filed on the night in question, he was quoted as saying he was reluctant to make a police report at all. Why would he preserve evidence to bolster a report he didn’t intend to make? Why, as an outspoken gay black man with a long history of casting aspersions on Trump, would he not immediately file a police report about an incident that seemingly confirmed his worst fears? If you were beating up somebody who was on his phone, would you maybe take the phone away from him so as to eliminate the possibility of a witness overhearing what you were doing? Have you noticed that alleged Trump-related hate crimes seem to have a tendency to turn out to be fiction? Did you think it odd that Smollett refused to give police his phone? Did you think it odd that Smollett didn’t give police his phone records for two weeks, and when he did, they were heavily redacted, as though he might be hiding something? Chicago reporters on the case began relaying that their sources in the police department were skeptical about Smollett’s claims soon after the alleged assault. Did you not notice? Did you take away any lessons from Covington? If not, why?"

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate,” an e-mailed statement from public relations consultant Anne Kavanagh reads. “Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

The announcement comes a day after Smollett’s newly hired attorney, Todd S. Pugh, told the Chicago Sun-Times that the actor expected “to [be] back online tomorrow with the investigators.”

Pugh said on Sunday that a possible sit-down with investigators would depend on “scheduling availability.” Monday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the department will “look forward to continuing the dialogue with his attorneys and finding a mutually beneficial time for him and detectives to sort through new information from the investigation.”

The police department has said for weeks Smollett was the victim of a possible hate crime last month in Streeterville, but investigators may now be probing whether Smollett paid two brothers he knew from “Empire” to stage the attack, law enforcement sources told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Police have been trying to arrange a “follow-up interview” with Smollett, after questioning the brothers, who were taken into custody and questioned Wednesday at O’Hare Airport after they got off a return flight from Nigeria. Information from the interview “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Guglielmi said Monday.

The two brothers issued a statement to CBS2 Monday, saying: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Smollett has told police he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 when two men walked up to him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him in the face, poured a substance — possibly bleach — on him and put a “thin, light rope” around his neck. The incident has been investigated as a hate crime.

Smollett has publicly expressed outrage at speculation that he may have set up the attack, including a lengthy interview with Good Morning America host Robin Roberts during which he called out “haters” who doubted his account of what happened. Smollett has acknowledged that one of the two men interviewed by police had served as his physical trainer.

The actor said he was reluctant to call police immediately after the attack because of the attention it would receive. Smollett’s manager, who said he was on the phone with the actor at the time of the assault, called authorities 40 minutes later. Smollett has since been interviewed by police and turned over redacted records from his cellphone."

The trajectory of the investigation ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett's attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he said.

Smollett, who is Black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that,

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

An amazing new Nasa animation reveals a glimpse of what it would be like to dive into Jupiter's hellish North Pole.

The flyby gives viewers a close-up of the 'lava-like' cyclones that whip across the planet's polar regions, boasting wind speeds as high as 220 miles per hour (350 kph).

Each cyclone ranges from 2,500 to 2,900 miles (4,000 to 4,600km) in diameter.

Unveiled at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna, Austria, the 80-second flyby was put together using images taken by Nasa's Juno probe, which is currently orbiting Jupiter.

Cameras aboard the £0.8 billion ($1.1 billion) spacecraft captured the planet's stormy poles in infrared light, which is invisible to human eyes, as part of ongoing research into the mysteries of Jupiter's inner workings.

Recorded by the probe's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper, or JIRAM, the infrared images allowed Nasa researchers to peer at polar cloud formations 45 miles (72 km) below the planet's cloud tops.

'Before Juno, we could only guess what Jupiter's poles would look like,' Dr Alberto Adriani, a Juno team member at Rome's Institute for Space Astrophysics and Planetology, said.

'Now, with Juno flying over the poles at a close distance it permits the collection of infrared imagery on Jupiter's polar weather patterns and its massive cyclones in unprecedented spatial resolution.'

The images unveiled the shape and structure of the nine icy cyclones at Jupiter's North Pole.

Dark red clouds in the animation were measured at -188°C (181°F), while bright yellow clouds clocked in at -12°C (9°F), according to Nasa.

Juno captured the images during its during its fourth close flyby of the planet, which sits 600 million miles (970 million km) from Earth.

How NASA's Juno probe to Jupiter will reveal the secrets of the solar system's biggest planet The Juno probe reached Jupiter in 2016 after a five-year, 1.8 billion-mile journey from Earth The Juno probe reached Jupiter on July 4, 2016, after a five-year, 1.8 billion-mile (2.8bn km) journey from Earth. Following a successful braking manoeuvre, it entered into a long polar orbit flying to within 3,100 miles (5,000 km) of the planet's swirling cloud tops. The probe skimmed to within just 2,600 miles (4,200 km) of the planet's clouds once a fortnight - too close to provide global coverage in a single image. No previous spacecraft has orbited so close to Jupiter, although two others have been sent plunging to their destruction through its atmosphere. To complete its risky mission Juno survived a circuit-frying radiation storm generated by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. The maelstrom of high energy particles travelling at nearly the speed of light is the harshest radiation environment in the Solar System. To cope with the conditions, the spacecraft was protected with special radiation-hardened wiring and sensor shielding. Its all-important 'brain' - the spacecraft's flight computer - was housed in an armoured vault made of titanium and weighing almost 400 pounds (172kg). The craft is expected to study the composition of the planet's atmosphere until 2021. Advertisement

So far, Juno has mapped about a third of Jupiter, a planet that was shrouded in mystery before the spacecraft entered its orbit in 2016.

Having travelled some 122 million miles during 11 close passes, Juno will swoop in for its twelfth flyby on May 24.

Experts studying data gathered by the probe found patterned cyclones and jet streams that extend 1,800 miles (2,900 km) below cloud level on the gas giant.

At each of the planet's poles is a cyclone several thousand miles wide. The study found that these cyclones are surrounded by a polygonal arrangement of storms - eight in the north and five in the south.

The findings, which revealed in unprecedented detail the interior of the planet, could lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the dynamics at work inside the atmosphere of gas giants.

Four international teams of researchers, including experts from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, analysed high precision readings taken by the Juno probe.

Powerful winds were found to flow in opposite directions on the surface of Jupiter, reaching speeds of more than 100 metres per second (220 mph / 360 kmh).

Exactly how this leads to the alternating bright and dark bands of gas with their swirling storms that are visible from the surface is unclear, but Juno's observations have helped to shed light on this.

Raging storms on Jupiter have long captured the imagination of mankind and a study published in March revealed the depths to which these fiery events extend. This picture of Jupiter's south pole is a mosaic of images acquired by Nasa's Juno probe. It shows the heat coming out from the planet through the clouds. Thinner clouds are yellow and dark red are the thicker ones

The probe's readings seem to suggest, as some had suspected, that they have their origins deep within the huge planet.

A solid mass of hydrogen and helium gas rotating as a solid body deep within the planet causes variations in wind at the surface.

This alters the gravity of the planet and leads to an imbalance between the northern and southern hemispheres

If these findings can also be observed inside neighbouring Saturn, it would suggest that the mechanism behind them are widespread among this class of planet.

Four international teams of researchers, including experts from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, analysed readings taken by the probe. Bands of vast swirling cloud formations that speed over the gas giant planet's surface are clearly visible in this amazing image

Nasa's Cassini mission to Saturn, which ended in 2017, provided similar data set for Saturn's gravitational field that is now being analysed, says Professor Jonathan Fortney, from the department of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California.

'Given the inherent complexity of planets, comparative planetary science has become an essential framework through which to study these astrophysical objects,' he said in a comment piece for the journal Nature.

'Thankfully, Jupiter has a sibling, the gas-giant planet Saturn.

'If a consistent physical picture could be put together for the two gas giants of the solar system, it would go a long way towards solidifying our understanding of the internal dynamics of this class of astrophysical object.'

Researchers found that Jupiter's gravitational field, which is known to vary from pole to pole, is unbalanced between the north and south of the planet.

Powerful winds flow in opposite directions on the surface of Jupiter, reaching speeds of more than 100 metres per second (220 mph / 360 kmh). Juno took this image of colourful, turbulent clouds in Jupiter's northern hemisphere on December 16, 2017, from 8,292 miles (13,345 km) above the tops of Jupiter's clouds

This is unusual for a planet which rotates at relatively high speed.

Experts found that this imbalance is generated by differences in the speed of wind flows in the atmosphere.

These flows could only have an effect on Jupiter's gravity if they originated from deep within its interior and involved a large amount of matter.

Juno revealed that 'odd' gravity events, including turbulent jet streams, stretch down to layers found at roughly one-twentieth of the planet's radius.

Exactly how winds lead to the alternating bright and dark bands of gas with their swirling storms that are visible from the surface was unclear, but Juno's observations have helped to shed light on this. Juno captured this image on December 16, 2017

Pressures at these depths are around 10 million times that of the atmosphere at Earth's surface.

More 'even' gravity events occur below this depth. This deep interior is made up of a mixture of hydrogen and helium gas that rotates as a solid body.

This part of Jupiter's atmosphere is made up of around one per cent of the planet's total mass, researchers found.

On Earth, roughly one millionth of the planet's mass makes up the atmosphere.

Energy that's lost from this interior pushes currents upward, where they reach up to the surface. This creates the fluid-like movement observed in Jupiter's upper atmosphere.

The studies also revealed details of the internal structure of the layers of inner atmosphere which make up 96 per cent of the planet.

Working inward from the outer atmosphere, there is first a layer composed of 99 per cent hydrogen and helium, which contains traces of ammonia and methane.

Around 20 per cent of this layer, towards the centre of the planet, is made up of helium that has condensed into rains.

Juno's readings seem to suggest, as some had suspected, these bands of wind have their origins deep within the huge planet. Citizen scientist Kevin Gill processed this image using data from the probe's onboard camera

The deep interior contains a thick 'soup' of gases which contain heavy metals, experts say. It is still not clear whether Jupiter has a solid core at its very centre.

Visible and infrared observations made by Juno of Jupiter's polar regions also revealed that the cyclones known to exist at the planet's poles create persistent many-sided patterns.

These often striking features have been captured in stunning images transmitted back to Earth, revealing what look like the swirls found in oil paint.

At the north pole, eight cyclones swirl around a single central cyclone, whereas the south polar cyclone is circled by five such cyclones.

The origins of these cyclones and how they persist without merging remains unknown, however.

One of the most breathtaking photos of Jupiter shows a 'string of pearls' – a series of eight massive rotating storms on its surface.

The image, taken on 24 October, 2017, was snapped when Juno was 20,577 miles (33,115 kilometres) above the tops of the clouds of the planet.

It was processed and colour enhanced by citizen scientists Gerald Eichstadt and Sean Doran."

Nasa has released a dazzling 4K tour of the moon using data collected from its orbiting spacecraft.

The tour gives a stunning new perspective of the moon's desolate surface, moving between regular views and digitally enhanced footage.

It takes the view on a trip through the fascinating lunar features, such as the 2,500-km (1,600-mile)-wide South Pole-Aitken Basin and the famous landing site of the Apollo 17 mission.

Incredible footage gives a stunning new perspective of the desolate surface that man walked on for the first time on July 20th, 1969. One digitally enhanced image (pictured) shows the Orientale Basin, located on the western border of the far side of the moon, which resembles a target ring bulls-eye. The impact structure's outermost rim - the Cordillera Mountains - is 930 km (580 miles) in diameter

The video was created from nine years' worth of data harvested by the space agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).

The craft has studied the celestial body from a height of 31 miles (50 km) since June 2009, capturing it in never-seen-before detail.

The probe has revealed the moon to be a dynamic world. For instance, it recently found that asteroids and comets crashing into the moon create, on average, 180 new craters at least 33 feet (10 metres) in diameter every year.

The tour explores various key sites on the near and far side of the moon, including footage of the North and South Pole.

It shows the bright illuminations seen in 2017 images of the Shackleton crater located on the moon's South Pole.

It also shows the Tycho crater, located in the southern lunar highlands, and Aristarchus Plateau, currently a compelling target for future exploration.

The 4K lunar simulation, captured using images from Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, gives a glimpse of the moon's dramatic boulders and craters in amazing detail. Aristarchus Plateau (pictured) is currently a compelling target for future exploration

Pictured is Tycho crater, located in the southern lunar highlands. It is one of the youngest impact crators on the moon and formed just 108 million years ago. The Nasa film moves between regular videos of the moon to digitally enhanced footage showing its rugged surface and incredible geological features

The footage shows the bright illuminations seen in 2017 images of the Shackleton Crater located on the moon's South Pole. The Shackleton Crater could be turned into 'an oasis of warm sunlight surrounded by a desert of freezing cold darkness' according to the space agency

The South Pole-Aitken Basin on the lunar far side is one of the largest and oldest impact features in the solar system and easily seen in the elevation data. The low center is dark blue and purple. Mountains on its edge, remnants of outer rings, are red and yellow

Since the moon's spin axis is tilted less than 2 degrees relative to its orbital plane, the interiors of of the craters on the North Pole never receive any direct sunlight. These regions are perpetually dark and very cold - sometimes reaching temperatures as low as -248°C

The footage explores various key sites on the near and far side of the moon, including footage of the North and South Pole. It was here the craft first returned data that indicated ice may make up as much as 22 per cent of surface material (pictured in light blue). Nasa has previously said it wants to transform the lunar crater into a science laboratory for robots

One digitally enhanced image reveals the Orientale Basin, located on the western border of the far side of the moon, which resembles a target ring bulls-eye.

'As the visualisation moves around the near side, far side, north and south poles, we highlight interesting features, sites, and information gathered on the lunar terrain', a Nasa spokesperson said.

It is a unique view of an aurora over America.

NASA has released this stunning image, captured on April 21st, showing the aurora borealis over North America.

It shows the after effects of a major solar storm on April 19th, and was captured in infrared 'night vision'.

In the image, the satellite sensor detected the visible light emissions that occurred as energetic particles from Earth’s magnetosphere rained down into the oxygen and nitrogen gases of the upper atmosphere.

It was captured at 3:46 a.m. Eastern Time on April 21, 2018, using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi NPP satellite.

NASA says the nighttime image was made possible through VIIRS 'day-night band,' which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe signals such as airglow, auroras, wildfires, city lights, and reflected moonlight.

The image captured by NASA shows a huge chunk of North America

In the image, the sensor detected the visible light emissions that occurred as energetic particles from Earth's magnetosphere rained down into the oxygen and nitrogen gases of the upper atmosphere.

They were caused by an April 19 event when the Sun spewed a potent stream of particles and electromagnetic energy—a strong blast of solar wind—that arrived at Earth a few days later and stirred up our magnetic field.

The interaction between these solar emissions and our magnetic field causes the particles already trapped around the planet to be accelerated down toward the atmosphere.

The collisions make the auroral light.

It is the latest in a series of stunning NASA images of auroras from space.

Earlier this year an astronaut living on the International Space Station (ISS) posted a mesmerising image of auroras around Earth.

The beautiful image shows the eerie green hues of the aurora as the sun rises over the southern hemisphere of our planet.

After some minor photo-enhancement from the space agency, the image - which was initially posted on Instagram - was re-posted by NASA.

The incredible image shows the sunrise over the southern hemisphere of our planet dancing with the eerie green hues of the aurora. It was posted to the Instagram of astronaut Ricky Arnold and was captioned 'Sunrise crashes an aurora party over the southern hemisphere'

'Sunrise crashes an aurora party over the southern hemisphere,' American astronaut Ricky Arnold captioned his out-of-this-world snap.

Nasa liked the photo so much it made the space agency's image of the day last week.

The Northern and Southern Lights are natural light spectacles triggered in our atmosphere that are also known as the 'Auroras'.

There are two types of Aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means 'dawn of the north', and Aurora Australis, 'dawn of the south.'

The displays light up when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the Earth's atmosphere.

Auroras are regularly seen from the orbiting ISS.

This is not the first time an ISS astronaut has taken an image of the auroras.

Famed astronaut Scott Kelly took a picture showing the Earth enclosed in a red hue in 2015.

At 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, the astronauts of the satellite lab see extraordinary things on a daily basis.

Mr Arnold has also posted images of Namibia, Australia and San Francisco, as well as selfies taken in minimal gravity.

Scientists say a coffee-table sized slab of Martian rock dubbed ‘Old Soaker’ offers a unique glimpse into the red planet’s watery past.

And in some ways, it looks a lot like Earth.

It’s thought that Mars’ Gale Crater may have been filled with lakes roughly 3.5 billion years ago – and, last year, scientists revealed they’d discovered what could be cracks left behind by mud.

Now, further analysis of the observations from NASA’s Curiosity rover suggests the lines are, in fact, mudcracks, indicating that the once-wet region experienced dramatic changes over the course of its life.

It’s thought that Mars’ Gale Crater may have been filled with lakes roughly 3.5 billion years ago. Scientists now say a coffee-table sized slab of Martian rock dubbed ‘Old Soaker’ (pictured) offers a unique glimpse into the red planet’s watery past. In the study, the researchers studied polygon dessication features similar to those seen on Earth

These cracks, called dessication mudcracks, are created when wet sediment is exposed to air, the researchers explain.

As the cracks discovered in Gale Crater are situated near the center of where a lake bed once sat, the team says the water levels must have experienced dramatic fluctuations.

Over time, the water rose and fell, leaving its center exposed.

The team analyzed Old Soaker using several instruments, including Curiosity's Mastcam, Mars Hand Lens Imager, ChemCam Laser Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS), and Alpha-Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS).

‘We are now confident that these are mudcracks,’ explains lead author Nathaniel Stein, a geologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

‘The mudcracks show that the lakes in the Gale Crater had gone through the same types of cycles that we see on Earth.’

The analysis confirmed they were formed through exposure to air, as opposed to another mechanism.

According to Stein, ‘the mudcracks are exciting because they add context to our understanding of this ancient lacustrine system.’

‘We are capturing a moment in time,’ Stein says.

‘This research is just a chapter in a story that Curiosity has been building since the beginning of its mission.’"

But the latest real-world twist involving a member of its cast is the strangest — and saddest — yet.

On Jan. 29, Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon, the openly gay heir to the show’s hip-hop record label throne, was allegedly attacked in a baroque hate crime. He told police that his attackers immediately identified him as a gay actor from “Empire,” then proceeded to yell racial and homophobic slurs, shout “this is MAGA country,” pour an unknown chemical on him and place a noose around his neck. The story has since become even more complicated: The Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers, one of whom said that he played a small part on “Empire,” about their possible role in the attack. As of this writing, the department is seeking to interview Smollett again; he has hired a criminal defense attorney.

But even before these latest details emerged, when I first heard of the attack on Smollett, I had to pause. On “Empire,” Jamal Lyon came out as gay in front of his homophobic, abusive father; took a bullet for that same father and overcame an addiction to pain pills. Was I reading last week’s episode recap, or did this actually happen in my hometown of Chicago? Almost immediately, I had a terrible feeling that I was victim blaming, or worse, that I am so brainwashed that I no longer can hear cries of hurt and outrage from my own black community.

It was a horrifying feeling that I am still trying to work through almost three weeks later.





I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did. I know that there is a deep, dark racist history in Chicago and, if proved true, this would be just one more point on the list.

And yet I struggled with Smollett’s story.

I tried telling myself that it is possible that two assailants were walking around downtown Chicago at 2 a.m. in January in 10-degree weather, waiting for a black victim. In addition to that, they were stalking around with a bottle of bleach and a rope. And, ultimately, the prey they selected was an actor on a show that they must’ve been somewhat familiar with, because they were able to not only name the show but also know that he played a gay character. Never mind the fact that he was likely bundled up. Also, after he fought to get away, he left the rope around his neck until he got to the hospital.

Perhaps I don’t want to believe him because this is a stark and scary reminder of the poor condition of the country (and city) that I call home. Maybe this story makes the boogeyman in my nightmares all too real, too close and too calculating. Maybe it’s because while I consider myself an ally to the LGBTQ community, I still don’t understand and appreciate the daily harassment that they endure. Or maybe even though I am a black woman, I still don’t know what it’s like to be a black man in America.

Over the past few hours, there have been speculations that have confirmed my worst fears. Unnamed “police sources” have claimed that Smollett orchestrated the entire thing.

If Smollett’s story is found to be untrue, it will cause irreparable damage to the communities most affected. Smollett would be the first example skeptics cite when they say we should be dubious of victims who step forward to share their experiences of racist hate crimes or sexual violence. The incident would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists. It would be the very embodiment of “fake news.”

And that reason, more than any other, is why I need this story to be true, despite its ugliness and despite what it would say about the danger of the world I live in. The damage done would be too deep and long-lasting.

Jussie Smollett appears to have picked the wrong location for his ""hate crime"" to be caught on video, if we compare his Good Morning America interview to the latest reports about the two Nigerian men who say the actor-singer paid them to stage an assault.As of now, it looks as though police believe Empire star Smollett not only lied about a phony hate crime committed against him by supporters of President Trump, he also hoped to arrange for the hoax to be recorded by a surveillance camera.According to CBS Chicago , Smollett, who is black and gay, paid $3500 to two brothers (who are also black) to stage a racist and homophobic attack on him.If the reports are accurate, Smollett's planning was meticulous, including rehearsals and the purchase of the items used in the attack.Smollett claimed he was accosted by two men in downtown Chicago at about 1:30 a.m. on January 29. He told police his attackers recognized him, shouted racist and homophobic slurs, beat him up, poured bleach on him, wrapped a noose around his neck, and warned him that ""This is MAGA country!""- a reference to the president's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.Over the past 20 or so days, according to various media reports, the story has completely fallen apart.Police sources tell CBS Chicago that the rope wrapped around Smollett's neck was traced back to a purchase made by Smollett himself.What's more, a search of the brothers' apartment turned up bleach, a red hat, and a script from Smollett's TV show Empire. Apparently, one or both of the brothers worked on the show with Smollett.CBS Chicago adds, ""The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening.""The most important dot to connect to all of the above, though, comes from Smollett himself, who told Good Morning America (GMA) last week that he suspected a surveillance camera caught the whole incident.Speaking to GMA's Robin Roberts, Smollett said, ""And I looked up and I saw there was a camera directly on the light post that is in the intersection. So I'm like, 'there it is!'... And then the detective told me that the camera inside of the casing was facing north, so they didn't have it, and that was disappointing.""That detail appears to stick in his craw. Later in the interview, unprompted, he brings it up again: ""The camera facing north, how is that my issue?""And one can imagine, had there been surveillance footage of the attack, the investigation would have proceeded very, very differently.Once police had the footage, it would leak. Once cable and network news had the footage, it would loop endlessly. The fact that the two brothers are black wouldn't matter. CBS Chicago reports that a black face mask was found in their apartment. Smollett told police the attackers wore face masks. With those face masks, the organized left (the media, Democrats, celebrities) were allowed to assume his racist attackers were white.If local media reports prove true and Smollett did plan this, it's easy to see what he could have gained - had the altercation occurred in front of any of the other cameras he walked past that night.First off, he despises Trump and, it seems, Trump's supporters, and this was an easy way to smear both, especially in a world with a corrupt media that is always eager to spread any kind of fake news or hoax that makes Trump or his supporters look evil.Overall, it is just a fact that we now live in a media and entertainment culture where being a victim, most especially a black and gay victim of racist Trump supporters, assures you endless news cycles, worldwide fame, and unearned status as America's conscience. Smollett may have not only believed his hoax would sell millions of albums but make him a civil rights hero - the kind of victim-icon offered a prime speaking slot at the 2020 Democrat National Convention, a potent weapon relentlessly wielded by the media to pummel Trump and his supporters.Take a step back, though...Take a step back and look at the fire Smollett was allegedly willing to play with...Imagine what it would have done to this country and to the city of Chicago if the attack had been recorded, if an outlet like TMZ had leaked the video, and if the wildly irresponsible race baiters at CNN had broadcast that video over and over and over again - an endless loop of two men assaulting a gay, black man; pouring bleaching on him and tying a noose around his neck.It would have been just like that other media hoax - ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" - and we all know what that led to: the destruction of a predominantly black neighborhood in the ensuing riots.The American media are garbage.Thank heaven the Chicago police are not."

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” reps for the actor said this Presidents Day morning. “Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate,” they added in what has become an increasing game of defense for the actor who plays the gay Jamal Lyon on the Fox drama.

The widely condemned attack on Smollett in the early hours of January 29 was previously described as a racist and homophobic barrage that left the actor beaten, drenched in bleach and with a rope slung around his neck.

“Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf,” Smollett’s PR team declared in very PR language with a pass to attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, who said in recent days that the actor will “continue to cooperate” with the investigation. “We have no further comment today.”

After an outpouring of support for Smollett in the hours and days following the attack, the probe and public perception has shifted dramatically in the last few days.

While the Empire star is still not officially considered a formal suspect by the CPD and talk of him self staging the assault remain officially unconfirmed, the cops are eager, to put it mildly, to learn more from him about his relationship with Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo.

The brothers were previously described by Chicago police as “potential suspects” in the attack and arrested last week. Identified as the individuals in the photos of “persons of interest” in the Smollett case, the two were held without charge for 48 hours and then let go on the night of February 15.

The Osundario siblings – both former Empire extras and at least one a former personal trainer for Smollett – are now “fully” cooperating with authorities on the probe into the attack of almost three weeks ago.

Smollett’s defense lawyers put out a seething statement on February 16 that the actor “has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.” They added bluntly, “nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Yet, a law enforcement source told Deadline on February 17 that they have a “sense of frustration” over the lack of formal response for a further sit-down to go over new evidence that has come to light on the matter.

A sense of frustration that is growing."

It was Jan. 29th, just a few days before he would officially announce that he was running for president.

Fast forward to almost three weeks later, with reports coming out about how Smollett may have staged the attack to keep his “Empire” job. The case may even go to a grand jury as soon as this week.

Booker, doing campaign stops in New Hampshire on Sunday, sang the “let’s wait and see” tune:

Sen. Cory Booker, who called the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett a “modern-day lynching” after the actor reported it, is withholding judgment on reports alleging Smollett is under investigation for possible involvement in his own assault. Booker told reporters after meeting with hundreds of voters in Rochester, New Hampshire, that he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.” The Democratic presidential candidate turned his focus back to combating hate crimes broadly. Booker called for a unified pushback against “attacks on people because they’re different.”

Watch Booker’s pivot on the Smollett case play out in the video below:

Booker’s sudden decision to wait for the facts instead of rushing to judgment like he did when the Smollett story first broke is an interesting one. Especially when you compare how he treated then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh at his Supreme Court confirmation hearings to how he responded to the sexual assault allegations against Va. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D).

It appears the New Jersey Senator has one set of standards on issues that stand to benefit him politically, and another set of “standards” when they don’t.

Quelle surprise.

Within hours of the PM’s announcement, membership of the party surged by thousands. Leader Tim Farron declared that the poll was a chance for voters to avert a ‘disastrous’ Brexit.

He hailed it as a ‘chance to change the direction of the country’ and vowed to campaign to keep Britain in the single market.

Polls show that Theresa May is set to return after June's election with a majority of more than 100. But the Conservatives are vulnerable to the Lib Dems in several areas of the country

The unashamedly pro-European party hopes to walk back into some of the 49 seats it lost to both Labour and the Tories in the bloodbath of 2015.

However, Lib Dem sources refused to say definitively how many seats they hoped to win.

Nick Clegg, who resigned as leader after the humiliating defeat, will stand again to defend his seat in Sheffield Hallam, insiders said.

Some 50 per cent of those Lib Dems who stood in 2015 and lost have been re-selected to stand again. Sir Vince, 73, will make a political comeback after he lost his seat in Twickenham as the Tories swept to victory.

The former Business Secretary, who held the seat from 1997 to 2015, will stand against Tory MP Tania Mathias.

Sir Simon, who was an MP from 1983 to 2015, will stand in his former constituency of Bermondsey and Old Southwark.

The former deputy leader will challenge Labour MP Neil Coyle in the south-east London seat. Sir Simon, 65, said the Liberal Democrats had ‘as good a chance of winning again as we ever had’.

He claimed that Labour MPs are focused on ‘fighting internal battles’ within their party. Former Energy Secretary Sir Ed, 51, hopes to reclaim his former seat in Kingston and Surbiton from Conservative James Berry.

Sir Vince Cable lost his seat, which had been considered safe, to Tory candidate Tania Mathias in 2015 general election, losing his place in the cabinet in the process

Sir Ed Davey (left) and Sir Simon Hughes (right) also lost their seats in 2015 when the party was reduced to just eight MPs

Mr Farron said: ‘Bring this election on. The fightback starts here. This election is your chance to change the direction of our country.’ Striking an optimistic tone, he insisted that only his party could prevent a Tory majority.

Mr Farron said: ‘Labour won’t win any seats off the Conservatives. The SNP could only possibly win one seat off the Conservatives.

‘But there are dozens of Conservative seats where the Lib Dems are the challengers.’

Mr Farron told voters: ‘If you want to avoid a disastrous hard Brexit. If you want to keep Britain in the single market.

‘If you want a Britain that is open, tolerant and united, this is your chance.’

Party sources said: ‘We are pretty confident, we expect to do quite well.’ But the appeal of the Lib Dems in former strongholds like Cornwall, Devon and Somerset which came out in favour of leaving the EU may be a struggle.

Within hours of the yesterday’s announcement, membership of the party surged by thousands. Leader Tim Farron (pictured) declared that the poll was a chance for voters to avert a ‘disastrous’ Brexit

Those thousands of voters who backed Brexit may prove unlikely to support Mr Farron’s pro- Brussels message.

With polls putting the Lib Dems on only 10 per cent, any chance of returning to the parliamentary force they were in 2005 and 2010 seems unlikely.

But the party has always concentrated more on local campaigning in winnable seats than the national polls.

The 2015 backlash after five years in coalition with the Tories saw them lose ground to their former partners in south-west England and the London suburbs.

They will be hopeful that Sarah Olney’s success in the Richmond Park by-election last year is a sign the party is bouncing back in south-west London. Her victory took the party up to nine MPs.

Mr Farron indicated that the Lib Dem ambition was to prevent the Tories from having an outright majority, giving his party leverage over the terms of Brexit.

A surge in membership yesterday – gaining 2,500 new members within hours – meant the party has doubled in size since May 2015."

A spokesperson for the Chicago police said on Sunday they wanted to do a follow-up interview with the actor after claims were made by the brothers that they were paid £2,714 to stage a ‘racist’ street attack and put a noose around Smollett's neck.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett details his alleged attack by two men who he says put a 'rope around my neck' in TV interview

The actor, 36, was even said to have paid for the rope that was used in the alleged assault – with police sources claiming it was rehearsed days before, according to CBS.

Brothers Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, who worked as extras on Empire, are understood to have told detectives that Smollett orchestrated the attack.

The brothers have now been released without charge.

A spokesperson for Smollett's lawyers said: ""There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today.

“Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

Smollett has hit back at the hoax claims, saying he feels “angered and devastated”.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” a statement from his lawyers read.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

'I AM NOT LYING'

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, pointed out that one of the brothers was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in Ravenswood, at Smollett’s request, according to CBS.

EMPIRE STAR 'PAID FOR ROPE FOR NOOSE'

It has been claimed that the Empire actor paid for the rope.

The brothers, who were questioned by police this week before being released, were paid £2,714 ($3,500) before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return.

They left for Nigeria later in the day on January 29, hours after the attack.

Documents reportedly prove that one of the Osundairo brothers bought the rope which was found around Smollett’s neck in Chicago.

The brothers were arrested on Wednesday but were released on Friday without charge after police said new evidence emerged during their interrogations.

Police are now “eager to speak to Jussie Smollett” in light of the new information that was uncovered, according to ABC News.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

'RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC ATTACK'

""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Jussie, 36, who is black and gay and who plays gay character Jamal Lyon in Empire, claimed he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

He told how he was punched and kicked by masked attackers shouting ""This is MAGA country"" (Make America Great Again) in the early hours of January 29.

The actor said he was battered, doused in acid and had a noose put around his neck by the men, who also called him a “f***ot”.

He previously denied claims that he faked the Chicago attack because he was being written out of Empire.

Cops initially said the Osundairo brothers were persons of interest after they were recognised from CCTV footage in the area where Smollett said two men jumped him at 2am.

After the Nigerian brothers were arrested, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News they were not involved in the attack.

In the wake of the assault, Jussie has hit back at claims that the attack was faked.

SMOLLETT DENIES FAKING ATTACK

Speaking out about the hoax claims, Jussie said: ""I'm p***ed off. It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks.""

Holding back tears, he said:""Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It's the truth.

""Then it became a thing of, like, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth. You don't even want to see the truth.""

The performer went back to work two weeks ago for the first time since two masked men attacked him and put a rope around his neck in Chicago, USA, in January.

The Chicago Sun Times reported that he told the crowd at the Troubador in West Hollywood: ""The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK.""

""I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.""

However, his phone records were rejected by police for being heavily redacted’ in the investigation into his brutal racist attack.

TMZ reported that the PDF file the 35-year-old star submitted could have been ""manipulated"" - claiming that numbers may have been added or deleted - although police told the publication that there is no evidence that the file had been altered.

Police began asking for more information about Smollett after arresting two brothers who were believed to be two men caught by a surveillance camera in the neighborhood where the alleged attack took place. Both men were released on Friday without being charged, with police citing “new evidence.”

Both men are said to be cooperating with police as the investigation moves forward. Police said they seized several items from a raid of the men’s home, including a black facemask hat, an Empire script, a phone, receipts, a red hat, and bleach.

Smollett, who plays Jamal on the Fox TV drama Empire, told police that he was attacked in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 after leaving a Subway restaurant. He claimed two men approached him, yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him.

They then allegedly beat Smollett, put a rope around his neck, and poured an unknown chemical substance believed to be bleach on him.

Smollett’s manager Brandon Moore, who claimed to be on the phone with Smollett at the time of the attack, later told police that he heard the attackers calling Smollett “Empire faggot [racial expletive]” and shouting “This is MAGA country!”

But details of Smollett’s account of the event also raised a number of red flags, including the fact that his cell phone was not stolen, he still had the sandwich he had purchased after the attack, and the linking of the racist, homophobic attack with President Trump, of whom Smollett has been critical.

Some outlets, particularly conservative and right-wing websites, began to speculate that Smollett had fabricated the story, especially after he refused to turn over his complete phone records, only offering police a redacted version.

Since then, sources close to the investigation have alleged that Smollett paid the two men $3,500 to stage the attack, reports Chicago’s CBS 2 News. The brothers reportedly told investigators that Smollett directed them to buy the rope used in the incident, and that they had rehearsed their plan just days before the incident.

According to CNN, two Chicago Police sources said that they believe Smollett paid the men to attack him, and that records show the brothers bought the rope at a Chicago hardware store.

On Sunday, police released a statement saying they “are not in a position to confirm, deny, or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

“There are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,” Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote in a tweet responding to those allegations.

Smollett’s attorneys issued a statement saying their client is angry about the accusations being made against him. They also said they would continue cooperating with the police, but only through official channels, and will not respond to allegations from unnamed or anonymous sources.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victory Henderson said. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the lawyers added. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”"

It has all but been destroyed, this tale of MAGA-hat wearing oppressors who lynched singer-actor Jussie Smollett in the dead of a sub-freezing night. But now, new revelations on the case have come out that may show not only how fabricated the entire episode was, but that Smollett could possibly be a venal individual willing to have others punished over his fabrication.

TMZ reports some of the new findings. (And yes, there is a hesitation, as this is the same outlet that provoked some of the initial misreporting.) The outlet reports that police contacts informed it that the two Nigerian brothers hired by Smollett are being kept at a secure location, to ensure they have no contact with the “Empire” actor. What the police found while raiding their home is the revealing aspect.

In searching their residence, the police, according to TMZ, found magazines that had pages missing. They are trying to determine if these pages would coincide with the threatening letter that Smollett reported having received just over a week prior to his “attack” story. If this detail is attributed, it shows just how deep of a cover Smollett intended for his hoax. But there is an even more evil detail emerging.

TMZ reports its law enforcement sources stated when the police took the brothers into custody they reached Smollett to inform him that they had 2 suspects. Smollett was asked if he would be willing to sign complaints against the two individuals, and he answered that he was willing to do so. However, once he learned that the two in custody were the Nigerian brothers he has been connected with, he recanted his willingness.

If this proves accurate, this would seem to indicate that Smollett was more than willing to have two individuals brought up on charges for a crime that he had entirely staged. While he was of the belief that police had detained two individuals he was willing to go forward with charges, but once he realized they detained his accomplices — that is, the actual perpetrators of his hoax — he became unwilling to cooperate.

If these details become confirmed then the entire interpretation of this bizarre episode will be shifted. There have been indications in the press and broader media that some forgiveness for the actor would play out. Should it become settled that he was willing to go forward with a pair of individuals being charged with a crime for his contrived story, then all manner of sympathy for the performer needs to dissipate."

We’ve seen it among unhinged journalists, virtue-signaling celebrities, and Democratic politicians. We’ve seen it manifest in the ugliest form of hatred – the common hate-hoax – and it’s doing more to divide America than the source of the perpetrators’ anger.

They hate President Trump. They hate the people who got him elected. The hate the idea of making America great again because as much of the MAGA agenda comes to pass, they’re learning they’ve been wrong the whole time. I know first hand. I’ve been proven wrong myself.

No, I’m not a hate-hoaxer, but I’ve been against the President to varying degrees for over three years now. Before he officially won the GOP nomination in 2016, I opposed him because I felt he would do too much damage while delivering only a moderate amount of good policies. He wasn’t as bad as John Kasich or Jeb Bush, but we had Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul as better candidates. Nevertheless, he won the nomination, prompting me to spend the final leg of the 2016 election without a horse in the race. I didn’t like the idea of Trump being President, but under no circumstances did I want Hillary Clinton to be President, either.

100% crowdfunded news. Please help.

After he won, I became a cautious but hopeful watcher. While we worked on alternatives to bring limited-government federalism to the forefront of local, state, and national politics, I took a case-by-case stance on the President himself. When he did well, I praised him. When he did poorly, I criticized him. This stance has remained until this day, though there have been times when I was more supportive or more critical, depending on the policy discussion of the day. Tax and bureaucratic cuts – good. Tariffs and bump stock bans – bad. The recent cave on the border omnibus – very bad. Most foreign policy moves (leaving Iran deal, leaving Paris accords, moving embassy to Jerusalem) – very good.

Unfortunately, it seems many on the left have been unwilling to recognize even the remotest possibility anything the President is doing is good. What’s worse is that some have been so aggressive in their desire to prove their point that they’ve pretended to be victims for the sake of getting their “victims’ perks” of love and affection from their peers while painting anyone wearing a MAGA hat as bigoted and hateful.

Thus, the anti-MAGA hate hoax was born and it’s been so prominent over the last two-and-a-half years, one must wonder how mainstream media and Democrats became so gullible that they fall for it every single time.

Andy Ngo at Quillette put together a comprehensive list of hate hoaxes that leftists have perpetrated to paint the President and his supporters as racists. It’s absolutely stunning when you see the magnitude of the hatred – THEIR hatred – that makes them willing to tell bald-faced lies just to prove the movement they oppose is as bad as they think it is.

I’ve had ideological disagreements with nearly every presidential candidate (let alone every President) since I became an adult. There’s nothing wrong with disagreement as long as one is willing to not be blinded in one direction or the other. There are plenty who blindly follow President Trump to approximately the same degree that supporters blindly followed President Obama. The herd mentality seems to have become the way of the political world in America for our last two presidents. But that blind devotion is simply an annoyance. The blind hatred that drives people to commit these hoaxes is far more dangerous.

It’s likely when the details are fully revealed regarding Jussie Smollett’s hate-hoax, it was driven more by a narcissistic desire to advance his career rather than pure hatred for the MAGA crowd or the President, but obviously the latter hatred played a role in his decision-making process. This type of action is never acceptable. We have enough outrage in America. There’s no need to manufacture even more for false reasons.

It’s time for the unhinged left to stop assuming every MAGA supporter is racist and start asking how the actions of those on their side of the political aisle drove massive amounts of people to support President Trump. Perhaps then, they’ll realize the hatred is coming mostly from them.

There are now reports that Smollett may have taken part in an alleged hate crime hoax to both make supporters of President Donald Trump look bad and give his career a boost.

When the news first broke of the possible attack on Smollett, leftist politicians took almost no time to tweet their outrage at the supposed “hate crime,” which consisted of an alleged “racist” and “homophobic” attack against Smollett.

With the release of the latest information indicating that Smollett’s story might not pan out, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) actually deleted her tweet after CNN published an article over the weekend that said that “two law enforcement sources” told them that “Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollet paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month.”

Here’s Pelosi’s now-deleted tweet:

Pelosi wasn’t the only politician who tweeted outrage and support for Smollett, she was just the only one who deleted her original statement.

Here are some of the other politicians who wasted no time in coming to the defense of Smollett:

Despite the new information coming in, Booker, Harris, Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders, and Waters have kept their original tweets in support of Smollett up on the social media platform.

Should the alleged attack on Smollett indeed be classified as a hoax, this would continue a disturbing trend by the media of pushing a story with a false narrative."

GMA’s spin comes as multiple high-profile media personalities, including CNN’s Brian Stelter, are attempting to defend the media’s handling of the case.

After refusing to qualify the January 29 “hate crime” attack against Smollett as “alleged” last week, Roberts was finally willing to apply the journalistically responsible descriptor Monday morning after “a new twist” in the case, as she put it euphemistically.

“A new twist in the Jussie Smollett case,” Roberts said Monday, MRC reports. “The actor firing back this morning as the story of his alleged attack faces questions.” Roberts then revealed the bombshell that dropped Saturday from multiple oultets, including CBS News: “Police in Chicago say they’re working to corroborate allegations that Smollett paid two men to stage the assault,” said the anchor.

“When I sat down with Jussie, it was Tuesday night in Chicago,” she explained, her tone a bit defensive (video below). “At the time to give his first account, publicly give his first account, of what he said happened. And we have to remember, at that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent. It was credible. And that he was being cooperative. Now this was all before the interview aired on Thursday and then we found out about the brothers.”

She went on to acknowledge that sometimes police say one thing publicly and another behind the scenes.

In her interview and follow-up reporting last week, Roberts repeatedly refused to qualify his claims, as MRC pointed out last week: “If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal?” she asked him. “It’s been two weeks since that night left actor Jussie Smollett bruised but not broken,” she said, again failing to qualify the language. “That’s the first time he’s given a detailed account, an account that Chicago police have saids that been consistent,” she stressed after her interview. “He hasn’t changed his story and they also said it’s credible. The police have said that and also that he’s been very cooperative.”

As MRC points out, her fellow media personalities were ready to come to her defense Monday, ABC legal analyst Dan Abrams praising her for her what he portrayed as a fair and balanced interview. “[E]ven in the interview you did, you were talking about the skeptics. You were talking about the people who questioned his account,” he said, failing to note the dismissive attitude about those “skeptics” promoted by the network and other mainstream outlets. “So, it’s not new this idea that there are questions about what happened. What’s new is that the police now seem to be making it clear that they believe the brothers and have, at the very least, serious questions about Jussie.”

The panel went on to discuss the potential negative impact on real victims of hate crimes if this whole thing turns out to be a hoax, but notably failed to mention the smear of Trump supporters involved in the initial narrative promoted largely unquestioningly by the media.

Another Smollett coverage damage control effort by a big name media personality has been pointed out by Grabien Media Editor Tom Elliott and Mediate writer Julia Rosas (h/t Twitchy): While CNN’s Brian Stelter has admitted that “perhaps the questioning was not tough enough on Good Morning America,” he insists that this is ultimately not about the media.

“Perhaps the questioning was not tough enough on Good Morning America, but ultimately this is not about the media or politicians or activists, or any of the other people that might have been fooled,” Stelter said after the bombshell reports on the “new twist” in the case Saturday. “It’s about Jussie.”

“There was a rush to judgment, I think it was mostly in the celebrity press and among activists and among Twitter people,” Stelter asserted. “I think it was a really careful reporting by news organizations. But it all gets lumped in together at the end of the day.”

Smollett plays a

gay character of ""Jamal"" on the Fox TV drama series.

News of the

reported assault went viral and was met with mixed reactions online, with many suggesting the

incident

was a hoax.

Smollett Lawyers on February 17, denied he had any role in the assault.

He confirmed that the assault was carried out by two white men.

Their statement came after sources told US media that police believed he may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack on January 29.

The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo worked as extras on Empire, a drama about a hip-hop mogul and his family.

Police have only said the ""trajectory of the investigation"" has shifted.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview,""

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

Empire is a story unlike any other.

For one, it is an all-black A-list cast, which is uncommon in the industry for a ‘black show’ to have a prime time slot with an overwhelming number of viewers.

Because of the increasing number of viewers every week, Empire was renewed for a second season just 10 days after the original premiere.

The power of the show is definitely in the scripting, which is carefully and systematically told. The show is an insight into how the real world of the music industry operates."

In a statement released on Monday morning, his PR rep, Anne Kavanagh said, ""There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett's attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.""

As The Blast previously reported, Chicago police would not comment on whether Smollett was being classified as a victim or a suspect at this point in the investigation, saying, ""We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with the Empire cast member before we can answer this question.""

Officials have reached out to Smollett's attorney and requested additional time to interview him, and it's now apparent they want to use the information provided from the Nigerian brothers.

Ola and Abel Usondairos reportedly told police Smollett paid them to participate in a staged attack, and even instructed them to buy the rope that was tied around his neck.

The brothers, who took off to Nigeria the day after the attack and were arrested when they came home, have been released with no charges and are cooperating with police.

Smollett's attorney released a scathing statement over the weekend, claiming the star is devastated over the reports, and that he has ""been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.""

As we reported, days after the attack, Smollett played to a sold-out crowd at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, and fought back tears while telling the audience, ""I couldn’t let those motherf**kers win.""

After more evidence appears to suggest Smollett orchestrated his own attack, stars and politicians have started to publicly change their tune and erase tracks of support."

Booker, who is running for president, was one of several Democrats to weigh in on initial reports of the attack.

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.

The senator tweeted that it was ""an attempted modern-day lynching"" and connected it to the need to pass legislation designating lynching as a federal hate crime.

Critics from the right have also had plenty to say.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" last week, Smollett said one of his attacker's said ""'This MAGA country n****r' and he punched me in the face so I punched his a** back.""

There had also been initial inaccurate news reports that the attackers wore Make America Great (MAGA) hats, something Smollett denied during his ""GMA"" interview.

""I never said that,"" he said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.""

Donald Trump Jr. tweeted about the latest developments in the Smollett case on Monday.

Police initially probed the attack as a possible hate crime, but the case apparently took a U-turn after the suspects were arrested and interrogated.

The Jussie Smollett assault investigation has ushered in a whole new perspective after reports surfaced that the ""Empire"" actor could be familiar with the alleged perpetrators and could have orchestrated the attack.

Smolett was allegedly beaten by two assailants late last month in a suspected racist and homophobic attack in Chicago.

However, on Wednesday CNN cited police sources familiar with the investigation as saying that Chicago police believe Smollett paid the two men to stage the assault.

MORE: ""This is America""? Race, Music and Politics Collide

The suspects, who are brothers, were arrested and questioned by Chicago police last Wednesday. They were released without being charged on Friday as officials cited the discovery of ""new evidence"" and ""additional investigative work to complete"".

Smollett's attorneys said in a statement to CNN that Smollett denied the allegations as outright lies and was devastated by the report.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement reads.

""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

According to the statement, Smollett's attorneys have refused to respond to CNN's sources and pledged to continue cooperating with authorities.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, plays gay character Jamal Lyon on Fox's ""Empire"". He was hospitalised on 29 January after what was first investigated as a hate crime. He told reporters he was attacked by two masked perpetrators who yelled, ""Aren't you that f****t 'Empire' n*****?"" before attacking him, placing a rope around his neck and thrown a chemical — supposedly a bleach — on him.

They also allegedly yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" before walking away from the scene.

Smollett blamed the purported assault on anti-Black sentiment. ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" Smollett said. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now."""

It’s me again, one of the few people in 2019 America who doesn’t hate Donald Trump so much that I can’t think straight, nor love Donald Trump so much that I can’t think straight. It can get a bit cold and lonely out here in the wilderness, far from the firelight and community spirit of both the #NeverTrump and #AlwaysTrump camps. Things can get confusing, without the comfort of seeing reality through the filters of “Will this hurt him?” or “Will this help him?” Trying to look at things as they are, rather than how I’d prefer them to be, is tiring. I envy you folks who already know everything. I’m sorry you hate my guts, but I can live with it if the only alternative is to stop thinking for myself. I’ll continue to view current events as they are, regardless of how they affect people I do or don’t like.

Take the Jussie Smollett story, for example. Three weeks ago, I’d never heard of him. Now everybody has heard of him. Why? Because he claimed he was beaten up by racist, homophobic Trump supporters. If you’re #NeverTrump, that’s all you needed to hear. The mere accusation was sufficient. It was too good to check. You didn’t need any evidence, and the outlandish, counterintuitive details of Smollett’s story didn’t phase you. If you’re #AlwaysTrump, you assumed he was lying and you resented being blamed for something you didn’t do. As it turns out, the #AlwaysTrump folks were right. They were vindicated.

For what it’s worth, I was skeptical about Smollett’s story from the start. It just didn’t add up:

It confirmed my biases, but that alone isn’t proof of anything. And here’s a recap of my subsequent conversations with credulous libs who were certain it happened just as Smollett said it did:

this jussie smollett thing is weird, his story doesn’t make sense

OH IT DOESN’T MAKE SENSE THAT A GAY BLACK MAN MIGHT GET ATTACKED

i’m not saying it never happens, but

BUT WHAT, YOU THINK HE’S LYING

yeah, i guess so, it’s ridiculous

I hope you’ll humor me as I luxuriate in the feeling of being right about something. It’s increasingly rare and I reserve the right to enjoy it.

Of course, because Smollett claimed his attackers were Trump supporters, all the people who don’t want Trump to be president had to weigh in. That included most of the current Democratic Party candidates for president. Here’s one:

Translation: “The initial story confirmed my biases and gave me a political weapon to wield against my opponent, so I swung away without worrying about whether it was true. This new information threatens to prove me very, very wrong, so now I’m stalling for time until I can come up with some really good bull$#!+.”

It’s the same thing that happened with Nathan Phillips vs. MAGA Hat Kid, which was one month ago today. In the space of four short weeks, most of the current Dem contenders have loudly and proudly fallen for two huge hoaxes intended to demonize Trump supporters. They assumed the worst about their opponents, they were wrong, and they have not apologized. Somebody might ask them why they keep doing that, if we had a press that was interested in the truth.

We don’t.

Caleb Howe at Mediaite has collected a whole lot of snap judgments on Jussie Smollett’s wild, implausible story, from people who call themselves journalists. They spread fake news, and now they’re making a bunch of excuses for spreading fake news. Then they wonder why people don’t trust them.

The only alternative would be to admit they believed a ridiculous story because they wanted to believe it, and to apologize to the people they smeared by associating them with a hate crime that never actually happened.

How likely is that?"

5 Takeaways From the Jussie Smollett Hoax.

Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 2

(ThyBlackMan.com) I don’t watch the show “Empire,” so I’d never heard of Jussie Smollett before the story broke that he was physically assaulted in an apparent racist, homophobic attack. I suspect most Americans, like myself, thought his story was fishy from the very beginning. Nonetheless, as Americans tend to do, we gave him the benefit of the doubt until more details emerged.

His story seemed so unrealistic and convenient I assumed it would be a day or two before it all blew up in his face. It simply never added up. Trust me, I’ve been a thug (before Christ) and I’ve been the victim of a violent crime, if criminals had the time to tie a noose around your neck and shout “this is MAGA country” in your face, you’d remember some specific details about their features, clothing, smells, etc.

Stop and think about it. What black man in Chicago, one of the most liberal cities in all of America, is attacked in the middle of the night because he’s black or gay? It would be different if Smollett were robbed for money or gangsters mistook him for someone else. That wasn’t the case. Additionally, on the night of the attack, temperatures were well below freezing. Wouldn’t Smollett have been bundled up? I wouldn’t recognize the guy on the red carpet, let alone during an arctic blizzard! How is an attacker going to recognize and target him specifically because of his skin color and lifestyle?!

Democrats like Jussie Smollett shouldn’t be able to get away with fabricating stories created to divide Americans and simply walk away with a slap on the wrist. However, since this story no longer serves its intended to purpose to destroy Trump, I suspect his left-wing media allies will sweep it under the rug as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, here are some useful takeaways from the Jussie Smollett hoax:

1) Political correctness forbade us from calling BS: Face it, although most of us instinctively knew the story was a hoax from the onset, for fear of being labeled racists or homophobes by strangers, we decided to sit back and trust the cops and the media while hoping for the best. The left has us where they want us. Not only have we succumb to self-censorship, but the real bullies portray us as the bullies.

2) The media wanted this story to be true: The mainstream media (MSM) has such disdain for President Trump and his supporters that they were willing to believe Jussie Smollett’s lie before the investigation even began. The truth is the MSM is still mad at themselves. Why? The combination of Donald Trump’s huge personality and their overwhelming coverage of him during the GOP primary helped him secure the presidential nomination for the GOP. They wanted to run against him because they believed Hillary Clinton would easily defeat him in the general election. She didn’t. They want revenge.

3) Democrats wanted this story to be true: No victims, no votes! When you stop to think about it, it seems like Democrats don’t want racism to end. Their party would be useless if it did. Without victims they won’t get votes. If all Americans were financially independent and content with their lives, there’d be no need for the Democratic Party as it exists today. The Left constantly stokes fear and anger into the hearts and minds of their voters in hopes that more Americans will depend on them for protection from evil conservatives, and for purpose in life. Democrats choose to believe that white Christian, conservative men are all racists and homophobes. Not because they necessarily believe it, but void of real solutions to the nation’s problems, they need a bogeyman to secure their power.

4) Jussie Smollett isn’t a good guy: I think “hate crime” legislation is stupid. If you’re going to charge a person for a crime, charge them for the actual crime they’ve committed. It’s a safe bet that most violent criminals have malice in their heart. Tacking on additional time to their sentences based on feelings isn’t justice; it’s juvenile. However, if anyone should be charged with a hate crime it should be Smollett! This guy could’ve started race riots! Imagine if black Democrats had begun physically assaulting Trump supporters because they believed Smollett’s story. The fact that this didn’t happen is indicative of how skeptical the black community was about the allegations. Smollett hates Donald Trump so much, that he either didn’t care or think of the havoc this lie could’ve wreaked across America. Sick!

5) America isn’t the place Democrats say it is: What does it say about America when a gay, rich, black man pretends to be the victim of a racist, homophobic crime? It tells us that such crimes are rare. It also tells us that most Americans are too consumed with their own lives to care about Smollett’s race and sexual preference. Americans, in general appreciate diversity. It’s democrats that are intolerant.

Liberals who live in the social-justice bubbles of Chicago, Los Angeles and New York don’t have a clue of what people are like outside of their insulated enclaves. Nor do they care to know. Democrats project their feelings onto conservatives. Jussie Smollett is indicative of what the left has become; dangerous, irrational, hateful, judgmental, close-minded, self-absorbed and phony.

The Blast reports that the FBI is investigating who sent the letter, regardless of whether or not the threat was legitimate or part of an orchestrated scheme involving Smollett. Sources told the news outlet that the possible charge would be ""mailing threatening communications.""

According to the news outlet, the charge states that ""whoever knowingly so deposits or causes to be delivered...any communication...addressed to any other person and containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of the addressee or of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.""

Ultimately, whoever sent the letter could be fined and sentenced to five years in prison, if prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Days before the alleged attack, a letter containing white powder — which later was determined to be aspirin — was sent to the set of Empire. Smollett described the letter in an interview last week with Good Morning America, saying, ""It had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing toward it with the words that says Smollett Jussie, you will die.""

As previously reported, police are reportedly interested in interviewing Smollett again after the scope of the case ""shifted"" following the arrest and release of two men suspected of the alleged attack against Smollett.

Smollett's spokeswoman, Pamela Sharp, told local Chicago news outlets Sunday there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanaugh, could not confirm if Smollett agreed to another interview.

Police confirmed ""developments"" in the investigation, although did not confirm reports that Smollett was suspected of orchestrating the highly-publicized attack.

""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote on Twitter Sunday.

Smollett, 36, claimed he was attacked by two men on Jan. 29 outside his Chicago apartment building, saying that the men yelled racial and homophobic slurs, dumped an unknown chemical on him and put a rope around his neck.

Friday, brothers Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo were arrested and released hours later without being charged after police named them as persons of interest. Guglielmi said they were released after they provided ""new evidence.""

Law enforcement sources told local news outlets the brothers told detectives that Smollett paid them to take part in the alleged attack and bought the rope found around the actor's neck. They reportedly said they were paid $3,500 before they left for Nigeria on the day of the attack and were promised $500 once they returned to Chicago. They also reportedly said they rehearsed the attack ""days"" before it happened.

Smollett continues to maintain that he is a victim in the attack. In a statement from his lawyers, he insisted that he did not play a ""role in his own attack.""

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement from Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

They said Smollett will continue to cooperate with police, adding, ""At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels."""

Jussie Smollett’s lawyers have denied that he had any role to play in his own racist and homophobic attack. Earlier this year the Empire actor, who is black and gay, revealed he had been a victim of a hate crime which left him briefly hospitalised.

Weeks after an initial report was filed by Smollett, rumours that he may have orchestrated his own attack have escalated.

Although exactly what happened on the night of the alleged attack remains unclear, both Smollett and his lawyers have refuted all claims that he had any prior knowledge of the incident.

As Chicago Police continue to investigate the situation, here’s what we know so far:

What happened on the day of the alleged attack?

On January 29, Jussie Smollett told authorities that he was attacked by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs."" Police were told that the two men yelled “Empire f****t” and “Empire n****r” while physically assaulting him.

Smollett also told police that a rope was put around his neck and a chemical substance poured over him. In follow-up interviews with Smollett by authorities, the actor reportedly said one of the attackers shouted “This is MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ campaign slogan.

After the attack became public knowledge, celebrities including Alicia Keys and co-star Taraji P. Henson rallied in support of the Empire star.

“We all feel his pain right now,” wrote Henson in an Instagram post.

“@jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!!”

After observing CCTV footage of the area, police found no footage of the attack that had supposedly taken place. They did, however, locate two shadowed figures spotted walking down a sidewalk in the CCTV footage.

A few days later police arrested two Nigerian men, Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, in connection with the attack. Following further investigation by authorities, it emerged that the two brothers knew the actor, having both featured as extras on Empire.

Why do some people think the attack is actually a hoax?

Doubts about the validity of Smollett’s claims began to emerge after the brothers were released without charges on Friday, a decision which Chicago Police said was driven by the discovery of “new evidence.” Media outlets such as CBS Chicago and ABC7 ran stories suggesting Smollett may have been behind the attack.

The ABC7 article read: “Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News that police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of ‘Empire.’”

In a subsequent interview with ABC’s Good Morning America, Smollett's first since the incident took place, the actor revealed his anger over those casting doubt on his story. He said: “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, and that says a lot about the place we are in our country right now.”

He also dismissed reports that the attackers wore “Make America Great Again” hats, adding: “I never said that. I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

What have Chicago Police said?

Chicago Police are unwilling to confirm reports that the attack could have been orchestrated by Smollett.

In a tweet, Chicago Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said: “While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

In response to the rumours, Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said: “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The actor added he had been “forever changed” by the incident.

Who does Jussie Smollett play on Empire?

Smollett plays Jamal, a gay character, on the Fox hit show Empire.

The music-orientated show, which first aired on the network in 2015, follows the unconventional family drama of hip-hop mogul Lucious Lyon (Terrance Howard), his three sons and estranged wife Cookie, played by Taraji P Henson."

A grand jury may be taking on the Jussie Smollett case, reports TMZ.

Smollett, who is African American and gay, told Chicago Police that he was attacked by two white men late last month. He said the men put a noose around his neck and yelled, ""This is MAGA country.""

Sources have told Fox 32 News that evidence shows Smollett may have paid two brothers from Nigeria to fake the attack. Sources tell Fox 32 News that the men bought the rope for the noose at a local hardware store.

The brothers were taken into custody at O'Hare Airport when they returned from Nigeria. They were released without being charged.

Police responded on Sunday by saying they cannot confirm, deny or comment on what has been unofficially reported.

The CPD spokesman did say that detectives have some follow-up questions for Smollett.

Smollett's attorney, Todd Pugh, released a statement on Sunday saying:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to “unnamed” sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

These stirring images captured in war-torn Afghanistan give a rare insight into life on the frontline.

One image, taken by Australian photographer Gary Ramage, shows medics desperately fighting to save the life of a wounded marine as he makes his way to hospital via helicopter.

In another, a small girl can be seen looking on as a soldier takes aim at a suspected Taliban fighter in Helmand Province.

A flight medic and loadmaster are pictured attempting to save a marine's life while travelling at 160km/h, 30 metres off the ground

Further photos show medics hosing down a medical helicopter after it has been used to transport a wounded soldier.

'I am a combat photographer who has seen too much death,' Ramage writes in his book, The Shot.

'The first time was too much for me, and yet here I am, back in my comfort zone, where I will try my hardest and never be satisfied with what I have done.

'I am hard enough to endure this, yet also too soft. I can get through by reminding myself of the simple rule I live by: in wars, where nothing seems to matter, I can take pictures in which every person counts.'

Another snap shows a group of marines attempting to get some rest in a compound in Helmand Province

Ramage's book is an unflinching account of the trials and tribulations of a military photographer in the thick of the fighting, chronicling his time in conflict zones across the world.

Ramage has seen mass graves in Kosovo, famine in Somalia and horrific injuries in Afghanistan, where he says he saw three young men he was stationed with die in the space of three days.

But he said that, as difficult as it sometimes is for him to take a certain photo, he feels he has a duty to document what other people aren't there to see.

'In the end, we're (combat photographers) telling stories,' he says.

'We can enlighten, educate, titillate, entertain and outrage. But if we don't tell a story, no one looks at the picture or reads the words. We use all of our skills, talent, access and experience to make you stop and look.

'And if I do my job right, you'll get the flavour of where I've been, and what I've seen, but endure none of the turmoil I endured to make that picture.

'As all photographers know, with great power comes great responsibility.'

Both Rod Dreher, author of The Benedict Option: A Strategy for Christians in a Post-Christian Nation, and Daily Caller reporter Jen Kerns saw their articles censored on Facebook.

“You are not allowed to say on Facebook that Jussie Smollett carried out a hate hoax,” Dreher tweeted on Sunday with a screenshot of Facebook blocking his article at The American Conservative.

According to the screenshot, Facebook blocked the article because it appeared to be “spam” and said the post “goes against our Community Standards.”

Facebook lifted the ban later on Sunday.

On Saturday, lawyer Harmeet K. Dillon shared the news that Jen Kerns’s article had been blocked, also allegedly for “violating community standards.”

My friend @JenKernsUSA’s incisive column on #jussiesmolett and the hoaxes of the past, has been blocked by @facebook for “violating community standards” — but you can read and share it here — https://t.co/qHkRBzdP6x — Harmeet K. Dhillon (@pnjaban) February 16, 2019

Rudy Takala also reported that Jen Kerns had been banned on Instagram.

Both @Facebook and @Instagram have been on a roll trying to censor conservative writers this weekend. First they blocked @JenKernsUSA and froze her Instagram account over this column on Jussie Smollett. https://t.co/A62kGjAfPR — August Takala (@RudyTakala) February 17, 2019

Jen Kerns shared screenshots of the ban with PJ Media. Kerns told PJ Media that Facebook would not allow her to post the article as early as Friday.

Hey @Tyler2ONeil I sure do. This was on Friday- it remained blocked thru Sunday. I believe it was Harmeet’s Tweet ragging Facebook that got their attention. Thanks for your coverage! pic.twitter.com/V3AuP5EpOe — Jennifer Kerns (@JenKernsUSA) February 18, 2019

Then when she tried to put the article in her Instagram bio, Instagram booted her from the account until she removed the link.

When I simply put the Daily Caller link in my Bio (so I could post “Link in Bio👆🏼) I noticed it froze my account- Instagram wouldn’t allow me to comment on other pages, & would not allow others to comment on mine. I could not use Instagram again until I removed it. Their message: pic.twitter.com/WE5OOvcwFs — Jennifer Kerns (@JenKernsUSA) February 18, 2019

Rod Dreher’s article merely shared the previous reporting on the case, with a few paragraphs of his opinion sprinkled in. Jen Kerns compared the Jussie Smollett apparent hoax with the 1980s hoax perpetrated by Tawana Brawley.

In a follow-up article about the Facebook ban, Rod Dreher attempted to make sense of Facebook’s decision.

I fully support Facebook or any other social medium having a policy of banning certain material (porn, neo-Nazi propaganda, etc.). But when you can’t talk about hate hoaxes in general, or about a celebrated hate hoax in particular? Presumably my blog post violated Facebook’s “hate speech” prohibition (I can’t find any of their other Community Standards that it might have violated). Facebook’s policy on “hate speech” is here. This, I suppose, is what my blog post violated: But the entire reason for the post is new evidence indicating that Jussie Smollett was NOT a victim of a hate crime, but rather faked a hate crime!

The move indeed seems rather head-scratching.

Facebook also censored a pair of conservative articles last August as news broke surrounding the Paul Manafort conviction and the Michael Cohen guilty plea. Both articles countered the prevailing liberal narrative about these events.

It seems these bouts of censorship are likely caused by liberal Facebook users marking articles as “spam.” The social media company later removed the blocks, but censoring articles in the hours after their publication does a serious disservice in the news industry, where fresh information has the most pertinent impact.

Even if Facebook is not behind the initial decision to block, the company should make sure the posts are “spam” before blocking them, rather than allowing some Social Justice Warrior to silence news on the internet.

Jussie Smollett, an actor on the Fox series Empire, said two white men attacked him. They punched him, threw bleach on him, and then put a rope around his neck.

“This is MAGA country,” one of the alleged attackers said. This occurred on January 29. Well, there’s been a lot of trouble corroborating this attack with evidence. First, Smollett was hesitant to turn over his cell phone. He was speaking with his agent when he was reportedly attacked. Then, the two suspects turned out to be two Nigerian brothers, who knew Smollett; one of which was an extra on Empire. They reportedly bought the rope that was used in the alleged assault, paid by Smollett to attack him, and even rehearsed it. CBS Chicago later reported that the rope was actually bought Crafty Beaver Hardware Store and that Smollett was the one who paid for it:

Shocked, I really thought MAGA folks (who are all over downtown Chicago) were waiting with a rope/bottle of bleach to ambush a righ guy at 2am in minus 4 degrees because those are conditions where all people go out for Subway rather than order Seamless.

Seemed so real?????? https://t.co/E4z9aaX5v1 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 17, 2019

Jussie Smollett paid two brothers to stage an attack against him, directed them to buy items used in the alleged assault and actually rehearsed it with them, sources say. Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25. The brothers, who were questioned by police this week before being released, were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return. They left for Nigeria later in the day on Jan. 29, after the attack. Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett. The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening.

The New York Times has a timeline of this alleged hate crime that’s quickly devolving into a total fiasco. Police raided the brothers’ apartment on February 13; they went from persons of interest to suspects. They were then arrested on February, then released without charge, and not considered suspects anymore. No reason was given.

The fact remains that this investigation has gone from possible hate crime to whether it was orchestrated. And with these latest developments, has Smollett made time to speak with Chicago authorities again? He has not (via Deadline):

Things may be moving towards some sort of formal prosecution in the Jussie Smollett alleged attack case but Chicago PD have definitely yet to have a new sit-down with the Empire actor as more “developments” come to the surface. As rumors swirl of a Grand Jury being convened soon on what was once classified as a “potential hate crime” on January 29, the Windy City cops said Sunday that they “cannot confirm any details as the investigation is still on-going.” However, a well-placed law enforcement source tells Deadline that despite emerging and complicating evidence and requests for a further formal interview, Smollett has not made himself available “in a timely fashion” to investigators. “There are a lot of questions that need to be answered, and a sense of frustration with the response by Smollett and his lawyers,” the source stated.

Gee—I wonder why he might be ducking another visit. On the other hand, Empire’s showrunner tweeted support for Smollett, saying he believed him. That’s fine, but belief is not evidence.

Smollett said he thought he was attacked because of his criticisms of the Trump administration. Save it, buddy. It's not looking good for you at all."

DailyMail.com has learned that Smollett landed in Chicago shortly after midnight following a lengthy plane delay out of LaGuardia.

He had been in New York City for a reading of the play Take Me Out, with sources telling DailyMail.com that Smollett was being considered to appear in a possible revival of the Tony-winning production about a biracial baseball star who comes out as gay.

The script for that play finds the lead character being attacked by a new pitcher who joins the team. That character uses the same racial slurs Smollett told police his attackers screamed at him, including 'f****t' and 'n****r.'

The characters also play for the New York Empires.

There were reports that Jussie would be meeting with local authorities on Monday, but his new rep Anne Kavanaugh shot that down in a statement, saying: 'There are no plans for Jussie to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett's attorneys will keep dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.'

Scroll down for video

Where's Jussie? Smollett posted multiple Instagram stories on the night of his alleged assault, which investigators believe were made to alert brothers Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo (two stories above)

Broadway: Smollett appeared in a reading of the Tony-winning play Take Me Out the day before his attack, about a biracial baseball player coming out as gay (the 2003 cast of Take Me Out above)

The sources DailyMail.com spoke to said that this reading was just the initial stage of a possible revival of the production, which in 2003 won three Tony Awards for Best Play, Best Director (Joe Mantello) and Best Featured Actor (Dennis O'Hare).

Two readings were done by the actors in attendance, which included Zachary Quinto, on the morning and afternoon of January 28.

Quinto would later speak out about the attack on Smollett, saying: 'I was absolutely enraged by the injustice and the senselessness of such violence. but i was also vividly reminded that we MUST continue our fight for equality and acceptance at every turn in this country and in this world.

'When talented and courageous young men like jussie are targeted and struck down in our streets - we must collectively RISE UP against such hatred and be IDENTIFIED and be PROUD and be STRONG in our convictions of truth and self-love and love for one another.'

Once that second reading of the play wrapped, Smollett headed off to LaGuardia Airport for the flight back to Chicago, where he was set to film the final episodes of Empire's fourth season.

He had been set to arrive back in the Windy City on the evening of January 28, but got held up when his flight was delayed while he and the other passengers sat on the tarmac.

That is when Smollett started to post Instagram stories, first noting that there was a delay, and then again posting when two hours after boarding the plane had still not taken off for its destination.

Another post went up when the plane finally did leave, which was followed by his final post of the night when he landed after midnight in Chicago.

Th night of: Smollett posted on Instagram after arriving in Chicago around midnight, complaining about the cold weather

A source with knowledge of the investigation told DailyMail.com that investigators now believe these stories were all posted so Smollett could alert the men ahead of the attack.

Furthermore, they also believe that this could explain why a woman in Smollett's building said she saw two men with a rope hanging around near the residences approximately 90 minutes before the incident.

Smollett then went to Subway when he arrived home at 2am, despite the fact that it was 10 degrees in Chicago at the time.

A spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department was unable to confirm any of these details due to the ongoing investigation.

'While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include additional investigation and speaking to the individual who reported the incident,' Officer Anthony Guglielmi told DailyMail.com on Monday.

Smollett meanwhile continues to deny that the attack was stage or planned and has hired the same criminal defense attorney used by President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.

Persons of interest: The brothers were believe to be seen walking across the street from Smollett just before the attack (surveillance video above)

Smollett made little mention of President Trump in his report to police, but did speak about him multiple times when he was interviewed by Robin Roberts on Good Morning America two weeks after the incident.

It was during that interview that Smollett said for the first time that the two men who attacked him screamed out 'This is MAGA country,' but denied a TMZ story that the men were wearing red MAGA hats.

Smollett also said: 'I come really, really hard against [Trump]. I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don't hold my tongue.'

He did acknowledge however that President Trump did address the alleged attack, calling it 'horrible' and saying 'it does not get worse' the day after the incident.

'I don’t know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it,' said Smollett.

Roberts asked Smollett about his anger later in the interview, and what was upsetting him the most in the wake of the incident.

'Attackers, but it’s also the attacks. It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ""Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, because it’s the truth."" Then it became a thing of like, ""Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you– how do you not believe that? It’s the truth,""' said Smollett.

'And then it became a thing of like, ""Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.""'

Roberts was later forced to speak about the interview when new details emerged regarding the validity of Smollett's claims.

'When I sat down with Jussie it was Tuesday night in Chicago, at the time to give his first account, publicly give his first account of what he said happened,' explained Roberts.

'And we have to remember, at that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.'

Those brothers were identified by DailyMail.com as Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo.

The two were picked up by authorities last Wednesday after landing in Chicago after a week-long trip to Nigeria.

Investigators detained them for 48 hours after finding probable cause that they may be involved in a reported battery, but then released them without charge on Friday evening.

It was at that time that the police department announced there had been a 'shift' in the investigation and a desire to interview Smollett once again, having previously noted his unwillingness to hand over his phone during the probe.

Smollett's lawyer responded to claims that the attack was faked by stating: 'Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.'"

According to WBTV, a woman named Deidra Dickens bought tickets for herself and husband Eddie Dickens to see the famed comedian perform at the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center on Feb. 14.

Last night we told you this Charlotte couple was scammed out of hundreds of dollars trying to buy @DaveChappelle tickets on Craigslist. Tonight we were there as DAVE HIMSELF hand-delivered the group tickets! Awesome! @WBTV_News pic.twitter.com/tHMElvDcZE — Alex Giles WBTV (@AlexGilesNews) February 15, 2019

Deidra Dickens thought the tickets would be the ideal Valentine’s Day gift, because her husband is a huge Chappelle fan. But the wife and mother missed the opportunity to purchase tickets at the box office or another way, so searched on Craigslist and found four.

The tickets were perfect for her circumstances, too, because her husband uses a wheelchair and one of the seats was in the outer aisle, which would allow him to use that seat and access his wheelchair simultaneously. She also wanted to purchase the other two tickets for another couple.

So through Apple Pay, Dickens wired the supposed seller $500 but never received tickets or further communication.

“I was having good faith and it cost me $500. You have no empathy or goodness, or I don’t know, maybe no soul,” she said about the fraudster.

But as Dickens later found out, there are plenty of folks who have a good soul, and Chappelle seems to be one of them, because he delivered the tickets to her personally.

At the time, the only thing they knew was someone anonymous was paying for their meal at the Omni Charlotte Hotel and giving them tickets to the show. But they had no idea it would be the legendary comedian.

“Always get your tickets from a reliable source,” Chappelle told them as he approached.

Afterward, Chappelle talked about his kind act.

“It felt good. It feels like I was able to make something wrong right,” he told WBTV. “Someone on my team called me and told me about this situation, and we thought it’d be fun to do that for someone for Valentine’s Day. Take every opportunity that’s presented to you to be kind, especially if it’s something that’s easy to do.”

“He didn’t have to do that,” Eddie Dickens said in an interview afterward.

As for the Charlotte show itself, it’s been reported that Chappelle covered a wide array of current topics, including the Jussie Smollett case.

During his set, reports came in that police were considering whether the “Empire” actor fabricated his account of being beaten by two men.

Chappelle said he wanted to break a dollhouse over Smollett’s head for being untruthful.

Empire Actor Jussie Smollett’s story about being the victim of a hate crime seems to be unraveling. At first, Smollett told Chicago police that he was attacked on the street by Donald Trump, who shouted racial and anti-gay slurs in a language believed to be ancient Babylonian spoken backwards while his head rotated 360 degrees.

Mainstream news agencies immediately ran with the story, and Congressman Adam Schiff called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to imprison the president, telling CNN he had personally seen evidence that the attack was real but couldn’t reveal what it was because then everyone would know he was lying.

After police began to investigate, Smollett changed his story, saying his attacker wasn’t Trump but just someone who shouted “This is MAGA country,” narrowing the suspect list down to people who didn’t realize they were in Chicago. Smollett said the attacker hadn’t used a racial slur exactly but had harshly criticized the season one finale of Empire as implausible, then demanded Smollett put the accent of his name on the first syllable like a normal person and stop trying to be such a fancypants.

Police identified two amorphous shapes of interest on a blurry security video and Smollett said he was sure they were the attackers because they looked exactly like two guys no one would ever be able to find. Then the Chicago Police, who said they had nothing else to do since most of the city’s other residents were dead of gunshot wounds for some reason, actually found the shapes, who turned out to be two African dudes who say Smollett hired them to attack him.

In the aftermath, Don Lemon went on a show he apparently has and denounced President Trump for being so evil that people have to make up stories about him just to describe how evil he is.

So basically it’s been a typical news day."

Camerota added that even her bosses at CNN advised “to pump the brakes a little bit” on commenting on the story because of its oddities.

“I remember in the hours right after this happened that CNN … our bosses were advising to pump the brakes a little bit because there were things already that didn’t add up,” Camerota told fellow CNN anchor Brian Stelter. “I was frankly surprised how many people jumped on board to side with Jussie Smollett before there were photos, before there were police statements, before all that stuff. And so, how do you think this all — what was the trajectory of how this went wrong?”

“Yeah, the headline was so sensational and so disturbing,” Stelter replied. “It first came out on TMZ — not only that Smollett said he’d been attacked, but the attacker said this is MAGA country. Well, obviously, Chicago at 2:00 in the morning is not MAGA country, so that didn’t make sense in the first place.”

As of now, it looks as though police believe Empire star Smollett not only lied about a phony hate crime committed against him by supporters of President Trump, he also hoped to arrange for the hoax to be recorded by a surveillance camera.

According to CBS Chicago, Smollett, who is black and gay, paid $3500 to two brothers (who are also black) to stage a racist and homophobic attack on him.

If the reports are accurate, Smollett’s planning was meticulous, including rehearsals and the purchase of the items used in the attack.

Smollett claimed he was accosted by two men in downtown Chicago at about 1:30 a.m. on January 29. He told police his attackers recognized him, shouted racist and homophobic slurs, beat him up, poured bleach on him, wrapped a noose around his neck, and warned him that “This is MAGA country!”– a reference to the president’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Over the past 20 or so days, according to various media reports, the story has completely fallen apart.

Police sources tell CBS Chicago that the rope wrapped around Smollett’s neck was traced back to a purchase made by Smollett himself.

What’s more, a search of the brothers’ apartment turned up bleach, a red hat, and a script from Smollett’s TV show Empire. Apparently, one or both of the brothers worked on the show with Smollett.

CBS Chicago adds, “The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening.”

The most important dot to connect to all of the above, though, comes from Smollett himself, who told Good Morning America (GMA) last week that he suspected a surveillance camera caught the whole incident.

Speaking to GMA’s Robin Roberts, Smollett said, “And I looked up and I saw there was a camera directly on the light post that is in the intersection. So I’m like, ‘there it is!’… And then the detective told me that the camera inside of the casing was facing north, so they didn’t have it, and that was disappointing.”

That detail appears to stick in his craw. Later in the interview, unprompted, he brings it up again: “The camera facing north, how is that my issue?”

If these brothers are telling the truth that the attack was pre-planned, Smollett may have arranged for it to take place in a location where he assumed it would be recorded.

And one can imagine, had there been surveillance footage of the attack, the investigation would have proceeded very, very differently.

Once police had the footage, it would leak. Once cable and network news had the footage, it would loop endlessly. The fact that the two brothers are black wouldn’t matter. CBS Chicago reports that a black face mask was found in their apartment. Smollett told police the attackers wore face masks. With those face masks, the organized left (the media, Democrats, celebrities) were allowed to assume his racist attackers were white.

If local media reports prove true and Smollett did plan this, it’s easy to see what he could have gained — had the altercation occurred in front of any of the other cameras he walked past that night.

First off, he despises Trump and, it seems, Trump’s supporters, and this was an easy way to smear both, especially in a world with a corrupt media that is always eager to spread any kind of fake news or hoax that makes Trump or his supporters look evil.

There is also Smollett’s debut album, which is scheduled to hit store shelves on March 2, and the live performances promoting the album, which began just a few days after the attack.

Overall, it is just a fact that we now live in a media and entertainment culture where being a victim, most especially a black and gay victim of racist Trump supporters, assures you endless news cycles, worldwide fame, and unearned status as America’s conscience. Smollett may have not only believed his hoax would sell millions of albums but make him a civil rights hero — the kind of victim-icon offered a prime speaking slot at the 2020 Democrat National Convention, a potent weapon relentlessly wielded by the media to pummel Trump and his supporters.

Take a step back, though…

Take a step back and look at the fire Smollett was allegedly willing to play with…

Imagine what it would have done to this country and to the city of Chicago if the attack had been recorded, if an outlet like TMZ had leaked the video, and if the wildly irresponsible race baiters at CNN had broadcast that video over and over and over again — an endless loop of two men assaulting a gay, black man; pouring bleaching on him and tying a noose around his neck.

It would have been just like that other media hoax — “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” — and we all know what that led to: the destruction of a predominantly black neighborhood in the ensuing riots.

The American media are garbage.

Thank heaven the Chicago police are not.

Last week, Roberts conducted an interview with Smollett on “GMA,” during which she was accused of being “too soft” in her questioning of Smollett. Roberts addressed her sit-down with Smollett on Monday’s edition of “GMA” saying she found his story “credible.” (RELATED: Here All The Politicians Who Rushed To Judgment On The Smollett ‘Hate Crime’)

“When I sat down with Jussie, it was Tuesday night in Chicago, at the time to give his first account — publicly give his first account — of what he said happened,” Roberts said. “And we have to remember, at that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers. ”

In the interview with Roberts that aired last Thursday, Smollett stridently defended his story while criticizing his doubters. He also continued to insinuate that supporters of President Donald Trump were responsible for his “attack,” which is now believed to be a hoax.

“I come really really hard against 45,” Smollett said when asked by Roberts why he was targeted. “I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

In the days following the interview, reports have emerged from the Chicago Police Department stating that they have reason to believe the actor paid two Nigerian brothers (who were also extras on “Empire”) to help stage the attack. Smollett and his lawyers continue to deny reports that he staged the encounter and are sticking with their account of the events.

5am – D/E MCCABE’S INTERVIEW ON 60 MINUTES:

McCabe says Rosenstein sought to oust Trump from office. (Washington Times) — Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said Sunday that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was so serious about using the 25th Amendment to oust President Trump, he was counting “votes or possible votes” among Cabinet members. In an interview with “60 Minutes” to promote his upcoming book, Mr. McCabe said Mr. Rosenstein offered to wear a wire during his next meeting with Mr. Trump. The reason, Mr. McCabe said, was because Mr. Rosenstein wanted to learn the president’s motivation for firing former FBI Director James B. Comey in the early stages of what would ultimately become special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia collusion probe. “Now he was not joking,” Mr. McCabe said. “He was absolutely serious. And, in fact, he brought it up in the next meeting we had. I never actually considered him taking him up on the offer.” The recording would have been to collect evidence on whether Mr. Comey’s firing amounted to obstruction of justice, according to Mr. McCabe. When that idea was shot down, Mr. McCabe said, Mr. Rosenstein discussed invoking the 25th Amendment. The amendment is a process for the Cabinet to force the removal of a president they consider unable to perform the duties of the office. “To be fair, it was an unbelievably stressful time,” Mr. McCabe said. “I can’t even describe for you how many things must have been coursing through the deputy attorney general’s mind at that point.” Mr. Rosenstein has called the allegations “inaccurate and factually incorrect.” Last fall, a Justice Department official dismissed a report in The New York Times claiming Mr. Rosenstein offered to wear a wire as a joke.

McCabe, speaking to CBS News’ “60 Minutes,” recounted a conversation soon after Comey’s firing about the ongoing Russia investigation in which he said Rosenstein told him: “I never get searched when I go into the White House.

6am – A/B/C CBS CHICAGO: Jussie Smollett Case: Brothers Questioned By Police Were Paid $3,500 To Stage Attack, Which Was Rehearsed Days Before, Sources Say. CHICAGO (CBS) — Jussie Smollett paid two brothers to stage an attack against him, directed them to buy items used in the alleged assault and actually rehearsed it with them, sources say. Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25. The brothers, who were questioned by police this week before being released, were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return. They left for Nigeria later in the day on Jan. 29, after the attack. Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett. The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening.

6am – D INTERVIEW – JOHN LOTT – President, Crime Prevention Research Center and author of “The War on Guns” — discussed the Illinois shooting.

Aurora shooter brought gun to termination meeting, opened fire as soon as he was fired, police say. A disgruntled worker who went on a shooting rampage at a manufacturing warehouse in a Chicago suburb brought the weapon to his termination meeting and opened fire as soon as he was fired, police say. Gary Martin, 45, was killed by police after he shot five people dead at the Henry Pratt Company on Friday in Aurora and injured 11, including five police officers. Officers believe that at least several of Martin’s victims were those present during his termination meeting, according to a statement obtained by CNN. Martin worked for the plant for 15 years, and his firing was the result of multiple workplace rule violations, according to Scott Hall, the CEO of Mueller Water Products, which owns Henry Pratt Company.

HE SHOULDN’T HAVE HAD A GUN : To own a gun, Illinois residents are required to have a Firearms Owners’ Identification, or FOID, card issued by the state. Martin had legally obtained a FOID card in January 2014 and bought a Smith & Wesson .40-caliber handgun in March of that year, police said. Days after buying the gun, he applied for a conceal-carry permit. Police discovered a 1995 conviction for felony aggravated assault in Mississippi — an offense they said might not have turned up on the background check necessary for a FOID card. Police revoked his FOID card and sent him a letter telling him to relinquish any firearms. Ziman said police records show that the letter was sent, but she doesn’t know whether police attempted to follow up.

6am – E KAEPERNICK

Colin Kaepernick and the N.F.L. Settle Collusion Case: In a terse joint statement issued on Friday afternoon, the league and the players’ lawyers said that “the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances” and that “there will be no further comment.” A confidentiality agreement means that, for all the debate and discussion the case generated, it ended with a silence that left hanging whether the league admitted there was any collusion and whether Mr. Kaepernick would ever play another down.

In a terse joint statement issued on Friday afternoon, the league and the players’ lawyers said that “the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances” and that “there will be no further comment.” A confidentiality agreement means that, for all the debate and discussion the case generated, it ended with a silence that left hanging whether the league admitted there was any collusion and whether Mr. Kaepernick would ever play another down. The NFL foolishly settles lawsuit with Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid (by Tom Joyce) — Friday was payday for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid, a defensive back for the Carolina Panthers. The two filed separate collusion grievances against the NFL, and the league opted to settle with both of them, according to ESPN. The players alleged that because Kaepernick started the NFL’s national anthem kneeling epidemic in 2016 and Reid, who was also a 49er at the time, was among the first to join him, that they were targeted unjustly by owners who wanted to keep them out of the league. “For the past several months, counsel for Mr. Kaepernick and Mr. Reid have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL,” the players’ attorney Mark Geragos and the NFL said a joint statement issued Friday, according to ESPN. “As a result of those discussions, the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances. The resolution of this matter is subject to a confidentiality agreement so there will be no further comment by any party.” The exact figures are still unclear on how much each player received. However, Bleacher Report’s Mike Freeman reported Kaepernick’s settlement is somewhere in the $60 million to $80 million range. Ultimately, the whole thing is ridiculous. Neither player deserves lawsuit money from the NFL when they hurt the league’s bottom line.

6am – F Ja Rule planning another Fyre Festival-type music event (PageSix) — It appears nothing, not even prison time for Billy McFarland, can stop Ja Rule from making Fyre Festival a reality. The rapper talked to TMZ at LAX and shared that he’s planning a Fyre Festival-type music event, presumably without the fraud. Ja Rule didn’t give too many details about what’s in store for his future music festival, but it appears to be in the works. “[Fyre] is the most iconic festival that never was,” he told the outlet. “I have plans to create the iconic music festival, but you didn’t hear it from me.” The 42-year-old rapper also said he’s recently launched a new app, Icon, that’s similar to McFarland’s Fyre app, but he assured it won’t turn out to be anything sketchy. “[Fyre Festival] is heartbreaking to me. It was something that I really, really wanted to be special and amazing, and it just didn’t turn out that way, but you know in the midst of chaos there’s opportunity, so I’m working on a lot of new things,” he shared. “I’ve got my new platform, Icon, rebranded and rebuilt and it’s an amazing platform. It’s for artists.” “It is kind of similar to what the [Fyre] app was, but you have to understand the app was separate from the festival,” he clarified. “Different teams working on the app than the festival and the whole nine.” Although Ja Rule was working with McFarland, the “Livin’ It Up” rapper blasted the Hulu and Netflix documentaries that cast him in a bad light.

DIGENOVA: If Trump declares a national emergency over the border, he’ll be on solid legal ground

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle spoke out on Sunday talk shows about President Trump’s emergency declaration to fund construction of a wall along the southern border. The Democratic-controlled House is expected to pass a resolution rebuking the declaration within weeks. The measure would then head to the Senate, where several of the chamber’s 53 Republicans have expressed unease with the precedent Trump’s decision sets.

7am – D INTERVIEW – JANE HAMPTON COOK – presidential historian, author of The Burning of the White House and former White House staffer for President George W. Bush – reflected on Presidents Day.

PRESIDENTS DAY aka GEORGE WASHINGTON’S BIRTHDAY: Washington’s Birthday is a United States federal holiday celebrated on the third Monday of February in honor of George Washington, the first President of the United States, who was born on February 22, 1732. Since the Uniform Federal Holidays Act of 1971, its observance can occur between February 15 and 21 inclusive. Colloquially, the day is also now widely known as Presidents’ Day and is often an occasion to honor the incumbent president and all persons who have served as president, not just George Washington.

Students Demand George Washington University Change ‘Colonials’ Mascot. Students at George Washington University are demanding the school change its mascot, the “Colonials,” arguing the nickname may “discourage” students, due to not being “inclusive.” Students suggest changing the mascot to a “hippo” or “riverhorse” instead. Now, student senator Hayley Margolis, is seeking to restart the push to remove the Colonial, according to The GW Hatchet.Margolis hosted a panel last week — sponsored by the GW Student Association — to discuss whether or not the GW mascot is “inclusive,” by engaging in “critical conversation about GW school spirit and what the GW Colonial connotes.” “Together, let’s decide if the colonial is the best identity for community school spirit,” reads the event description, insisting that students, staff, and community members should discuss “what it means to be a colonial in an academic, historical, and contemporary context.” Margolis told The GW Hatchet, that GW’s team name, the Colonials, may discourage students from having “inclusive” school spirit, as the mascot might make them think about oppression and the hatred of a different race. “The historically, negatively-charged figure of Colonials has too deep a connection to colonization and glorifies the act of systemic oppression,” continues the petition, “Alternative nickname recommendations are ‘Hippos,’ ‘Revolutionaries,’ or ‘Riverhorses.’”

7am – E Has Trump wrecked our sex life? “Post-Trump Sex Disorder” is real, says sex therapist. “Big Mean Sexy Daddy”? Salon turns to Dr. Susan Block for answers to questions you didn’t want to ask. (Salon.com) — Donald Trump has made America’s mental health crisis much worse. Beginning with his presidential campaign and through to his third year as president, the United States has experienced an increase in anxiety, suicide, depression, and other mental health problems. The president of the United States is also a role model. His or her behavior influences the public. And as documented by Dr. James Gilligan in his book “Why Some Politicians are More Dangerous Than Others,” Trump’s assault on the country’s mental health is part of a much larger pattern: the Republican Party and the conservative movement have, for decades, advanced an agenda which has hurt the overall health and well-being of most Americans. Donald Trump’s negative impact on mental health extends to the intimate sexual lives of many people as well. What is “Post-Traumatic Trump Disorder”? How does Donald Trump’s misogyny and other unhealthy behavior towards women reflect deeper systemic cultural problems in America around gender, sex, and intimacy? In an effort to answer these questions I recently spoke with Dr. Susan Block. “Dr. Suzy” is the founder and director of the Dr. Susan Block Institute for the Erotic Arts & Sciences. Block is perhaps most well-known for her HBO TV special “Radio Sex TV with Dr. Susan Block,” and appearances on HBO series such as “Real Sex” and “Cathouse.” She’s also a New York Times bestselling author and has been a frequent guest on such TV shows and networks as Oprah, Nightline, and MTV. Her most recent book is “The Bonobo Way: The Evolution of Peace through Pleasure.” How has the Age of Trump impacted the American people’s collective mental health and also their intimate lives? It has had a big impact. For some people Trump’s campaign and presidency has created a type of PTSD — what I call “Post-Trump Sex Disorder.” Trump has created feelings of fear, loathing, and nausea. People just don’t want to have sex. This would mainly be seen with women who are just appalled at how creepy Trump is. He takes what is often a positive male attribute of confidence and pushes it way over the line into a rape-like and rape-entitled kind of arrogance.

JOHN MALCOLM: Trump Has a Strong Legal Argument That He Can Declare National Emergency at Border

8am – E Virginia lawmakers approve use of speed cameras — in limited circumstances. (Washington Post) — Virginia lawmakers have approved legislation to allow the commonwealth’s first speed-camera program, a significant shift for the state, which has been slow to embrace technology that has long been used by law enforcement in the District, Maryland and elsewhere. The legislation, if signed by Gov. Ralph Northam, would allow Virginia State Police troopers to use the cameras only in highway work zones. A trooper’s vehicle would have to have its blue flashing lights activated — and signs warning of camera use would have to be placed within 1,000 feet of the work zone. Tickets would be issued for vehicles traveling at least 12 mph over the posted speed limit. As in Maryland and the District, the $125 citation would be sent by mail. State Sen. Bill Carrico (R-Grayson), the legislation’s sponsor, said in bill hearings that drivers would be able to contest the fine. A spokeswoman for Northam (D) said he “will review this bill once it reaches his desk,” but she declined to say whether the governor supports the measure. Although the program would be limited in its scope, it would signal an important tryout of automated enforcement in Virginia after years of opposition to plans for widespread deployment of speed cameras. “It’s a good start. It at least gets people used to notion of cameras recording their license plates, but it is only a baby step,” said Paul F. Reynolds, a professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Virginia, who has studied speeding in the Charlottesville area and has advocated for the use of speed cameras in the state. More than 130 communities throughout the United States have speed-camera programs and 422 have red-light cameras, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Maryland and the District are known as national leaders in their use of automated speed enforcement. In Virginia, several proposals for use of the technology on state highways and near school zones have failed in recent years. The work-zone bill, however, was easily approved, with lawmakers citing the dangers of work zones due to lane shifts and uneven pavement, as well as the need to protect workers."

At least five people are dead and entire villages are feared destroyed after the worst tropical cyclone in Fiji's history.

Locals, tourists and aid workers are waking to scenes of utter destruction after a category five cyclone battered the South Pacific nation with wind gusts as strong as 325km/h and waves up to 12m high.

'The scale of the destruction is absolutely massive and it's still far too early to tell just how many people's homes and livelihoods have been devastated by this storm,' Australian Red Cross aid worker Susan Slattery told AAP from Suva.

Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama confirmed the death toll and declared a 30-day state of emergency, with schools ordered to shut and a nationwide curfew extended until Monday morning.

'When we are able we will provide timelines for the return of water and power,' he said, adding that electricity supply to some areas had been deliberately cut to avert further damage.

More than 8,100 people remain stranded in evacuations centres across Fiji after Tropical Cyclone Winston battered the island nation on Saturday.

Winds reached speeds of up to 330 kilometres per hour (200mph) while waves of up to 12 metres battered the coast cutting communication for the some 900,000 residents braving the category five storm.

Officials from the National Disaster Management Office say the death toll has risen from 17 to 21, with four people still missing at sea, the ABC reported.

'This number is bound to change as we progress,' an NDMO spokesman said.

'Australia's thoughts are with the people of Fiji, particularly those who have lost family and friends as a result of Tropical Cyclone Winston, the largest recorded cyclone to hit the country,' she said.

Ten fatalities occurred in Ra, Nadi and Lautoka and were caused mainly by flying debris and storm surges.

There are also fears for seven fishermen from the Yasawas now believed to be missing at sea.

The severe tropical cyclone, the strongest ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, flattened scores of homes, crippled infrastructure and forced hundreds of terrified Fijians to shelter in evacuation centres.

'The Fijians are desperately trying to repair severed lines of communication, but they hold grave fears that the news waiting for them will be dire,' she said.

International tourists caught up in the disaster began to leave on Monday as flights resumed at Nadi airport after a two-day suspension.

Air New Zealand confirmed one of its aircraft departed at 9.30am and Virgin Australia said all flights between Nadi and Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane would operate as scheduled.

Fiji Airways is operating scheduled flights between Nadi and Auckland and some flights between Nadi and Sydney, with some cancelled and others delayed by about four hours.

Jetstar cancelled its Monday flights between Sydney and Nadi and expects to resume flights on Tuesday. The airline will update travellers again at on Monday afternoon.

That’s what the Washington Examiner says has been accrued by “a video of actress Ellen Page blaming President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for the alleged assault on ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett.” There’s just one huge problem: “The number takes on new significance … as new reports says two brothers told authorities that Smollett allegedly paid them to stage the attack.” But despite the media’s cursory and knee-jerk reporting, don’t expect any major concessions. Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deleted a sympathetic tweet without so much as an acknowledgment or apology.

Tone deaf: “Speaking on German soil 75 years after the U.S. and its allies prepared for D-Day, Joe Biden described America as ‘an embarrassment’ and its trade policies ‘self-defeating.’ … The former vice president was speaking exactly three-quarters of a century after American troops were fighting against Germans at the Battle of Anzio and Allied military staffs were deep into planning for the D-Day invasion of Normandy less than 4 months later.” (Washington Examiner)

Democrats were expeditious in instigating border-barrier lawsuits. According to USA Today, “At least two lawsuits have been filed in response to President Donald Trump on Friday declaring a national emergency to secure funding for a wall along the southern border with Mexico. The filings are expected to be part of a flurry of legal challenges to the constitutionality of Trump’s decision.” Legal challenges are also anticipated to come from citizens themselves. As Bloomberg reports, “Some landowners along the U.S.-Mexico line say they see a government land grab in their future.” But Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller this weekend pointed out, “This is a threat in our country, not overseas. And if the president can’t defend this country, then he cannot fulfill his constitutional oath of office.”

“President Trump’s pick to be the next United Nations ambassador withdrew from consideration Saturday, the State Department said. The department’s spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, had been tapped to succeed Nikki Haley at the United Nations, but her name was never formally sent to the Senate for confirmation. … The withdrawal is related to the employment of a nanny who was in the country illegally. … But according to a person familiar with Nauert’s situation, the nanny was in the country legally. She was a Jamaican national employed by Nauert and her husband 10 years ago.” (The Washington Post)

According to Fox News, “More men and boys from a Somali American community in Minneapolis have joined — or attempted to join — a foreign terrorist organization over the last 12 years than any other jurisdiction in the country. … So what has made the area such a hotbed for such activity? And what has been Rep. Ilhan Omar’s record in addressing the issue — either before she was elected, or since? The answers matter because federal authorities say they remain ‘highly concerned’ about the terrorist connection with the Minneapolis Somalis.” Omar’s anti-Semitism could be emblematic of an even bigger problem.

Too long coming: “Disgraced ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick has been expelled from the Roman Catholic priesthood after an investigation found sex abuse allegations against him were credible, the Vatican said Saturday. The church is penalizing McCarrick, the former Archbishop of Washington, D.C., and Newark, New Jersey, with ‘dismissal from the clerical state,’ it said in a statement. He will not be able to appeal the decision.” (NBC News)

A majority of Californians are inclined to put down roots elsewhere, new polling reveals. The catalyst is cost of living, which is particularly pronounced in San Fransisco. Perhaps voters should revisit partitioning the state.

Civics testing in the U.S. is less than mediocre. According to the Washington Examiner, “A majority in every state except Vermont has failed the U.S. Citizenship test, the latest sign that Americans aren’t very good history students. … More than half of those in every other state failed, and in Washington, D.C., 58 percent failed, said the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, which does the survey. Only one-in-four nationally passed the 20-questions.” This shouldn’t surprise us, though. Schools are more interested in “diversifying” restrooms and locker rooms than they are in fostering education.

A tragic mass shooting occurred Friday in Aurora, Illinois, where five innocent lives were taken and police officers were injured. But like many mass shootings, it could have been prevented via existing laws. Townhall reports that the shooter “purchased a Smith and Wesson .40 caliber handgun in 2014 but was later discovered to have been convicted of an aggravated assault charge back in 1995 when he tried to apply for a concealed carry permit. As a result, he should have turned his firearm over to authorities. He didn’t.”

Having your cake and eating it too: “The NFL and lawyers for players Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid jointly announced Friday that they had settled a complaint of collusion by the players, who claimed football team owners blackballed them,” CNBC reports. According to The Daily Wire, “All parties are prevented from revealing details of the settlement, by the settlement’s terms, but various news reports put the settlement between $60 million and $80 million split between the two players.” Furthermore, “Kaepernick’s attorney … told ESPN that he predicts Kaepernick will now be welcomed into the league with open arms.” On the contrary, why would any team want such a toxic charlatan?

“If it is found that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetrate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum,” the MSNBC host and civil rights leader said during a Sunday airing of his program “Politics Nation.”

Sharpton did not define what he meant by “maximum,” but filing a false policy report is a felony in Illinois and punishable by up to three years in prison, “GMA” reported earlier on Monday.

The MSNBC host however clearly stated that he was waiting for all the facts to come in and that whoever was at fault should face justice.

“I among many others when hearing of the reports said the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum. I still maintain that,” he said. “Let’s not act like this is some left wing hoax that some are saying on social media. President Trump called this horrible and he’s certainly not a left winger.”

On Jan. 29, Smollett first reported the attack to police saying that two men in MAGA hats and ski masks attacked him early in the morning near a Subway sandwich shop, shouting racial slurs and the line, “This is MAGA country.” For weeks, however, cops struggled to crack the case. Two persons of interest identified and arrested by the police were later released.

New reporting from CNN and local Chicago news sources later have said Smollett staged the attack with two person’s of interest — one of whom is known to have appeared in Empire as an extra. Reps for the Chicago PD told TheWrap Monday that they were “not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

In a weekend statement, attorneys for the actor, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, strongly denied the reporting from CNN and elsewhere saying Smollett “has been further victimized” by the claims."

For instance, you could pander to voters who think judicious silence and circumspection during a politically charged criminal investigation are what’s expected of a would-be national leader. Or you could pander to morons who demand a rush to judgment because the alleged crime in this case just so happens to confirm all of their political priors.

Or you could pander to … both? Here’s Spartacus three weeks ago:

As you’ll see below, now that Smollett’s claims may — or may not — have begun to fall apart, Booker’s suddenly in the wait-and-see category. It was fascinating this weekend watching the different strategies used by people who leaped at the Smollett story to backtrack as doubts about it increased. (I’d say “pounced on” the Smollett story but that term, like “seized on,” is reserved exclusively for righties who annoy the media by exploiting news that harms the left.) There’s the panicky “destroy the evidence” strategy:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deleted her original tweet sympathetic for “Empire” actor and singer Jussie Smollett amid reports that Smollett may have staged the alleged January 29 attack against himself… Politicians and celebrities alike rallied around Smollett, including Pelosi, who tweeted on January 29, “The racist, homophobic attack on [Smollett] is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love.”

There’s the “let’s deflect by making this about conservatives” strategy:

Watch below as Booker now very belatedly reserves judgment about Smollett in light of this weekend’s news — although not really. The crux of his comments are about the Larger Truth of Smollett’s story: Even if it’s not technically true that the actor was assaulted by a pair of Trump fans, it’s broadly true in the sense that right-wingers are America’s leading terrorists. This “fake but accurate” take if Smollett is revealed as a fraud will quickly become the progressive party line. There’ll be some obligatory “to be sure” harrumphing about how what Smollett did was wrong, but not an ounce of sympathy will be offered to Trump voters who were collectively blamed for the bogus attack.

However it shakes out, Smollett will end up as a bigger star than he was before. He’d be smart to double and triple down on his story no matter how much evidence the police produce against him. There’ll be a woke segment of the media that insists on believing him no matter what, if only to defend their own rush to judgment, with the police blamed for not recognizing “Jussie’s truth” or whatever. Remember the cardinal rule of America 2019: It can always get stupider. And it will."

It seems like the Chicago Police Department is becoming increasingly more frustrated with Jussie Smollett.

Hours after reports came out about the potential for a full grand jury investigation into the Empire actor’s alleged attack in Chicago late last month, police sources are now revealing serious frustrations with the actor.

Related: So Was This Attack Staged?!

Chicago PD sources confessed there’s a growing urgency within the investigation to get Smollett in for a second interview, after new developments have come to the surface about his alleged role in the attack itself.

And yet Smollett, through his legal team, has consistently denied the opportunity to take a second interview — something cops aren’t too crazy about.

A “well-placed source” spoke to Deadline about it on Sunday, sharing “a sense of frustration” with the fact that Smollett has “not made himself available in a timely fashion” to speak to investigators.

The source continued (below):

“There are a lot of questions that need to be answered, and a sense of frustration with the response by Smollett and his lawyers.”

Not a good thing…

Related: Police Investigation Into Attack Has Shifted

This new, deeper inquiry into Smollett’s alleged assault has cops re-focusing on the actor’s version of events, and police are reportedly increasingly skeptical that the Empire star may have had possible “pre-knowledge” of what was going to take place.

We’ll see if Smollett ultimately meets with cops to clear things up, or if he continues to take the advice of legal counsel to wait this out.

Meanwhile, Chicago PD’s Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi is still unable to state as of today whether the star is a victim, suspect, or person of interest, telling The Blast:

“We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with the Empire cast member before we can answer this question.”

Regardless, we no doubt haven’t heard the last of this case…

We’ll keep you updated throughout as more developments rise to the surface.

Mr. Smollett, 36, an openly gay African-American performer who plays a gay character on the musical hip-hop TV drama Empire, ignited a furor on social media last month when he reported he had been attacked on the street by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Mr. Smollett’s account, his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” before fleeing. Police said the actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt.

On Wednesday evening this week, police said they arrested two Nigerian brothers described as “persons of interest” who were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area of the alleged Jan. 29 assault.

The pair were freed two days later without charge, police told Reuters on Friday, in light of “new evidence” from their interrogation.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied a media report on Thursday that detectives were looking into whether Smollett had staged the attack, saying then that there was “no evidence to say this is a hoax.”

On Saturday, Guglielmi issued a brief statement saying that “information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He added, “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Attorneys for Mr. Smollett said in a statement late on Saturday that he was “angered and devastated” by recent reports that the alleged attackers were people he is familiar with, including a personal trainer he hired to prepare him for a music video.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” said the lawyers, Todd Pugh and Jonathan Brayman. — Reuters

Topic: The Jussie Smollett story — Over the weekend, Chicago Police said they have evidence that the accused perpetrators are now claiming that Smollett orchestrated his own attack. Smollett denies this claim.

S.E. Cupp: “The giddiness among Trumpsters over the Smollett news is gross. This story is awful. He allegedly abused police resources, exploited raw divisions in this country, and made it harder for every victim of a hate crime to report. This is sad no matter your politics.”

CJ Pearson: “S.E. is one of the most unbearable people in news. Stop blaming Trump supporters for the malfeasance of you and your colleagues. Admit you were wrong and move on.”

S.E. Cupp: “I didn’t blame Trump supporters for anything. And that you find me “unbearable” is boring. Just boring. Zzzzz”

CJ Pearson: “Your words: “The giddiness among Trump supporters over Smollett news is gross” Also, I’m not the only person who finds you boring. Check your ratings when you get a chance..”

S.E. Cupp: “Maybe you should check our ratings. My show beats Fox and MSNBC every night. Sometimes by double. Thanks for the shoutout.”

Fox News media reporter Brian Flood also weighed in here. He wrote, “S.E. Cupp, your network’s coverage of tonight’s news was pathetic.

It appears that most of the comments on Mahoney’s tweet are not as optimistic regarding Smollett’s account of what occurred on the night he says he was jumped by two men in Chicago.

As it turns out, Smollett knew the men, who are Nigerian brothers, and one was his personal trainer. The men, who were originally persons of interest and then suspects, were released from police custody after telling cops that Smollett paid them to stage the attack, per CNN.

That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

DuVernay was referring to the murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald at the hands of Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014. Initially, Chicago PD reported that McDonald was carrying a folding knife and walking erratically at the time he was shot, and ruled that the shooting was justified. But dash cam footage released a year later showed Van Dyke shooting McDonald while he was walking away, leading to the officer being charged with murder."

The black homosexual “Empire” actor claimed assailants in MAGA hats beat him, tied a noose around his neck, and doused him with bleach, allegedly while yelling, “This is MAGA country, nigger!” and calling him “Empire faggot!” But, as it turns out, it seems Smollett hired two Nigerians to play the part of Donald Trump-loving rednecks. Time to get someone from Central Casting on the line.

Through a statement from his attorneys, Smollett doubled down: “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” He had previously complained that people wouldn’t doubt his story if he “had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican.”

But new evidence indicates Smollett was angry after a racist letter sent to the show’s studio (a charade he allegedly also perpetrated) didn’t get a “bigger reaction,” so he is suspected of paying the two Nigerians to “attack” him a week later. There are also reports that Smollett scouted the location of the attack and rehearsed it.

One would think the Leftmedia might exercise a modicum of skepticism in the wake of incidents like the Covington Catholic phony narrative. But no.

The New York Times, ABC News, MSNBC, PBS, Los Angeles Times, and other Leftmedia propagandists all “reported” on the attack as if it were verified fact with nothing more than Smollett’s claims to back it up. GQ magazine even declared, “The racist, homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is far-right America’s endgame.” So now all conservatives are to blame.

It wasn’t just irresponsible news outlets with a “progressive” ax to grind, either. Multiple Democrat politicians — including members of the 2020 presidential field — unquestioningly took Smollett’s story as gospel truth. Cory Booker insisted, “The vicious attack on Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching.” Kamala Harris likewise chimed in, “This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.” Nancy Pelosi lectured, “The racist, homophobic attack on [Jussie Smollett] is an affront to our humanity.” And Joe Biden wasn’t to be left out: “What happened … to Jussie Smollett must never be tolerated in this country.”

A day later, Booker decided, “I’m gonna withhold until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.” Now he tells us.

Smollett’s desperate plea for attention, as Mark Alexander notes, “is likely the result of his gender dysphoric pathology and perhaps indicative of childhood trauma.” For sure, it fit neatly within the Left’s hate narrative about the Right and confirms preexisting bias, which stems from a history of misinformation from the media.

Smollett was not the victim of a hate crime; he perpetrated one.

Wilfred Reilly, political science professor at Kentucky State University, is author of Hate Crime Hoax — How the Left Is Selling a Fake Race War. Reilly notes, “Virtually all of the high profile widely-reported hate crimes over the last two years have been hoaxes. … A broader motivation for these hoaxes is that the demand for bigots in America greatly exceeds the supply.” (We have compiled a list of other notable hate-crime hoaxes.)

Bottom line: There are hateful people of every color out there. But hate-crime hoaxes undermine the concern we should all share for real victims.

Update Feb. 21: Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police this morning on felony charges of filing a false police report."

Storm Georgina has raged across Britain today with gusts of 90mph and two inches of rain, causing the closure of a central London tube station and widespread flooding.

Part of Charing Cross underground has been shut down by firefighters this afternoon amid concerns for public safety after metal slates on the roof became loose due to the wind. The closure comes just ahead of rush hour when millions of Londoners will start their journey home.

Meanwhile scores of flood alerts have been issued as the country faces a continued onslaught of heavy downpours. The Met Office has also issued a wind warning for Scotland and the Northern Ireland as well as a rain warning for northern England.

Photographs showed many parts of England including London being hit by heavy rain, while Cambridgeshire and Essex suffered flooding and planes struggled to land in strong crosswinds at Leeds Bradford Airport today.

It comes after the UK's warmest January day for two years yesterday, which saw Exeter get to 14.6C (58F) – the highest temperature for the month since January 24, 2016 when Achnagart in the Highlands got to 16.5C (62F).

The storm was named by Met Éireann for Ireland as it issued a warning for gusts which reached up to 75mph with widespread rain overnight. Gale-force winds thrashed the Atlantic coasts and temperatures dropped to 4C (40F).

The Met Office has issued a warning covering most of northern England for up to two inches of rain set to fall between 1am and 11am today, adding that 'flooding of a few homes and businesses is likely'.

The warning follows floods and landslides which hit Devon in heavy rain on Sunday, which fell as snow further north. A separate warning has been issued for 90mph gusts in Scotland up to 5pm today.

The Met Office says gales of 50mph, gusting to 60mph, could also occur across the North of England, and along the south coast through the day. Inland, wind speeds could reach 40mph even in southern England.

Met Office spokesman Nicola Maxey said: 'We are likely to have a low pressure system crossing the north of Scotland which is bringing these strong winds through today.

'With winds of those speeds, there is potential for fallen branches from tress and debris in the road so drivers should be aware and take precautions. The whole country is looking at a blustery day.'

Travel chaos between Edinburgh and Glasgow as trains are disrupted after mud and rocks fall onto the tracks A landslip has brought disruption to trains on the main line between Edinburgh and Glasgow today. Mud and rocks have fallen on to the tracks at Winchburgh leading to replacement buses and cancellations to some services. Scotrail said disruption is expected until the end of the day with trains between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh stopping at Linlithgow, with replacement buses between Linlithgow and Edinburgh. Mud and rocks have fallen on to the tracks at Winchburgh leading to replacement buses and cancellations to some services The operator told passengers travelling between Edinburgh and Glasgow to use trains from Glasgow Queen Street low level and Glasgow Central. Services between Edinburgh and Dunblane and Edinburgh and Stirling have also been affected. Transport Minister Humza Yousaf tweeted: 'It should be noted that safety is the main issue here. 'Simply a matter that cannot and will not be compromised on. As the picture demonstrates landslips present a very real danger to our rail services. 'Plan will be to inform people before the evening peak of service disruptions.' Heavy rain had earlier brought flooding to the line near Linlithgow, leading to disruption during the morning rush hour between Glasgow and Edinburgh. A landslip at Kirkconnel in Dumfries and Galloway also led to cancellations between to trains between Glasgow and Carlisle and services in Ayrshire but engineers cleared the debris allowing trains to run.

Georgina was announced at 2pm yesterday, warning of high winds between midnight and 5am today. It comes after the Met Office decided not to name a 95mph storm last week that downed trees and damaged buildings.

Forecasters at the time insisted the impact level of the winds was not severe enough to warrant being named as an official winter storm, because it happened at night and therefore had a lower impact on the country.

Heavy rain is also expected from the early hours of today and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has issued flood alerts in areas where thawing snow has already led to problems with lying water.

Transport Minister Humza Yousaf warned travel could be disrupted. A landslide has been reported on the A76 between Kirkconnel and Kelloholm in Dumfries and Galloway and vehicles are being diverted.

Some Caledonian MacBrayne ferry services have been cancelled due to the weather while Argyll Ferries said that due to high winds, sailings on the Gourock to Dunoon route may be liable to disruption at short notice.

Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said: 'It will be increasingly unsettled overnight with bouts of heavy rain and increasingly strong winds pushing in. Once the wettest weather moves in, (the) winds really pick up.

'Blustery showers will push through western Scotland and affect northern Scotland later (with) 60 to 70mph in exposed locations. There will be some sunshine away from the showers but it's going to be a very blustery start.'

Today's wind and rain is set to be followed by cooler conditions tomorrow and Friday, with showers in the West and temperatures of around 10C (50F) in the South East, and 6-7C (43-45F) in the North.

And the chance of widespread overnight frost is expected to return tomorrow night, when temperatures in rural areas could fall to -1C (30F) or -2C (28F) in southern England, and -3C (27F) in the North East.

In Ireland, strong winds are expected today after the country was battered by Storm Georgina last night. Despite the warning ending at 5am, blustery winds and widespread rain will continue across the country today.

Met Éireann forecaster Liz Gavin said: 'Winds will still be strong, south-westerly in direction with temperatures generally 7C-8C (45F-46F). It's a mix of sunny spells and showers overnight with lows of 2C-4C (36F-37F).'

'Thursday will be another showery day. Some showers will be wintry with a mix of hail, with temperatures of around 6C-7C (43F-45F). Winds will be more of a north-westerly direction.

'It will be cold overnight with lows of 1C-3C (34F-37F). It will be dry for a time on Friday but we will see rain approaching from the west towards late afternoon and we will see outbreaks of rain spreading across the country.'"

Most notably, police say that Smollett has thus far failed to come in for follow-up questioning despite authorities having made clear privately and publicly that they want to talk with him following the bombshell claims of two men once viewed as “potential suspects” but who are now “fully cooperating” with law enforcement in the case. Meanwhile, “rumors” are circulating among local media that authorities may be convening a Grand Jury soon.

“As rumors swirl of a Grand Jury being convened soon on what was once classified as a ‘potential hate crime’ on January 29, the Windy City cops said Sunday that they ‘cannot confirm any details as the investigation is still on-going,'” Deadline‘s Dominic Patten reported Sunday. “However, a well-placed law enforcement source tells Deadline that despite emerging and complicating evidence and requests for a further formal interview, Smollett has not made himself available ‘in a timely fashion’ to investigators.”‘

“There are a lot of questions that need to be answered, and a sense of frustration with the response by Smollett and his lawyers,” the source told Deadline.

Investigators’ call for Smollett to come back in for more questions follows a dramatic turn of events on Saturday: Police sources revealed to reporters that the former “potential suspects” — two American brothers of Nigerian descent, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, alleged associates of Smollett taken in for questioning Wednesday and released Friday — said that Smollett had paid them to orchestrate the attack.

In a statement Saturday, Smollett’s legal team issued a strong denial, casting Smollett as being “further victimized” by the new allegations. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” his lawyers said in statement to the press. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s attorneys then acknowledged that one of the men was a “personal trainer” of the actor, but suggested that it was “impossible to believe” that he claimed Smollett’s “complicity” in the attack. “One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

His lawyers concluded by insisting that he would “continue to cooperate” with authorities about the case. “Jussie and his attorney’s anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At present time, Jussie and his attorney’s have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels,” they wrote.

The statement came in response to a series of bombshell reports Saturday, including from CBS News, which reported that a “source close to the investigation” confirmed that the two brothers “told detectives Smollett paid them to participate in the alleged attack on January 29 and that they purchased the rope — which was found around Smollett’s neck — at a nearby hardware store.”

“The source said detectives have evidence to corroborate the sale, something the men’s attorney alluded to Friday night,” CBS reported.

“New evidence that was brought to their attention, obviously I had it, my clients had it,” the Osundairo brothers’ attorney Gloria Schmidt said Saturday.

The Chicago Police Department has issued an official statement appearing to confirm the reports. “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago PD said Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

The actor told police last month he was attacked in Chicago in the early hours of the morning by two masked men who shouted ""racial and homophobic slurs."" Police said Smollett described the assailants punching him in the face, pouring a chemical on him and wrapping a rope around his neck.

Police are still waiting to hear from the actor regarding a follow-up interview so they can ask him questions relating to the claim of two brothers who say they were paid by the actor to orchestrate the attack.

Here are the most recent developments in the case:

California police: Smollett posed as his brother during suspected DUI stop in 2007

Smollett's credibility came under attack again Tuesday when the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office confirmed an NBC News report that the actor posed as his brother Jake when stopped for a suspected DUI in Los Angeles in July 2007 and signed his brother's name on the summons promising to appear in court.

Frank Mateljan, a public information officer in that office, confirmed to USA TODAY Wednesday that Smollett pleaded no contest to driving under the influence, driving without a license and providing false information to law enforcement in September of that year. He was sentenced to three years' probation plus fines or three days in jail.

USA TODAY has requested comment from Smollett's representatives and his brother.

Chicago prosecutor Kim Foxx recuses herself from Smollett case

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced she was recusing herself from the investigation on Tuesday.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” Tandra Simonton, a spokeswoman for Foxx, said in a statement.

Simonton declined to comment on which potential witnesses Foxx was referencing.

FBI is looking into whether Smollett had a hand in threatening letter

The FBI is probing whether Smollett had any role in sending a threatening letter that was mailed to the actor at the Chicago studio where ""Empire"" is filmed a week before the alleged assault, a federal government official who has been briefed on the investigation told USA TODAY.

The official, who was not authorized to comment on the ongoing investigation, said the FBI probe is still in the preliminary stages.

FBI officials declined to comment.

Last week, Chicago police officer Michael Carroll confirmed to USA TODAY that the mail, received Jan. 22, contained a white substance. The powder was later determined to be acetaminophen, or Tylenol.

Smollett said in an interview with “Good Morning America” last week that he believes the letter was linked to the alleged assault on him.

He said the letter “had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing towards it with the words that said 'Smollett, Jussie you will die,' "" he said, adding that the return address area simply said ""MAGA.""

Police say a tip Smollett was seen in an elevator with alleged attackers is 'unfounded'

Police investigated a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers who were later arrested and released from custody in the probe.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Tuesday night that the tip ""is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives.""

Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together that night. .

Smollett case could go to a grand jury

Smollett’s case could be headed toward a grand jury soon, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told USA TODAY.

The official was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing deliberations.

TMZ reported Monday that the case could head to a grand jury next week. But the law enforcement official told USA TODAY that investigators have no firm date for referring the case.

“We’re still hopeful he’ll come in and talk to us,” the official said.

Brothers say Smollett paid them to carry out assault

After being arrested, a pair of Nigerian siblings in their late 20s who reside in Chicago told detectives that they were paid to stage the attack, a person familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY.

Police also found records in the Chicago home of one of the men that showed they purchased rope from a hardware store that was used in the alleged attack, the source told USA TODAY.

The brothers were released Friday with police citing new evidence in the case. They were not charged.

Police spokesman Tom Ahernsaid the brothers met with police and prosecutors Tuesday. They did not testify before a grand jury.

Smollett, 36, who is black and gay, said he was attacked while walking home through Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood. He told police masked men tied a noose around his neck and yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" before leaving the scene.

Smollett acknowledges knowing the brothers but denies involvement

In a statement issued late Saturday, the actor's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, confirmed to USA TODAY that the star knew the brothers and employed one as his trainer to get him physically ready for a music video.

Smollett was ""angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" his attorneys said in a statement.

Pugh and Henderson added, ""He has been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Detectives want to interview Smollett again

On Sunday, Guglielmi confirmed that detectives had requested a follow-up interview with the actor, tweeting, ""There are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.""

Pamela Sharp, Smollett’s spokeswoman, issued a statement to USA TODAY Monday from her client's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, who said Smollett had no plans to meet with authorities that day.

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,"" the statement read. ""Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett's attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

Fox rejects theory Smollett staged attack to avoid being written off 'Empire'

In a statement issued late Thursday, the network shot down a story by ABC7 Chicago alleging the actor was trying to garner sympathy to convince the network not to write him off the show.

""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of 'Empire' is patently ridiculous,"" the network told USA TODAY Thursday. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Backlash grows

In a lengthy interview with ""Good Morning America"" host Robin Roberts Thursday, Smollett spoke of his frustration not just with his assailants but those who have attacked him in the press and on social media, saying that they not only ""don't believe this is the truth"" but ""don't even want to see this is the truth.""

However, his doubters grew louder over the weekend following the announcement that the police are now actively investigating the hoax angle.

Former Obama strategist David Axelrod summed up the fears of many Sunday when he tweeted, ""The racist/homophobic attack @JussieSmollett alleged was horrific. But if this story turns out to be a hoax, orchestrated by Smollett to boost his career, he will have cynically betrayed supporters across the country.""

REGARDLESS OF SMOLLETT: Crimes against blacks, gays are up, according to FBI (Jan. 31)

Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. went after Smollett, whom he said ""tried to manufacture a hate crime"" to make his father's supporters look bad and the media who, ""not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story."" He also took aim at 2020 Democratic contender Sen. Kamala Harris and various ""Hollywood and media types,"" asking if they still wanted ""#JusticeforJussie.""

Director Ava DuVernay said Sunday that despite any inconsistencies in Smollett's story, she ""can't blindly believe the Chicago PD"" given its handling of Laquan McDonald's shooting death and its past use of torture.

""He might have lied. He might not have. I don’t know. But what I do know?"" the ""Wrinkle in Time"" director wrote. ""I never believe police on general principle just ‘cause they say so. My experience, our history, makes it impossible for me to do so.""

One being that high-powered Democrats plotted with the actor to push the anti-lynching bill. Others, like Tariq Nasheed, claim it is only because of Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack is being used to push the LGBT language in the anti-lynching bill.

See Also: Mike Pence Has The Unchristian Nerve To Compare Trump To Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Nasheed wrote on Twitter, “They used this Jussie hoax to pass this anti Lynching bill, and this is the first time in history the white LGBT community has an official document GIVING THEM FEDERAL PROTECTIONS AS AN OPPRESSED GROUP like Black Americans. This Lynching Bill was a victory for the LGBT crowd.” According to Nasheed, the “they” is Sen. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.

A fake Judge Joe Brown also tweeted the conspiracy theory:

Another account claimed, “The # JussieSmollettHoax was used by unscrupulous individuals like @ CoryBooker to pass a lynching law to benefit gays while ignoring police murdering Black people. This was NOT accidental. It was very deliberate.”

However, the anti-lynching legislation has been in place for months.

Civil rights attorney and SiriusXM radio host Lurie Favors wrote on her Twitter, “No. They worked on that law for months – as has been repeatedly reported. The bill was introduced in 2018. There are real reasons for concern w this case. It’s sad to see our own folks reaching this hard.”

White evangelicals complained about sexual orientation and gender identity being in the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act, claims it just covers race. However, from the start, the legislation include religion and disability, however, conservatives jumped on protecting the lives of sexual orientation and gender identity for a reason to not pass the bill.

Sadly, people like Tariq Nasheed, not realizing Black LGBT people experience violence at a higher rate than their white counterparts, pushes a conspiracy theory simply because Sen. Harris tweeted, “This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

How disturbing that people want to advocate against lives being protected simply because they are part of the LGBT community. Nasheed and other conspiracy theorist do not appear to have an issue with religion or disability being included.

The Jussie Smollett attack is still being investigated, but regardless of the outcome, the anti-lynching law stands alone from him. The bill was recently passed in the Senate and it will now go to the House.

The House speaker had tweeted the following on the day of the alleged attack.

“The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.”

But now, the tweet has been deleted from her account amid allegations that Smollett, who claimed he was attacked at around 2 a.m. near a subway in Chicago by two ski mask-clad men, faked the brutal attack in order to save his job.

The TV star told police details of the assault, claiming the two men shouted racist and homophobic abuse at him and tied a rope noose around his neck and poured a bleach-like substance on him. He said that the insults used included “this is MAGA country,” “Empire f****t” and “Empire n*****,” according to the Daily Mail. But late last week, new rumors emerged, stating that the openly-gay actor allegedly paid two Nigerian brothers that he met on the set of Empire to help him orchestrate the attack so he could “save his job.”

Investigators now believe that he paid the two men, who had previously worked as extras on the show and were identified as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, a whopping $3,500 to assault him. One of the brothers has also been confirmed as Smollett’s personal trainer.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” said Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. He added that the police reached out to Smollett’s legal team for a follow-up interview. The actor’s lawyers released a statement denying the claims.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.”

They added the Hollywood star had been “further victimized” by the new allegations that he planned his own attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” they said.

Before the rumors arose, a wave of support from several celebrities and politicians poured through social media, including from Nancy Pelosi, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, and New Jersey Democratic Senator Corey Booker."

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said police had reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request a follow-up interview with him.

Pam Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett reported last month that he was attacked by men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault. They also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police."

Why would a hot young actor in a hit series create a scandal that keeps unraveling and looking worse and worse?

Maybe one answer can be found in the ratings for “Empire.” Once a show that everyone watched and talked about, “Empire” is starting to fade, and fast.

When the show returns on March 13th, “Empire” will be down over 10% in total viewers from its previous season and 16% in the key demo of 18-49.

The last season, which started in September, returned with just 6 million viewers. The second week saw a decline of 1 million. On November 14th, the number dropped below 5 million to 4.8 million. The show finished on December 5th with just over 5 million total, and a weak 1.50 in the demo.

Was Smollett worried about the ratings? His so-called mugging was the most publicity “Empire” has had in eons. Whether Smollett’s story turns out to be true or not, it will definitely have an impact on the March 13th return. It could be this was some kind of misguided effort to get attention.

It’s not “Empire” would be cancelled. Even with 5 million viewers, the show remains a hit for Fox. But a 7th season ending doesn’t seem out of the question. The thrills of “Empire”– a show that burns through plot faster than Donald Trump on Adderall– are less a novelty than ever before. The ratings are slowly draining. After this new, sixth season the odds are it will be time to say goodbye– even if a comeback is plotted a few years down the line.

If “Empire” ended, the main stars Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson could book new TV roles or pursue their movie careers. Taraji is starring right now in “What Men Want.” But Smollett and the other young people would be at the same crossroads as other TV actors coming off hits. Nothing is guaranteed."

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett attack was a hoax and that he paid the brothers to orchestrate the attack or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in their statement.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett’s account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

The likely reason? New reports over the weekend indicate that Chicago detectives investigating the Smollett incident have evidence suggesting he orchestrated a hoax attack for unknown reasons.

What are the details?



Before any facts were known in the Smollett assault — which allegedly occurred early in the morning on Jan. 29 — Pelosi expressly condemned what Smollett claimed happened, denouncing the ""racist, homophobic attack"" as ""an affront to our humanity.""

""The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all,"" Pelosi tweeted on the evening of Jan. 29.

By Sunday, that tweet was deleted.

According to Politwoops — a ProPublica project that tracks deleted tweets from members of Congress — the tweet was removed from Pelosi's official account sometime Sunday evening.



Pelosi has not issued a statement about the Smollett case's most recent developments.

Meanwhile, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, said over the weekend he would withhold comment about the developments until ""until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources."" That was after he condemned the alleged attack as ""modern-day lynching"" on the same day Smollett claimed it occurred.

What happened with the case over the weekend?

Several significant developments surfaced over the weekend. The case took a dramatic turn Friday night after the two men police apprehended for the alleged assault — Nigerian brothers Olabinjo Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola Osundairo, 25 — were released from custody without charges.

A spokesman for the Chicago Police Department said new evidence, which surfaced while interrogating the Osundairo brothers, prompted their release.

On Saturday, reports indicated that evidence included proof Smollett colluded with the Osundairo brothers to orchestrate the fake attack, including paying the brothers $4,000 each. Police have not yet definitively confirmed the attack was a hoax, but law enforcement sources in Chicago continue to tell members of the media the investigation is leading detectives to such a conclusion.

In a statement over the weekend, Smollett's attorneys said the actor is ""angered and devastated"" by reports alleging he faked the attack."

Military spokesman Arye Shalicar told AFP the way the man was dressed 'allowed him to approach the soldier' in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, the army said.

Photos showed the man wearing a black T-shirt with the word 'press' emblazoned on it.

Elsewhere today, two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli military in the Gaza Strip.

The Gaza clashes occurred during what Palestinians called a 'Friday of revolution' against Israel and saw 98 others wounded or injured.

It comes amid escalating tensions between Palestinians and Israelis this month.

Last night, Palestinians torched the Jewish holy site of Joseph's Tomb.

Rioters set fire to the site revered by Jews in the West Bank city of Nablus, just hours after Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu called on the Palestinian leadership to resist from such attacks.

It was condemned by the Israeli army as a 'despicable act', while Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas insisted the site would be repaired.

Palestinians overran Joseph's Tomb overnight, attacking it with petrol bombs.

Palestinian police dispersed the crowd and firefighters extinguished the blaze before Israeli security forces arrived.

This is not the first time the tomb has come under attack. Palestinians tried to set fire to it again last year and virtually destroyed the site in 2000 after Israeli guards withdrew amid clashes.

Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas criticised the fire at the religious site in the northern city of Nablus.

He had not explicitly condemned any of the recent attacks until this one on Joseph's Tomb.

He said the 'illegal' arson 'offends our culture and our religion and our morals' and said a committee would investigate and the damage would be repaired.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday reiterated his willingness to meet Mr Abbas, while accusing him of inciting and encouraging violence.

'It's time that president Abbas stops not only justifying it, but also calling for it,' Mr Netanyahu told reporters.

JOSEPH'S TOMB...REVERED BY JEWS AND MUSLIMS Joseph's Tomb, inside a compound in the Palestinian refugee camp of Balata in Nablus, has been the scene of recurring violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Many Jews believe it to be the final resting place of the biblical Joseph, while Muslims believe that an Islamic cleric, Sheikh Yussef (Joseph) Dawiqat was buried there two centuries ago. It was ransacked and burnt by Palestinian rioters at start of second uprising in October, 2000. The shrine is under Palestinian control and off-limits to Israelis except on escorted trips organised by the army. Advertisement

But the latest round of violence shows no sign of abating, with Palestinians calling for a 'Friday of revolution' against Israel.

Last week, a 20-year-old from the West Bank city of Hebron was shot dead in front of TV cameras after allegedly trying to stab a security guard near Damascus Gate.

Later in the evening, heavily-armed police stormed a supermarket in downtown Jerusalem after an elderly woman was stabbed outside a bus station.

Earlier attacks included a man driving his car into a bus stop of Israelis before hacking one of them to death.

Israeli security forces have been deployed in increasing numbers in the past fortnight.

The violence began on October 1, when a suspected cell of the Islamist movement Hamas murdered a Jewish settler couple in the West Bank in front of their children.

Eight Israelis have been killed in a wave of knife attacks and 31 Palestinians have died this month.

Beginning on Sunday, some 300 soldiers will reinforce the police, stretched by the unrest.

The last time soldiers were deployed in such large numbers was in 2002, during the second Palestinian uprising.

The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the upsurge of violence."

Palestinians clashed with Israeli riot police after barricading themselves inside a mosque at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, throwing firebombs and rocks at officers outside during a major Jewish holiday.

The hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City is a frequent flashpoint and its fate is a core issue at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

It is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, site of the two biblical Jewish temples. Muslims revere it as the Noble Sanctuary, where they believe the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven there.

Police said young protesters barricaded themselves inside the Al-Aqsa mosque despite an order permitting only men over the age of 50 from entering the compound for prayers.

Israel has imposed the ban at times of unrest in the past as it is mostly young Palestinians who throw rocks at the holy site. Women of all ages are allowed to enter.

Palestinians stockpiled rocks and other projectiles at the Al-Aqsa mosque overnight, according to police spokeswoman Luba Samri.

Police tried to negotiate with the Waqf – the Islamic religious authority that oversees the compound – to call for calm, but talks failed and police entered the compound to seize the 'dangerous devices intended to harm visitors to the site and police and endanger their lives,' she said.

Palestinians threw rocks, firebombs and firecrackers from within the mosque at the police, Samri also said, adding that the firebombs sparked a fire at the entrance to the mosque.

Waqf guards did not prevent the 'desecration of the sanctity of the place,' she said.

Officers later managed to restore calm, but sporadic Palestinian stone-throwing persisted throughout the morning. By noon, the site was quiet, police said.

The director of Al-Aqsa Mosque, Omar Kiswani, blamed Israeli police for the violence.

'We asked the police yesterday not to allow any non-Muslim in the compound in these tense days, but police didn't respond positively to our demands,' he said, adding that several people had suffered from tear gas inhalation.

The Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammed Hussein, condemned Israel's actions against the protesters saying it will have 'serious consequences.'

'Israel is trying to divide the mosque between us and Jews, the mosque is ours. It's an Islamic holy site and we will not let them do that,' he said.

Jerusalem police chief Moshe Edri vowed to bring violent protesters to justice. 'It is inconceivable that a group of rioters desecrate a holy place and endanger lives,' he said.

It was the second day in a row of violence at the site.

Monday's unrest occurred on the first day of Sukkot, a week-long festival that celebrates the fall harvest and commemorates the wandering of the ancient Israelites through the desert following the exodus from Egypt.

Israeli police officers detain a Palestinian man during clashes with Palestinians in Jerusalem's Old City. Monday's unrest occurred on the first day of Sukkot, a week-long festival that celebrates the fall harvest and commemorates the wandering of the ancient Israelites through the desert following the exodus from Egypt

In ancient times, Jews made pilgrimages to Jerusalem on Sukkot and many Jews are expected to visit the city throughout the holiday period.

Rumours have swirled among Palestinians that Jews are planning to take over the holy site, which has fuelled tensions.

Those rumours were exacerbated earlier this month by calls from a group of religious Jews to visit the site on the eve of the Jewish New Year.

Palestinians say that in the last two months, there has been a new development where Israel has intermittently restricted some Muslims from the compound when Jews visit.

Israel says this is to reduce friction, but Palestinians claim that Israel intends to establish Muslim-free Jewish visiting hours, which they fear could upset the fragile arrangement in place.

The site is so sensitive that even rumours are enough to trigger violence.

Israel has promised to ensure the status quo at the site and insists it will not allow the delicate status quo governing the site to be changed.

But its actions in quelling the violence have drawn criticism from Arab countries, including Jordan, which has a peace treaty with Israel and administers Muslim religious affairs at the site.

Israel has blamed Palestinian leaders for inciting the unrest.

Non-Muslim visitors are only allowed to enter the site at specific hours and are banned by police from praying there. However many Muslims view these visits as a provocation.

The hilltop compound is so holy for Jews that they traditionally have refrained from praying there, congregating instead at the adjacent Western Wall.

Israel's chief rabbis, as well as the rabbi of the Western Wall, have issued directives urging people not to ascend the Temple Mount – arguing that Jews could inadvertently enter the holiest area of the once-standing temple, where it was forbidden to tread.

But there is a movement advocating the rights for Jews to pray at the hilltop. Some try and get around the ban on prayers by secretly mumbling the words.

Police said 24 Jews and 450 tourists visited the site Monday morning.

The Temple Mount and Land of Israel Faithful Movement, a small group that seeks the construction of a new Jewish temple on the site, has called for a march to the compound on Wednesday. Israeli police have promised to prevent them from getting close to the site.

About two weeks ago, there were several days of clashes as Muslim protesters barricaded themselves inside the mosque while hurling stones and fireworks at police.

The unrest spread to Arab neighborhoods of east Jerusalem, where Palestinian protesters hurled stones at police and Israeli cars.

An Israeli died when Palestinians pelted his car with rocks and several others were injured in other incidents.

The attacks, plus another two stabbing attacks in the central Israeli city of Raanana, north of Tel Aviv, mark the most serious series of incidents in a month-long wave of violence.

A police spokesman said a Palestinian stabbed and wounded an Israeli man waiting at a bus stop on the main thoroughfare of Raanana today.

The Israeli was moderately wounded and amateur video distributed by police showed several men kicking and beating the alleged assailant as he lay on the ground. The ambulance service said he was seriously hurt.

A shopkeeper said that, after hearing shouting, he had grabbed a heavy wooden umbrella and ran outside to confront the assailant.

'He started stabbing the guy. I hit him a couple of times and kicked him and the knife flew out of his hand,' the store owner said. 'I wish I had had a gun - I would have shot him.'

Within an hour of that attack, another knife-wielding Palestinian struck in Raanana, wounding four people, police and media reports said.

The main Palestinian factions, including the Western-backed Fatah movement and the militant Hamas group, declared a 'Day of Rage' today across the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.

The leaders of Israel's Arab community have called for a commercial strike in their towns and villages.

Police closed major highways leading in and out of Jerusalem, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called an emergency meeting of his Security Cabinet, where police were to present a plan to halt the violence.

Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said the country's internal security minister, Gilad Erdan, was considering a number of immediate steps, including a closure on Arab neighborhoods in east Jerusalem, where many of the attackers have come from, and making it easier to get gun licenses.

Since the Jewish New Year last month, five Israelis have been killed and dozens wounded in a shooting, a stoning and a series of stabbings.

At least 26 Palestinians been killed by Israeli fire, including 10 identified by Israel as attackers and the rest in clashes between stone-throwers and Israeli troops. Hundreds of Palestinians have been wounded in such confrontations.

Yesterday, Palestinians carried out three stabbings in Jerusalem, leaving a teenage Israeli boy in critical condition.

The unrest began last month with clashes at Al-Aqsa Mosque - Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site - and quickly spread across Israel and into the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

The Israeli military have today said hundreds of Palestinian protesters in Gaza had gathered near the Israeli border and are throwing stones and burning tires toward Israeli positions.

The army says it is using 'riot dispersal means' against the crowd. Palestinian medics say five people have been wounded by Israeli gunfire, two of them seriously.

Over the weekend, nine Palestinians in Gaza, including a mother and her two-year-old child, were killed in Israeli-Palestinian violence.

The stabbings have rattled Israel. The attackers, many of them teenagers, have had no affiliation with militant groups, and the seemingly random nature of the stabbings has made it difficult to predict or prevent them.

Netanyahu has come under heavy criticism for failing to stop the violence, and an opinion poll this week showed that more than 70 per cent of the public is dissatisfied with his handling of the crisis.

Some of the attacks have been carried out by members of Israel's Arab minority.

In a fiery speech to parliament, Netanyahu accused the country's Arab leaders of helping incite weeks of violence, accusing Arab parties of 'undermining' the country and calling on Israel's Arab citizens to 'kick out the extremists among you'.

Two people were killed in the bus attack. Media reports said one of the assailants used a gun and the other a knife.

In the ruined streets of Gaza, children play among piles of broken concrete and twisted steel, while their parents live out of tents erected between the walls of their destroyed homes, pockmarked by the shrapnel from exploding shells.

It has been almost a year since the outbreak of an eight week war in the Gaza strip, which saw 2,132 Palestinians and 71 Israelis killed, 10,000 homes destroyed and 17,500 families left homeless.

It was hoped that $3.5billion of aid pledged by world leaders would help its citizens put their shattered lives back together, but infighting between Palestinian groups and a ceasefire that has never really taken hold has meant they money has been slow in coming, and rebuilding has not yet begun.

Broken-hearted: Political graffiti adorns the wall of a ruined house in Gaza, where rebuilding has yet to begin despite nearly a year having passed since the outbreak of an eight-week war that some the homes destroyed by airstrikes

Flattened: The war saw more than 2,000 people killed, 10,000 homes destroyed, and 17,500 families left without a home, and a year on the situation has improved very little

Tribute: Among the devastation graffiti artists have moved in to leave their mark, including the word-renowned Banksy, with residents even putting up shelters to protect his art (pictured)

Left to rot: In the wake of last year's war, world leaders promised $3.5billion in aid, but nearly 12 months later just a quarter has been released

Abandoned: According to aid agencies in the region, no concerted rebuilding effort has started yet, with tens of thousands living in temporary shelters after their homes were flattened

Frustrated: Support for Hamas, the armed group which controls Gaza, has fallen sharply since the conflict in which around 1,500 civilians were killed, largely in airstrikes by the Israeli airforce

According to aid agencies, just $900million of the aid that was promised in October last year had been delivered by April this year, with some countries - such as close neighbours Kuwait, Turkey and UEA - giving nothing at all.

These images show the desperate existence of some of Gaza's poorest residents who had everything taken from them during last year's conflict.

Graffiti artists have since moved in to adorn the rubble with spray-paint, creating sketches of animals on abandoned buildings, or using the slabs of concrete left behind to make a political point.

Famed street artist Banksy has added several murals to the city, including a image of Greek goddess Niobe weeping, which was spray-painted on the door of a house, the only part of the building still standing.

That has now been seized by authorities amid an ownership dispute, but others - such as a large mural of a cat - remain standing, and have even been fenced off to protect them from being stolen.

Nothing left: Some of Gaza's poorest families lost everything during the conflict, and since then have struggled to rebuild their lives

Struggle: With aid money scarce, infighting between the factions controlling Gaza, and deaths continuing despite an official ceasefire, life only gets tougher for Gaza's citizens

On the brink: Mounds of rubble and destroyed buildings scar the landscape of Gaza, as its people continue with life as best they can

Broken: Despite many of the buildings in Gaza being reduced to mere shells, there is still evidence of people living among the ruins, such as the rugs hanging from brick walls (left)

Mangled: Despite the buildings here being completely bombed out, families still live amongst the ruins as they have nowhere else to go

Crippled: An entire row of buildings reduced to rubble following the eight week war in Gaza last year in which more than 1,400 civilians died

Home sweet home: This is what many families have been reduced to living in, even 12 months after the Israel and Gaza conflict ended, as rebuilding efforts have largely filed to get underway

Israel was heavily criticised over the high number of civilian casualties during the war, with Israel's leaders attacking Hamas for hiding its stores of missiles and launchers in civilian neighbourhoods.

Since the end of the war support for Hamas has fallen, according to a poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, which shows that half of Gaza residents want to emigrate, compared to 25 percent in the West Bank.

A majority, 63 percent, expressed dissatisfaction with 'achievements compared to human and material losses' in the 2014 Gaza war. Fighting devastated parts of Gaza and reconstruction has been slow, causing many there to ask if it was worth it.

The center's director, Khalil Shikaki, said the 50 per cent immigration figure in Gaza is higher than ever before and that among young people it is even higher, about 80 percent.

Makingthe best of it: Young, bare footed, Palestinian boys break concrete with a sledgehammer so the cement and steel from bombed buildings can be recycled and the family income supplemented

What remains: This woman is still living among the ruins of her bombed-out home in the village of Khuza'a, in the southern Gaza strip

Close quarters: A family live among the ruins of their old home in Gaza following the eight-week conflict with Israel last summer

'Gaza is definitely showing tremendous frustration,' Shikaki said.

Of those polled, 63 percent said they support launching rockets at Israel while a blockade is in place. The same number said they favor indirect talks between Hamas and Israel to negotiate a long-term truce in exchange for lifting the blockade.

Israel and Egypt imposed the blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized the coastal territory from forces loyal to Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007, arguing it prevents Hamas from getting more weapons.

Elsewhere, Palestinian officials say they are pressing ahead with their war crimes case against Israel in the International Criminal Court.

Just a shell: While many Gaza residents dream of getting their former lives back, a lack of international aid, the continuing blockade of the strip, and infighting between armed Palestinian groups has held efforts back

Foreign Minister Riad Malki said Thursday that he will travel to the Hague on June 25 to present the Palestinians' first reports to the court as part of a preliminary investigation.

He said the reports will focus on Israeli settlement construction and Israel's war in the Gaza Strip last year. The Palestinians joined the ICC this year.

The Haaretz daily said Thursday that an ICC delegation would soon be visiting as part of the investigation. It quoted a senior Israeli official as dismissing the visit as a routine procedure. Israel opposes the investigation, accusing the Palestinians of avoiding negotiations.

It was billed as a simple family country wedding – but Pippa Middleton’s nuptials were anything but.

The extravagant celebrations are estimated to have cost more than £1 million, although thanks to some generous friends her family didn’t have to foot the full bill.

The day started with a champagne breakfast and ended with whisky sorbet and chasers – plus a game of table tennis between seven-times Wimbledon champion Roger Federer and Princes William and Harry.

Like all good weddings there was something old, something new, something borrowed and something (very) blue.

The old was a romantic movie-style collage of photographs of Pippa and James Matthews over the years which, bizarrely, was projected 100ft-wide on to her £6million family home for two hours during their wedding reception on Saturday night.

For the new, there was Pippa’s £40,000 Giles Deacon wedding dress and a stunning Robinson Pelham pearl tiara. Her something borrowed was the Spitfire that soared over the Berkshire countryside for free – and the fleet of 50 new Range Rovers lent to the Middletons by the company to ferry their guests around. As for blue, there was no contest: the best man’s speech given by an old friend of James, Justin Johannsen.

The day started early for residents of Englefield, the small Berkshire village next to the private estate where the ceremony was held.

They queued up to catch a glimpse of Pippa and her group of eight bridesmaids and pageboys, including, of course, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, her niece and nephew.

Pippa, 33, who enjoyed a scrambled eggs breakfast with her mother and closest friends, was described by one guest as being ‘serene’ and unfazed by the eyes of the world upon her.

Sources said George, three, fell over outside the church, prompting a brief bottom lip wibble, and Charlotte, in her pretty £448 Pepa & Co dress, made several breaks for freedom.

Back at Englefield House, a relaxed wedding breakfast was held with more than 20 types of canapes courtesy of leading society caterer Table Talk, including mini haggis (a homage to James’s Scottish leanings), muntjac carpaccio with mushroom, fresh langoustine claws and asparagus spears with hollandaise sauce – using as many British ingredients as possible.

Table Talk’s brief was to create a relaxed, modern feel, with guests given the chance to munch as they mingled while a table was set up manned by chefs slicing huge legs of serrano ham. There was also a Parmesan wheel, foie gras with little toasts and sauternes jelly.

Pippa’s father Michael gave a short but charming speech at the lunch, where he joked he’d now lost both of his daughters – but to great men. A source said: ‘He couldn’t have made it clearer how proud he was of Pippa.’

Afterwards a ‘standard three-tier cake, plain but pretty’ by royal baker Fiona Cairns was cut. All the while a jazz trio played, although one source admitted they ‘weren’t very good and didn’t go down that well’.

Others described bridesmaid Princess Charlotte as being ‘a bit fidgety’ with Kate having to hold her still.

While the wedding breakfast may have been low-key, no expense was spared for the black-tie evening reception at Michael and Carole Middleton’s home, from the £100,000 glass marquee downwards.

Guests began to arrive from 7pm at Bucklebury village hall. Each had to provide a passport photo and password beforehand, and even tennis legends Federer and Tim Henman had to go through the vetting process.

Just before 8pm the Spitfire looped in the skies before guests went in to feast on a five-course dinner including smoked salmon, Scottish lamb, and a whisky sorbet. Ice creams were handed around at the end.

It was all washed down with 750 bottles of Nyetimber 2010 Blanc de Noir Millington, costing £56,250.

The groom and his brother Spencer had given short speeches earlier, but the best man’s speech was kept back until 11.30pm.

Prince Harry had eyes only for girlfriend Meghan Markle, but was persuaded by Federer to play him on one of the table tennis tables dotted about in homage to one of Pippa’s favourite sports. Federer played Pippa, Kate and William too, and at one point the princes took him on together.

Meanwhile, James and Spencer took to the dance floor and threw some ‘weird’ moves – as the party raged on until 4am."

The Blast reached out to Chicago police Monday morning to inquire whether the ""Empire"" actor was considered a victim, suspect or person of interest in the investigation.

Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi could not provide a direct answer, saying, ""We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with the Empire cast member before we can answer this question.""

Officials have reached out to Smollett's attorney and requested additional time to interview him, and it's now apparent they want to use the information provided from the Nigerian brothers.

Ola and Abel Usondairos reportedly told police Smollett paid them to participate in a staged attack, and even instructed them to buy the rope that was tied around his neck.

The brothers, who took off to Nigeria the day after the attack and were arrested when they came home, have been released with no charges and are cooperating with police.

Smollett's attorney released a scathing statement over the weekend, claiming the star is devastated over the reports, and that he has ""been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.""

As we reported, days after the attack, Smollett played to a sold-out crowd at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, and fought back tears while telling the audience, ""I couldn’t let those motherf**kers win.""

After more evidence appears to suggest Smollett orchestrated his own attack, stars and politicians have started to publicly change their tune and erase tracks of support."

In light of the recent developments in the investigation into last month's attack on Jussie Smollett, celebrities are speaking out.

Chicago police were pursuing ""additional detective work"" Sunday amid suspicion that a Jan. 29 attack on actor/singer Jussie Smollett may have been faked. Two brothers told investigators they were paid by the ""Empire"" actor to stage the attack, according to a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly.

Smollett’s attorneys issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police but felt ""victimized"" by reports that he might have been involved in staging an attack.

A Twitter account for ""Empire"" executive producer Brett Mahoney reinforced his belief in Smollett's account Sunday night.

""I believe and stand by @JussieSmollett,"" the account for Mahoney tweeted. ""Keep your head up.""

The official Twitter account for the FOX series' writers retweeted the post.

Mahoney previously condemned Smollett's attackers in comments to USA TODAY.

“The attack on Jussie, because he is such a beloved member of our family, hurt us all very hard. Jussie is a proud, gay black man,"" he said. ""I don’t know whether the cowards who attacked him were trying to beat the gay, the black or the pride out of him, but that’s impossible, because he’s strong. And so we’re happy that he is back at work.""

Director Ava DuVernay took to Twitter to express her doubts about Chicago police.

""Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD,"" she wrote, mentioning the department's past use of torture and the death of Laquan McDonald. ""I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.""

Later, the ""Wrinkle in Time"" director responded to questions from a Twitter user who believes ""this case was fishy from the start.""

""Yessir. I hear you. And agree,"" she replied. ""I wrote (that there) are inconsistencies. He might have lied. He might be not have. I don’t know. But what I do know? I never believe police on general principle just ‘cause they say so. My experience, our history, makes it impossible for me to do so.""

Elsewhere on Twitter, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has seemingly walked back her support of Smollett. Her Jan. 30 tweet in which she called the attack ""an affront to our humanity"" appears to have been deleted.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) who previously described the attack as ""an attempted modern-day lynching"" told reporters Sunday that he planned to withhold comment ""until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.""

Activist and MSNBC commentator the Rev. Al Sharpton said on his program, ""Politics Nation,"" Smollett should be held accountable if he is behind the attack.

""I among many others, when hearing of the reports, said that the reports were horrific and we should come with all that we can come with in order for us to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,"" Sharpton told viewers. ""I still maintain that. And, if it is found that Smollett and the gentlemen did, in some way, perpetrate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.""

According to TMZ, Jussie Smollett’s case will go before a grand jury early next week.

Law enforcement sources informed TMZ that a panel will hear the case, however it’s unclear as to who is facing charges or what those charges might entail.

On Sunday, Anthony Guglielmi, the Chief Communications Officer for the Chicago PD, took to Twitter to release a official statement:

“While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,” he wrote.

On Jan. 29, the Empire star told Chicago police he was assaulted by two men spewing racist and homophobic slurs at him. But his story has since been called into question as more and more details surrounding the alleged assault have surfaced.

It’s all been a bit confusing to follow, so here’s a timeline of events thus far, courtesy of the New York Times.

According to the 36-year-old’s lawyers, Smollett has every intention “continue to cooperate” with the investigation.

""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he said. Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was attacked while walking home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago late last month.

Smollett's lawyers said on Saturday that the actor felt ""victimised"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding: ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying"". Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question. CCTV taken in the early hours of January 29 showed the two people of interest that were interviewed by police and later released. Credit:Chicago Police Department On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment. Then, late on Friday evening, they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement. Loading ""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the attorneys said. Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments. Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a February 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to ABC News that aired on Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked. ""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive."" Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed. Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on Empire, Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show. Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

The outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the ""Empire"" star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it's all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!""— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump's election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett's own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had ""shifted"" — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police ""are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released.""

Smollett's attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to co-operate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D'Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

""And Libs wonder why we don't believe their BS stories,"" Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push ""the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.""

The response from Smollett's celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn't know what to say, but that the situation is a ""mess"" and a ""travesty.""

""I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,"" Gay wrote. ""The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.""

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a ""modern-day lynching."" On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment ""until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources."""

Al Sharpton believes Jussie Smollett should face “accountability to the maximum” — if it’s found that he made up the hate attack against him.

The outspoken civil rights leader addressed recent reports that the alleged assault on the black, openly gay “Empire” actor may have been staged with two bodybuilding brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo.

“I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,” Sharpton said Sunday night on his show “PoliticsNation” on MSNBC.

“I still maintain that,” he continued. “And if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.”

When news of the Jan. 29 attack against Smollett broke, Sharpton immediately spoke out to say he was “outraged.”

“For Jussie, who’s not only a superb actor and singer but an activist who has fought against homophobia and racism and sexism, to be a victim is something that is totally unacceptable,” he told TMZ last month. “I challenge the Chicago law enforcement to do all within their power to find out those that are guilty and they should face the maximum penalty of law.”

Sharpton is no stranger to racially charged hoax cases. In the late 1980s, the then-firebrand local political activist served as the spokesman for Tawana Brawley, a black 15-year-old who claimed she had been raped by six white men upstate. They scrawled racial epithets on her chest and smeared feces in her hair, she alleged.

The stunning case eventually went before a grand jury — which ruled after seven months that Brawley’s story was a total fabrication.

Chicago police said this weekend that their interviews of the Osundairo brothers — who were arrested on Wednesday but released two days later without charges — “shifted the trajectory” of their ongoing investigation.

The latest twist in the case comes as reports emerged that Smollett paid the budding actor-models $3,500 to stage the 2 a.m. attack.

Smollett has maintained that two strangers shouted racist and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” before dousing him in a “chemical substance,” likely bleach, and throwing a noose around his neck."

If you think looking after two or three kids is stressful enough, spare a thought for these over-worked parents.

Two Canada geese acted as day-care workers as they took an incredible army of 51 goslings for a dip in a lake in Leduc, Canada.

The adorable baby geese were seen huddled together with their nanny to follow her across the lake as a father goose kept watch.

The caring bird and her mate took over parental duties for first-time parents, giving the young chicks a better chance of survival.

'I have photographed a lot of birds and geese and I have seen 15 to 20 goslings maybe, but not this many - it was quite the sight.'

'The local wildlife expert said that this pair are much older that a lot of the other geese. They will take them under their care from first time parents for a better chance of survival.'

He said the operation is almost like 'gosling day care', where other geese will leave them with experienced parents, while they go off and 'do geese things'.

Ola and Abel Osundairo, one of which worked as an extra on the hit FOX music drama series Empire, are reportedly staying in downtown Chicago as the case pushes forward. Investigators want to be sure they have no contact with Smollett.

According to published reports, police suspect the singer/actor paid the brothers to orchestrate an assault on him late last month. But Smollett’s attorneys refute the allegations.

The Osundairobrothers were released without charges on Friday after investigators discovered “new evidence” that shifted the “trajectory of the investigation,”BBC.com reports.

As the investigation rolls on, sources connected to the case are spilling the tea to TMZ, such as details on the raid of the brothers’ home and the discovery of magazines with missing pages. Investigators are now trying to determine if they are connected to the threatening letter that Smollett received in the week before the alleged attack. Law officials also believe the brothers purchased the rope that was around his neck after the incident.

When the Empire star was notified that the brothers were in custody and considered suspects, he reportedly declined to sign complaints against them. Police officials found it suspicious that the area where Smollett said he was attacked happened near an obscure camera, which was pointed away from the scene of the crime. Cops also thought it strange that he knew the location of this particular camera.

Investigators also don’t believe the attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country,” because, “Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire.'”

Smollett’s legal team vehemently deny he had any role in the assault he alleges was carried out by two white males.

“Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” a statement from lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The attorneys also notes that it is “impossible to believe” that one of the brothers could be involved with this attack as he is Smollett’s personal trainer.

“At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels,” the statement read.

In an interview last week with Good Morning America that aired Thursday, Smollett expressed frustration about not being believed.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

He also denied reports that said he told police the attackers wore “Make America Great Again” hats.

“I never said that,” he told ABC’s Robin Roberts. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

Meanwhile many agree with attorney Scott Hechinger,who made note about the credibility of the Chicago police, “No idea what actually happend w/ Jussie Smollett. But do know that 4 years ago, Chicago PD spent 13 months justifying Laquan McDonald’s murder before releasing dashcam video showing he was walking away before being shot at 16x by an officer. Why are we just accepting their word?”

About three weeks ago, Empire Star Jussie Smollett was hospitalised after a homophobic attack. The investigation has been going on to bring his attackers to book, however, the latest development is a charge on Jussie.

According to a report from CNN, Jussie staged the whole attacked himself and rehearsed with the attackers by paying them $3,500 before and $500 after. The supposed attackers who are Nigerians were arrested and questioned but later released when this ‘new evidence’ popped up.

Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said:

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.

Smollet has denied ever having anything to do with the attack with his lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, releasing a statement.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” it added

If the media is anything to go by, a good immigrant is someone who works hard, integrates into society, behaves themselves, becomes an athlete or a film star or saves a life—someone who must prove their worth to their new country.

In a new book The Good Immigrant: 26 Writers Reflect on America, a wide-ranging group of writers, from comedians to journalists to poets, explore what being an immigrant, or the child of an immigrant, in the U.S. means in 2019. We speak to co-editors, Nikesh Shukla, who also edited the U.K. version (published in 2016), and Chimene Suleyman, poet and columnist, about putting the book together, the need for new immigrant narratives, and the politics of being an artist.

Why were you inspired to make the U.K. edition of The Good Immigrant?

Nikesh Shukla: I was increasingly irritated by the lack of British writers of color being published in the U.K. and felt like I wanted to do something more positive than just whine on Twitter all the time. At the same time, having read Claudia Rankine's exceptional Citizen, and Ta-Nehisi Coates' Between the World and Me, I wanted to read a contemporary book about race and immigration in the U.K. I figured that doing an anthology could satisfy both those itches and also be a platform for writers who the British readership deserved to hear from more.

We crowdfunded the book with Unbound, so I could prove to the publishing industry that people did want to read books by British writers of color, and we were at 104 percent before a word of the book was even written. I didn't anticipate all this would happen in tandem with Brexit and the increasingly toxic national conversation around immigration, so we inadvertently caught a mood.

What does the title, The Good Immigrant, mean?

Chimene Suleyman: The default for immigrants ends up with us having to prove our worth. The media, the government, our neighbors start out being suspicious of us until we win an Olympic sport or a reality TV show or scale a wall to save a small child dangling from a balcony. We have to pull out the superpowers first, or work as a doctor, or chef—always serving and providing—to be good. We wanted to unravel that. To think about how complex, and even contradictory, the immigrant experience is. You shouldn't have to jump through hoops to have a right to be home.

Why did you decide that a U.S. edition of the book was needed?

NS: I'm answering this question the day after Jussie Smollett was the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime and a Bollywood actor used a racist word to describe a Black soccer player. Racism has become normalized. We are seeing, every day, instances of casual and violent racism and everything in between. People feel emboldened, in America and the U.K., because of who runs our countries, how the press cover them, their dog-whistles and the fires they're stoking. America needs this book because young people of color need to have mirrors held up for them, too. So they can feel less isolated and alone and come together to resist this miserable oppression we are in.

How did you approach the contributors?

CS: It was essentially a wish list of favorite writers, comedians, musicians, filmmakers, artists. We sat down one evening and just wrote this really long list of people whose thoughts and experiences on immigration we just really wanted to know about, and we went from there. We felt it was really important to give the contributors a word count and not much else. We wanted to hear whatever they had to say about immigration, and we didn't doubt for a second that they would all have something so beautiful, and often heartbreaking, to say.

Did you notice any major thematic differences between the U.K. and U.S. editions?

CS: There was definitely a greater sense of fear, or something close to fear, in the U.S. edition. It felt more raw and urgent when expressing its frustrations. But I do wonder if the U.K. edition would have felt the same had it been written after Brexit and not just moments before it. But there are definitely more similarities than not. There is still a recurring feeling of not quite fitting in anywhere, of straddling two or three or more identities at once, of anger at both the causes of migration and then the reactions to it. Ultimately, they are both two very stunning collections that are both specific and universal at once.

One of the essays in the book, ""How to Write Iranian-America, or The Last Essay,"" Porochista Khakpour describes feeling like a token writer and being asked to draw on her experiences in a way that straight, white, male writers usually aren't. Where you concerned that The Good Immigrant would be seen as a token ""immigrant book""?

NS: Yes. Which is why I'm clear on who the book is for. Also, the book, in the U.K., was intended to be about race and immigration issues, written by people of color. And that was specifically to address a lack of these voices in publishing. However, as the book became a political tool that added its voices to a national conversation, I wondered what the book would have looked like if I'd thought about the word ""immigrant"" and included immigrant voices that weren't necessarily ones of color. And so when we were putting together the American book, we wanted to look at immigrant voices in the widest sense possible. So yes while I do have this fear, I think it is so much more than an immigrant book. And I want to exist in a world where writers of color and immigrant voices get to write about more than just their oppression. I guess, given the climate we're in, it's urgent we do address these issues.

The book's essays vary enormously in form and content. Do you think immigrant narratives are often lumped together or one specific immigrant narrative is pushed by the media?

CS: Absolutely. We are good or bad, and anything in between is erased. We are rapists, drug dealers, or terrorists, or, suddenly, when it suits everyone, we are world renowned sportsmen, celebrities, or extreme examples of altruism. You see this on a more low-key level when people express confusion over immigrants voting for Trump, or Brexit. Fundamentally I can see why it shouldn't make sense, but we forget that immigrants are not one masse, with one end goal, or one singular belief. Immigrants still reserve the right to be as nuanced, as complex, as three-dimensional, and, dare I say it, as problematic as anyone else. But if I were to say there were immigrant qualities I could make some kind of sweeping statement with, it would be to point out a braveness, a resilience, and a yearning that I've not quite seen in the same way elsewhere.

Do you think an immigrant writing about their experience in the current social climate is a political statement in itself?NS: I think immigrant writing in any social climate is political. I think writing is political. Art is political. The choice to actively write about oppression or joy is political. The desire to arm marginalized young people with mirrors and language with which to navigate the realities of the world they are in is political. There has never been a time in the recent history of the U.K. or U.S. where being from an immigrant background hasn't been political in one way or another.

Is there one particular essay from the collection that resonates with you personally?

NS: God, how do you choose your favorite child? As a comedy fan, I love Krutika [Mallikarjuna]'s essay. It's hilarious. As is Maeve [Higgins]'s. Tejal Rao is a food writer whose work I admire deeply. Also, I've known her since we were kids, and me and her brother were best mates, so getting to work with her three decades later is a joy. Priya Minhas, for me, signals the core strength of both anthologies, which is ensuring we give space to new writers with a lot to say. Working with heroes like Teju [Cole], Alexander [Chee], Jenny [Zhang], Daniel [José Older], and Porochista is a dream come true. I could say something complimentary about all of them. But the truth is, Chimene may be my sister and my favorite collaborator and my best friend, but this relationship started because I loved her work first and foremost. She is one of my favorite writers. And both her essays, in both collections, have ached. And made me cry.

CS: Sadly, I can identify with so many aspects of so many of the pieces. But I relate the most to Yann Demange (who directed White Boy Rick, Top Boy, and '71). There are so many parallels: being Middle Eastern, but light-skinned; being Muslim, culturally and historically, but still with distance to the religion; being Londoners, and a very specific kind of U.K.-Garage-loving-Londoner at that. In his piece, when he wrote about having another version of his name, and the reasons why, it really hit me. We both have Westernized versions of our names, and that can really eat you when you're trying to respond to your own identity. In the U.K. version of The Good Immigrant, my piece talked at great length about my first and last names being different to Chimene Suleyman, something that was meant to appease the whiteness I was growing up around. I fully understood what his piece was about, the feeling that you just don't belong anywhere at all, a constant sense of homelessness.

What do you hope readers take away from The Good Immigrant?

NS: To ensure you center immigrant voices when talking about immigration issues. To remind yourself that behind the word ""immigrant"" is a person. And, to paraphrase Reni Eddo-Lodge, instead of being a good ally to me or Chimene or the contributors, work out where you hold power and influence, and make change there.

CS: When I first started writing I used to want to convince people of things. To educate them, and change their minds. These days, if that happens, it's an added bonus. But it's not my priority. I want the people who feel like no one tells their stories to finally feel like there actually is space for them. I want someone growing up—some brown immigrant kid with two versions of her name, who prays to Allah and eats pork, who doesn't know where in the fucking world she fits—to read The Good Immigrant and think, Thank god. I'm not alone.

Now, Kaepernick’s lawyer predicts the 31-year-old will return to the NFL.

Mark Geragos, who represented Kaepernick, told CNN.com, “I’m going to make a bold prediction that one of three teams picks him up. The natural would be if Cam Newton is out, then the natural place would be to play with Eric (Reid) in Carolina.”

Newtown make take the season off due to a shoulder injury.

That said, Kaepernick has not made any public statements about returning to the NFL. He has many projects in the works, which includes an animated series about his childhood created by Ava DuVernay.

As for the lawsuit, the NFL and Kaepernick’s attorneys released a statement on Friday that read, “For the past several months, counsel for Mr. Kaepernick and Mr. Reid have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL. As a result of those discussions, the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances. The resolution of this matter is subject to a confidentiality agreement so there will be no further comment by any party.”

While the details of the settlement are not known, Yahoo Sports reports they were “told on prior occasions that Kaepernick and Reid would only settle the complaint if a lucrative financial agreement was reached between the players and the NFL.”

Kaepernick and Reid case, which was filed in October of 2017, alleged that the NFL teams were in violation of the anti-collusion clause of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Kaepernick’s attorney claimed he was not signed because the NFL and the owners, “colluded to deprive Mr. Kaepernick of employment rights in retaliation for Mr. Kaepernick’s leadership and advocacy for equality and social justice and his bringing awareness to peculiar institutions still undermining racial equality in the United States.”

ESPN reports that there was about to hearing on the case, which would have been “semi-public” and “could have exposed inner workings of league business, along with the details of depositions attorneys have taken with high-level executives and in some owners.” Therefore, it sounds like it was in the NFL’s best interest to settle.

Congrats to Kaepernick and Reid for staying in the fight. We will see what Kaep’s NFL career holds.

262,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/02/18/tmz-grand-jury-review-smollett-case/,2019-02-18 00:00:00,TMZ: Grand jury to review Smollett case,"['Ed Morrissey', 'Jazz Shaw', 'John Sexton']",https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cnn-smollett.png,"['review', 'smolletts', 'grand', 'case', 'sources', 'attack', 'chicago', 'tmz', 'smollett', 'jury', 'jussie']","If Jussie Smollett wants to rescue his claim with the Chicago PD, the window may be closing — quickly. According to TMZ, Chicago prosecutors plan to bring the case to the grand jury as soon as next week. If police have flipped the two Nigerian brothers who participated in a hoax, that might be a bit more than the usual “ham sandwich” case, too:

A grand jury will hear the Jussie Smollett case early next week … law enforcement sources tell TMZ. Law enforcement sources connected to the investigation tell TMZ, the 2 brothers who were arrested and then released are staying somewhere around the Loop in downtown Chicago under the watchful eye of police so no one gets to them. We’re told cops especially want to make sure Jussie does not contact the brothers.

Yes, it’s TMZ, which isn’t exactly known for its cautious approach to reporting. However, the question of a grand jury proceeding has come up in Chicago’s local media as well. The police aren’t denying it, although they’re not confirming it either:

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him. Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources. “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he said.

But what about the earlier threat on Smollett — the one in the crude letter the actor claims to have received before the attack? TMZ has some news on that as well:

We’re told when police raided the home of the 2 brothers they found magazines with pages torn out, and authorities are now trying to determine if the missing pages are connected to the threatening letter that was sent to Jussie 8 days before the alleged attack. … The sources say there were red flags from the get-go. Cops were extremely suspicious when Jussie took them out to the area where he said he was attacked and pointed to an obscure camera saying how happy he was that the attack was on video. Turns out the camera was pointing in the wrong direction. Cops thought it was weird he knew the location of that camera. And, there’s this. We’re told investigators didn’t believe the 2 alleged attackers screamed, “This is MAGA country,” because, “Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire.'”

Or because it’s Chicago. How many votes did Trump get there? Five, maybe? It would have made it pretty easy for police to track down any “MAGA country” claims.

“There were always questions,” Alisyn Camerota commented this morning, “about some of the more strange elements of this story.” If so, CNN and other media outlets certainly didn’t let those questions get in the way of their reporting it as an example of racism and homophobia in the Age of Trump. CNN’s Ryan Young agreed with Camerota and also reported that their sources say the police now believe Smollett “orchestrated the attack.” Young positioned himself in the neighborhood itself and noted how it doesn’t fit with Smollett’s narrative:

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation tell CNN that Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month.@RyanYoungNews reports: https://t.co/6CaJhCLUOm pic.twitter.com/EqZP0rR6it — CNN (@CNN) February 18, 2019

Maybe news agencies can stop playing so much of Smollett’s interviews. We’ve heard his side of things ad infinitum. We could use more footage of Democratic presidential candidates pouncing on the Smollett story, however, and especially of their backpedaling now.

Back to the grand jury move, which is a smart choice by law enforcement in a high-profile case. That lets them off the hook for directly filing a criminal charge against Smollett and protects them from accusations of bias and bigotry. If a grand jury returns an indictment, it immediately gains significant credibility.

It may have had its desired immediate effect, too. Smollett’s attorneys have agreed to make him available to detectives as soon as later today after several days of vacillating:

As the Chicago police investigation into the reported attack on Jussie Smollett enters new territory, the “Empire” actor’s attorney says Smollett plans to speak with detectives as soon as Monday. One of Smollett’s newly retained attorneys, Todd Pugh, told the Sun-Times on Sunday that the actor and his legal team “expect to [be] back online tomorrow with the investigators.” Pugh said a possible sit-down would depend on “scheduling availability.”

Police and prosecutors have ways to incentivize “scheduling availability.” Alerting a grand jury certainly qualifies as such. Smollett may yet be proven accurate, but that’s not the way things look at the moment."

On the day the news broke, Pelosi tweeted, ""The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.""

While Nancy Pelosi deleted her tweet, most of the big-name celebrities who posted on social media in support of Smollett — most notably Lee Daniels' video statement — have yet to take down their posts.

On the other side of the spectrum, Donald Trump Jr. has been hammering celebrities who spoke out on Smollett's behalf, tweeting Monday morning, ""Hey Hollywood and media types, I’ve noticed a lot of you deleted your #JusticeForJussie tweets... what’s the matter, don’t you want justice for him anymore??? #frauds.""

“Here is the truth,” Bryan Cranston’s character Howard Beale says in a monologue. “The real truth, the thing we must be most afraid of is the destructive power of absolute beliefs — that we can know anything conclusively, absolutely — whether we are compelled to it by anger, fear, righteousness, injustice, indignation.”

“As soon as you have ossified that belief,” he adds, “as soon as you start believing in the absolute, you stop believing in human beings, as mad and tragic as they are… in all their complexity, their otherness, their intractable reality… The only commitment any of us can have is to other people.”

Some people absolutely believed Smollett when he said he was assaulted by two men in Chicago last month.

Now — with police sources telling CNN and other outlets that new evidence suggests Smollett orchestrated the attack — they are revisiting and revising assumptions about the case.

But the allegations merited skepticism from the very start.

Commentator Kmele Foster put it this way on “Reliable Sources” on Sunday: “Two in the morning, almost the coldest night of the year, you were attacked and someone conveniently had a rope? My heart goes out to anyone who gets attacked, but it’s totally appropriate to exercise a bit of skepticism and to exercise a bit of patience in waiting for the facts to develop around this story.”

Here are the latest developments in the case...

Smollett’s camp still says he is a victim

On Saturday night Smollett’s attorneys responded to the new reporting by reiterating that he was a “victim of a hate crime.” They said he did not play a role in the attack.

Smollett himself has not commented publicly since his interview with ABC last week.

The Chicago PD wants to speak with him again

Chicago police detectives have been wanting to follow up with Smollett since Friday night. “We need to speak to him now,” a police spokesman told me on Saturday, to corroborate info from the two men who were persons of interest — both of whom are now cooperating in the case.

Per spokesman Anthony Guglielmi’s most recent tweet on Sunday evening, they’re still waiting to speak with Smollett. The ball is in Smollett’s legal team’s court.

What Fox is saying

Nothing.

In the immediate aftermath of the alleged attack, Fox — which makes and airs “Empire” — took Smollett’s word for it and said the company “stands united” against any act of violence and hate.

A few days ago, amid rumors that Smollett might have concocted the attack because he was concerned about being written off “Empire,” Fox said that was ridiculous: “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.” Over the weekend, Fox representatives said the company had no new comment.

Why this story is so complicated

When Smollett reported the alleged crime to the police, many people figured Smollett was telling the truth. The allegation immediately had political significance because TMZ reported that Smollett said the attackers called Chicago “MAGA country.”

Was there a rush to judgment in some quarters? Yes. Did some liberal celebrities and Democratic politicians issue statements that weren’t supported by the facts? Yes. Did some Trump supporters feel insulted by the news coverage of the case? Yes.

But at the same time: Was it newsworthy when the police opened an investigation into Smollett’s accusation? Yes. Did high-quality news organizations approach the case with caution? Yes. Did local and national news organizations poke holes in his “hate crime” account? Yes.

Kmele Foster and Liz Plank discussed the rush to judgment issue on Sunday’s “Reliable Sources.” Foster urged skepticism on the part of the press — he said some people had doubts about Smollett’s story early on, but “were afraid to raise the questions because of the intersectional nature of this particular accusation,” afraid their motives would be challenged.

Plank was more concerned about the downstream effects of a potential hate-crime hoax. “The fact that one robbery was faked does not mean robbery is not a problem,” she said. “The fact that there is one false rape accusation does not mean that there’s no rape. We have to cover these issues as trends and as patterns.” Bill Carter also joined in… Watch part one and part two of the segment here…

How the narrative is changing

The national outrage about Smollett’s apparent suffering “was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media,” the AP’s Lindsey Bahr pointed out in this story.

But the outrage “has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement,” she wrote. And the authorities still aren’t commenting, so this case is still a mystery.

More than 100 schools in Britain will be closed today as the wintry 'Mini Beast From The East' continues to wreak havoc across the UK.

The Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for snow until 3am on Monday in South West England and a yellow weather warning for ice has been issued across the rest of the country until 10am - although the affects of the bad weather may last much longer.

The majority of the 100 school closures in Britain are in Devon, while all schools in Blaenau Gwent, Wales, will remain closed tomorrow along with some in Powys, Wales.

Highways England warned motorists to be careful out on the roads. The agency tweeted: 'If you're travelling in the South West this morning, widespread severe weather conditions due to snow... our contractors are working hard to keep roads open, check before you travel this morning.'

Devon County Council has described roads as 'treacherous' and train services into the area are expected to be affected as well.

Temperatures could feel as if they are as low as -10C in parts of the UK today, with some places expected to see up to 15 inches in snow.

Devon and Cornwall Police tweeted: 'Further snow expected into the early hours of Monday. Police and partner agencies continue to work hard to keep roads open and people safe.

'Drivers are warned to expect snow and icy conditions on morning commute. Only travel if you have to and leave extra time for your journey.'

Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell said: 'Tonight the main risk is disruptive snowfall which is across south west England. We've got an amber weather warning in force in the next few hours and into the early hours of the morning.

'So quite widely we could see 5cm perhaps at lower levels, and by the end of the night we could see 30-40cm in places across Dartmoor and Exmoor, and generally over higher ground.'

Ms Mitchell said there will be 'really tricky' travelling conditions as snow begins to drift.

Southern counties of England and parts of South Wales could see a few centimeters of snow by this morning, and people have been urged to look out for ice following the sub-zero temperatures.

The forecaster warned of ice and said temperatures in many places will be below freezing.

Advising drivers who do have to head out today, Ella Colley Halfords' winter expert, said: 'With the Mini Beast From The East hitting the UK, and snow hitting most areas, we're advising drivers to check their wipers – they need to be in good working order to clear the windscreen.

'Poor visibility doesn't just make driving in the snow unpleasant but failing to see a hazard quickly can slow your reaction time.

'Drivers should also give their car a quick health check by checking screen wash, tyre pressure and keeping extra clothes, warm drinks and a mobile phone handy.'

Britain is set for more bad weather with heavy rain and snow expected to arrive in time for the Easter holidays.

Downpours are expected to batter the UK with up to 40mm of rain due to fall over parts of the North, followed by more snow with bitterly cold northerly winds sending temperatures plummeting to -4C.

A Met Office spokesperson said that the mild temperatures would drop in the coming days with areas of low pressure bringing on heavy showers into the new week.

Families hoping for sunnier Spring-time weather over the Easter holidays could be left bitterly disappointed as more frost and snow is expected over parts of the North East and into the North.

This comes after Britons have experienced treacherous conditions with snow and frost causing cimmuter chaos during March.

A weatherman for the BBC said: 'Some computer models are suggesting that we are going to have a blast of cold Arctic air with wind coming in from the north.

'In this situation we do tend to get snow across northern Britain and there could even be wintry showers further south as well.

'That's one suggestion. Today some of the computer models were showing that actually some of the cold air could be coming in from Scandinavia and parts of Russia which is almost a Beast from the East, not quite, let's call it a Beast from the North East.

'Now this could still wobble a little bit but one thing we are getting increasingly confident about it that the air is not going to be coming from the south so get ready for a potentially chilly Easter.'

Forecaster Amy Hodgson, of The Weather Channel, told The Mirror the chilly outlook is still in response to the sudden stratospheric warming event and polar vortex split which took place back in February.

She added that the extended cold period is caused by high pressure blocking warmer air from sweeping across the country from the south-west.

Heavy snow overnight on Sunday left snow drifts six foot high. Above, vehicles stranded near Ilfracombe, north Devon on Monday

She said: 'For April, we expect temperatures to remain below normal across northern Europe.

'This is still in response to the sudden stratospheric warming event (SSWE) and polar vortex split which occurred back in February.'

While research by Dr Todd Crawford, chief meteorologist at The Weather Channel, told the paper these events can lead to prolonged cold weather and a negative North Atlantic Oscillation 30 to 60 days after the initial split.

Meteorologists are warning Easter weekend is predicted to be unseasonably chilly, with extreme lows of -9C in places

Bitterly cold winds from the east and north-east normally dominate during a negative North Atlantic Oscillation phase.

This could mean one more 'Beast from the East' could occur before May as dry and cold conditions take charge under high pressure throughout much of April.

He said: 'As we head into April, most computer forecast models suggest we will get at least one more big cold spell before the blocking pattern fades, with warmer and wetter weather confined to parts of southern Europe.'

Britons travelling this Easter are bracing for potential travel chaos on the roads and rails as forecasters warn of a 'Beast from the East Mark 3' bringing conditions more commonly associated with Christmas.

Engineering works will hit major train routes across the UK including the west coast main line, London and East Anglia, while Northern, South Western Railway and the Docklands Light Railway could all be hit by strike action.

Journeys on motorways could take up to 90 minutes longer on Maundy Thursday, with the M25 around the capital expected to be worst hit between 4pm and 6pm, while delays are also expected on the M1, M4, M5 and M6.

The Met Office has warned temperatures will get 'increasingly colder' in the UK later this week, dropping as low as -5C (23F) overnight, while northern and central areas could have snow on Good Friday and Saturday.

There will be no long distance trains to or from London Euston on Sunday due to renewal work in the Wembley area, while Bristol Temple Meads will be shut as Network Rail carries out its largest ever resignalling project.

Buses will replace trains on routes including Edinburgh to Glasgow, Hull to Selby in East Yorkshire, London to Ingatestone in Essex, Crewe to Liverpool, Carlisle to Scotland, and Sevenoaks to Tonbridge in Kent.

Rail services are also due to be hit by strike action by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union at Arriva Rail North (Northern) who will walk out for 24 hours on Thursday in the long-running row over the role of guards.

The company has been embroiled in a year-long argument with the union over staffing and guards, which is also affecting four other train operators, including South Western Railway (SWR).

RMT members on SWR will refuse to work rest days over the four day Easter weekend, starting on Good Friday, accusing the company of refusing to engage with the union.

Meanwhile, talks are being held today to try to avert a 48-hour stoppage by RMT members on London's Docklands Light Railway (DLR) later this week over claims of a 'comprehensive breakdown' in industrial relations.

Network Rail said it will have 15,000 engineers and contractors working over the Easter weekend on more than 400 projects as part of a £118million investment plan across the country.

Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: 'It's being dubbed as the Beast from the East Mark 3, but as with most trilogies, the third edition is never as good.

'At the moment the exact details for the Easter weekend are uncertain but it looks like from Wednesday onwards colder conditions and spells of snow are likely.

'The snow will be mainly across central and northern areas of the UK, and mostly across the high ground but there is the chance of snow to low levels of these areas too which may lead to some disruption.

'However, it's not expected to be as extreme as the last couple of cold wintry spells we've experienced recently due to the sun being stronger this time of the year and we're also are a lot further into spring now.'

Some long-range forecasters are also predicting a second bout of cold weather will strike in mid-April, after the country suffered some of the coldest March days on record - and the worst snowstorms in decades.

The cold weather – which raises the prospect of travel chaos during the big Easter getaway - is being caused by the break-up of the polar vortex, a large area of cold air that normally sits over the North Pole.

A change in the polar jet stream in February triggered a phenomenon known as Sudden Stratospheric Warming, causing cold winds to be pushed over northern Europe and the US for the last two months.

It would be the first white Easter since 2013, when Arctic weather produced the coldest Easter Sunday on record. Before then, the last white Easter was in 2010, the year of another bitterly cold winter.

The 'Beast from the East' hit at the end of last month, causing motorists to be stranded overnight by snow and the cancellation of hundreds of flights and train journeys. A further 'Mini Beast from the East' then hit on March 17.

Christmas Day last year was mild, rainy and overcast - with only a scattering of snow high in the hills of northern Scotland. Temperatures also peaked at around 12C (54F) - well above the average of 9C (48F) for March in the UK."

Britain could be basking in the hottest April for nearly a decade next week as temperatures look set to soar again.

Despite the dreary and wet start to today, temperatures are set to climb gradually into the latter part of next week, with temperatures hitting a toasty 24C by Thursday.

Last year saw temperatures hit 25C, making it the hottest April day for seven years, so if the temperature climbs slightly above the current forecast, it would set a new record.

Meanwhile today, Britain will be cloudier and cooler for vast swathes of the UK and a strengthening breeze, with the best of the weather in Scotland.

Showers are forecast across parts of the South West and Wales and will be pushed eastwards as the day goes on. Temperatures are down on yesterday's highs of 19C, with most of the UK enjoying temperatures between 12C and 14C.

Any remaining rain will clear away northwards by Monday, with a dry day for most with some sunny spells. Temperatures will remain fairly similar to Sunday, but further rain and strong winds, particularly in coastal areas, will arrive across the far west by the evening.

A distinct divide will begin to occur between the south and the east, in comparison to the north and the west. Wet and windy weather is forecast for the north and west while the south and the east will be drier and warmer.

Come Thursday, Mediterranean and Spanish winds will be pushing over the UK, bringing with it much warmer air that spans a 1,500 mile radius 'African plume'.

Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell told MailOnline: 'After yesterday's warm day, we're expecting a few days of rather unsettled weather but gradually becoming more settled as we get later into the week.

'Today rain will be pushing in from the South West and falling on parts of Wales and Northern Ireland, which will gradually make its way east as the day goes on.'

The rain will be followed by a 'gradual improvement' during the week with highs on Monday similar to those on Saturday, though there could still be wet weather in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Temperatures could reach 70 to 73F (21 to 23C) by Tuesday or Wednesday, he said, with the warmest weather predicted north-west of London and in the Midlands thanks to warm air coming in from the continent.

Craig Snell, from the Met Office, said: 'Low pressure to the west and high pressure to the east means we're importing warmer as we go into next week, helped by the increase in sunshine.

'Next week looks pretty promising if you want some warmer weather. It looks pretty dry for most of the working week in England and Wales. It's a first warm spell of weather.'

Britain could be hotter than Portugal this weekend with highs of 16C expected in some parts of the UK - but flood warnings are in place with thunderstorms on their way.

The country is still thawing out from the chilling effects of the Beast from the East and Storm Emma but a swell of tropical air will send temperatures soaring.

But some parts of the UK are braced for more wild weather, with snow falling in Scotland today and warnings of thunderstorms for the south west on Saturday.

A Met Office forecaster said: 'This weekend will be a great deal warmer than it has been and will be quite spring like going into early next week.

'We'll have lots of sunshine and temperatures on Friday will be around 10C in the south and 7C in the north. But rain will approach the south west shortly and will then work its way north. But it will be breezy rather than windy.'

Once the rain is out of the way the country will bask in warm weather - with temperatures set to reach highs of 16C on Saturday.

The forecaster said: 'Once the rain is out of the way we'll have quite a mild afternoon. Temperatures in London and the south are likely to reach 14C. And it could reach 16C in some parts of the south east.

'It will make the it mildest day of the year so far.'

This means the UK could be hotter than Lisbon, Portugal, which is due to have highs of 14C.

The south west is braced for flooding with the heavy rain due tomorrow.

Sunday should see most of the country enjoy dry spells with relatively light winds - but rain will approach the south west as the day wears on.

Temperatures will reach highs of 14C.

Monday and early next week will be wet and windy, the Met Office said.

The south in particular will be battling strong winds while the north will generally be drier and brighter.

There will be a risk of frost overnight.

This weekend's expected warm temperatures come just days after the so-called Pest from the West blanketed large parts of the country in snow.

Parts of northern England found themselves buried under 4cm of snow."

A Tennessee man is charged with wanton endangerment after allegedly pulling a gun on a supporter of President Donald Trump at a Sam’s Club in Bowling Green, Kentucky, according to a news report.

But he picked the wrong guy to pick on.

According to WBKO in Bowling Green, the incident took place Saturday, when a man identified as James Phillips allegedly accosted a Trump supporter named Terry Pierce because Pierce was wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap.

Pierce told police he wasn’t backing down.

“I have as much right to wear that hat and support my country and my president as he has not to,” he said, according to WBKO.

Things reportedly got more dangerous, though.

Pierce, who was with his wife at the time of the confrontation, told WBKO that Phillips “pulled a .40 caliber out and stuck it in my face, backed up and said, ‘It’s a good day for you to die.’”

The response Pierce said he gave is one for the books:

“I said, ‘Then pull the trigger. Put the gun down and fight me or pull the trigger. Whichever one you want,’” he told WBKO. “And he backed up and he said it again, he said, ‘It’s a good day for you to die.'”

Pierce said Phillips backed down and left, but Pierce followed him to his car.

“I went out the front of the store to confront him again and that’s when I got him in his car. He couldn’t leave because his mother was still in the store. And we were having a verbal altercation outside,” Pierce told WBKO.

According to WNKY in Bowling Green, police were called to the scene by witnesses who reported seeing a man pull a gun on a couple.

WNKY reported that Phillips said he’d only made an obscene gesture with his finger at the couple because of the MAGA hats

“He tried telling me I assaulted him and I said, ‘I never touched you,'” Pierce told WBKO.

According to the station, a surveillance camera captured an altercation between the two men, but does not show Phillips with the gun because he was backing out of the camera’s range.

However, according to WBKO, the police report states Phillips had a Glock .40 in his back pocket with a round in the chamber and two more magazines in another pocket. (The station reported Phillips has a concealed carry license in Tennessee, which is honored in Kentucky.)

Now, let’s stipulate a couple of things. We have only Pierce’s version of events at this point. A criminal charge isn’t a conviction. And since the security camera didn’t actually catch Phillips pointing a gun, there’s no way of knowing, objectively, exactly what happened here.

But considering how Democratic presidential candidates and liberal celebrities jumped to blame rampant racism in America for the reported attack on television star Jussie Smollett in January, it would be interesting to see if they were going to be equally outraged by a report where a man allegedly pointed a loaded gun at a couple he didn’t know, simply because they weren’t afraid to show their support for President Donald Trump publicly.

And considering there were actual witnesses who said they saw the man pull the gun, and police found an actual gun in the suspect’s pocket, it’s a fair bet there’s more to this story of attempted political terrorism in Kentucky than there ever was to Smollett’s tale.

It’s also hardly a surprise.

The liberal media – and the many Democrats running for president – will never admit it, but this is exactly the atmosphere they’re fostering, with a never-ending series of attacks on anyone who chooses to associate with the Trump administration.

The teenagers from Covington, Kentucky, who were attacked by the media in January were wearing “Make America Great Again” hats, too – which was probably their biggest sin in the eyes of the liberal world.

In a population of more than 300 million people, it’s almost a certainty that someone is going to get carried away in that kind of atmosphere. The country should just be thankful that at the moment there’s just a guy charged with wanton endangerment in Kentucky, rather than a more serious crime that leaves dead bodies behind.

The country should also be grateful for citizens who don’t back down when their political beliefs are threatened on what should be a routine trip to a store. (By anybody’s standard, “Pull the trigger or fight me fair” is about the ultimate badass response in a situation like that.)

If Pierce’s story is true, one person who might not be so grateful about the whole thing is Phillips’ mom. If Phillips really was her ride to Sam’s Club in Bowling Green that day, and Pierce’s story is true, she’s got bigger problems on her hands than the rest of us.

During a press conference yesterday, Ali, who is the director of Project Islamic HOPE, said Smollett’s actions were an insult to real victims of hate crime.

“It’s a slap in the face. We have many members of the black community and the LGBTQ community who have been the victims of racism and hate crimes, so for Smollett to say that he was a victim…and we believe is a lie…certainly is an injustice to those true victims…,” Ali said. “Jussie Smollett must be brought to justice for lying.”

Ali also expressed concern that Smollett “could have created a race war” because more “extreme” members of the black community were so angry that they wanted to “retaliate” violently.

“If Jussie Smollett really wants to do what’s right, he’ll stop this campaign of lies,” said Ali.

After initially believing the story that Smollett was attacked by racist Trump supporters who yelled, “This is MAGA country,” Ali said he changed his mind after Smollett’s “campaign of lies continued to be unraveled.”

Ali’s response is more honest than most leftists’ reaction, the vast majority of whom have refused to address the issue despite vociferous initial tweets that blamed the attack on Trump and his supporters before any evidence was in.

Leftists after several pieces of evidence suggest Smollett staged attack; ""We have to wait for the evidence!"" — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) February 18, 2019

As Michael David Smith highlights, it appears as though Smollett thought police had two innocent men in custody and was ready to testify against them for carrying out the attack.

Only when he found out that the two suspects in custody were the Nigerian brothers he allegedly paid to stage the attack did Smollett change his mind.

If this is true, it's horrific. The implication is that Jussie Smollett thought the police had two innocent men in custody and he said he would testify against them. Only when he realized the cops got the right guys-the guys he orchestrated the hoax with-did he refuse to comply. pic.twitter.com/7Ka7RSI7OW — Michael David Smith (@MichaelDavSmith) February 18, 2019

Police sources told reporters that new evidence suggests Smollett hired two friends from Nigeria to stage an attack on him in the streets of downtown Chicago on January 29.

Smollett claimed he was targeted by two masked Trump supporters who physically assaulted him, tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him, yelled “This is ‘MAGA’ country,” and called the actor a “f*****” and a “n*****.”

“Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the ‘Empire’ actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store the weekend of Jan. 25. The brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return,” CBS News Chicago reports.

Moreover, Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi confirmed “that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

The new revelations highlight Smollett’s past comments following the attack. During an interview with Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts, for example, the “Empire” star chastised “doubters” for questioning his dubious account of the alleged attack and suggested they wouldn’t be skeptical if his “attackers” were “Muslim” or “Mexican” and not white Trump supporters.

“It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks. It’s not that you don’t believe this is the truth; you don’t even want to see this is the truth,” he told Roberts, later adding: “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would’ve supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Notably, four days following the alleged attack, Smollett performed a concert in West Hollywood and told the crowd that he “fought the f*** back,” branding himself the “gay Tupac.”

“Above all, I fought the f*** back,” the actor told the audience, fighting back tears amid tremendous applause. “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Smollett said the same during his GMA interview, making it clear that gay men are not weak and speaking highly of his advocacy for the LGBT community.

“The most important thing I can say is thank you so much, and I’m okay,” Smollett said at the start of the West Hollywood show, according to USA Today. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. I’m going to stand strong with you all. … I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those motherf***ers win. I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

According to The Guardian, “Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things. He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.”

Smollett has denied the accusations.

Two brothers were arrested in connection with the attack on Wednesday but police released them on Friday, citing new “evidence.” The men are reportedly still cooperating with the investigation.

In the early hours of January 29, Smollett was hospitalized and told authorities he’d been attacked by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs. He said the men had tied a noose around his neck and poured some sort of chemical substance on him, and at one point reportedly shouted “this is MAGA country.” CNN has learned that Chicago Police have evidence the two brothers purchased the rope used for the noose at an Ace Hardware Store.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett’s lawyers said in a statement. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett has been an Empire regular since 2015."

""I remember reading about this story and looking for a real, reputable media outlet reporting on that, and I could not find one, right?"" she told Stelter. ""The people who were repeating that quote were not news outlets, were not media outlets. It was repeated by ... people who maybe had good intentions on wanting to spread the story and had empathy for what they thought was, you know, a real story. But we can't confuse celebrity tweets with the media and the press.""

Stelter asked, ""So you're saying actors and activists who were rushing to his side because they're friends with him and they support him and they're concerned about a possible hate crime are not the same as Chicago reporters who were trying to find out what happened."" Plank answered ""yes"" several times.

Not so fast

First off, Plank may want to invest in a better search engine.

Several media outlets noted that initial ""MAGA country"" report from TMZ and spelled out its details, including Vanity Fair, Slate, People, and The Root's Grapevine. It isn't clear if Plank saw the aforementioned outlets' reports or considers them ""reputable"" or part of the ""news"" media, but they certainly weren't difficult to find that first day — and those reports most definitely don't qualify as ""celebrity tweets"" about the incident.

What's more, quite a few journalists hit Twitter after the initial reports of the alleged attack — which now, police sources say, appears to have been orchestrated by Smollett himself — and cited that TMZ report and spewed unsubstantiated claims, many noting that that ""MAGA"" supporters were behind it. Mediaite's Caleb Howe noted who they are:

A senior entertainment reporter for the Daily Beast incorrectly reported the alleged attackers were wearing ""MAGA"" hats and had a few other things to say:

Anything else?

It should be noted that Chicago police never mentioned anything about ""MAGA"" in initial statements. But after police noticed media outlets reporting that tidbit, they interviewed Smollett again, and that's when he added the ""MAGA"" claim.

And regarding Plank's reactions to the initial Smollett incident, she retweeted an unsubstantiated claim from Raquel Willis, the executive editor of Out Magazine, who implied that ""white supremacy"" fueled the alleged attack:

Here's the clip of Plank speaking to Stelter. She also lectured fellow panelist Kmele Foster — who is black and far from a Smollett fan — about about hate crimes and FBI stats. It's not what you might call a very good look:

The MSC Seaside, which launched in 2017, is the 18th biggest cruise ship in the world.

It weighs 153,516 tons and can accommodate 5,179 passengers, along with 1,500 crew.

Such a big ship requires everything to be done on a mass scale, as the yet-to-air documentary shows.

'This is one of the most huge generators in the world,' one worker says from the depths of the engineering room, while chef Ulrich highlights that 'any cruise ship this size is the biggest food operation in the world'.

A spokesperson for MSC Seaside told MailOnline Travel that each week, 107,499 plates are served in the dining rooms.

And over the course of seven days 140,000 eggs are used, 18,000kg of fresh fruit is sliced and 5.1 tons of flour is sifted.

Just last Thursday, anchor Robin Roberts had given the actor a softball interview, even refusing to call his story of a Trump supporter assaulting him, “alleged.”

Leading into the report, Roberts finally did call the quickly unraveling story “alleged:”

""A new twist in the Jussie Smollett case. The actor firing back this morning as the story of his alleged attack faces questions. Police in Chicago say they're working to corroborate allegations that Smollett paid two men to stage the assault,"" she stated.

In reporter Eva Pilgrim’s report, she tried to save face for ABC, stressing that police had said Smollett was “cooperating fully” with the investigation up until this point. Pilgrim did not mention that the Chicago Police Department also said Smollett would only give partial, redacted phone records to them.

Roberts followed up by defending her interview with the actor, as appropriate given the knowledge they had at the time:

This case is ever evolving. Head-spinning. Changing. When I sat down with Jussie, it was Tuesday night in Chicago. At the time to give his first account publicly give his first account of what he said happened. And we have to remember, at that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent. It was credible. And that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday and then we found out about the brothers.

Afterwards, the ABC team brought on the network’s legal analyst, Dan Abrams, to help do more damage control, spinning Roberts’ interview as more even-handed than it was by hyping the few times she had gingerly brought up skeptics of his story:

[I] have to say, Robin, even in the interview you did, you were talking about the skeptics. You were talking about the people who questioned his account. So, it's not new this idea that there are questions about what happened. What's new is that the police now seem to be making it clear that they believe the brothers and have, at the very least, serious questions about Jussie.

To end their segment, ABC hammered home how they weren’t responsible for how much airtime his problematic story got to begin with. GMA’s weekend anchor Dan Harris worried that just Smollett, not their network or the media as a whole, had caused damage for actual victims of hate crimes. Dan Abrams agreed, even admitting that the media “wanted” to believe Smollett’s account.

Again, the ABC team wouldn’t acknowledge the media’s role in spreading his dubious account:

DAN HARRIS: If Smollett made this up, what kind of impact does this have on other people that come forward to tell stories that are true about assault? ABRAMS: I think that is the real impact here. I think this would have a big impact on the country. Which is, you want to believe someone. I mean, you're talking about an allegation of homophobia, racism, politics, all of it in one allegation. If it turns out that this well-known person just made this up, it's going to, I think, lead some people to have questions about coming forward. It will lead others having questions about whether they believe people's accounts. This is having a much bigger impact I think than just on this particular case. ROBERTS: All across the board. MICHAEL STRAHAN: Could be a big setback if that's the case.

NBC’s Today and CBS This Morning also ran reports on the updated story. CBS anchor Gayle King was reluctant to believe Smollett had lied:

""Yes. It is a very interesting turn in this case. I know people who talked to Jussie over the weekend. He insists that he had nothing to do the story. The more you hear, the more questions that are being raised. The investigation we should stress is still underway,"" she gushed."

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

Last month, Smollett claimed that he was assaulted by two men in a racist and homophobic attack, sparking an outpouring of support for him and condemnation of the alleged attack. Yet on Saturday, Chicago police revealed that the focus of the investigation had “shifted.” CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz reported that authorities now believe that Smollett actually paid two men to fake the attack, both of whom were now cooperating with law enforcement.

According to law enforcement officials who spoke with TMZ, a grand jury will hear the case next week to examine its credibility. The police sources also provided details on why Smollett’s claims seemingly lacked credibility.

“The sources say there were red flags from the get-go,” TMZ reported. “Cops were extremely suspicious when Jussie took them out to the area where he said he was attacked and pointed to an obscure camera saying how happy he was that the attack was on video. Turns out the camera was pointing in the wrong direction. Cops thought it was weird he knew the location of that camera.”

Smollett’s lawyers have denied his involvement in planning the attack, claiming their clients is “devastated” by any suggestion that he would do so.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” they said in a statement. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Sharpton pointed out his reaction to the story when it first came out when he said the perpetrators should “suffer the maximum,” saying Smollett should do the same if he created the hoax.

“I, among many others, when hearing of the report said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come within law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum. I still maintain that. And if it is found that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetrate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.”

He later added, “Let us get to the bottom of it and let justice be done no matter who is right or wrong. We cannot not get to the truth here.”

In the development of a live vaccines, the organism can be “attenuated” or weakened. Because live vaccine can replicate in humans, they can be given by nasal or oral route but may produce a mild form of the disease. Vaccines containing inactivate organisms are safer because they cannot produce a mild form of the disease. However, inactivated vaccines must be injected and require an adjuvant, a kind of immune response booster, which will increase the immune response. Adjuvants are usually composed of an oil base that serves to slowly release vaccine particles, which continually stimulate the immune response over time. The adjuvants are typically what causes some pain and inflammation after injection.

The purpose of vaccination is to stimulate the immune response to prevent a disease. A person who is rendered resistant to a disease by vaccination is termed “actively immunized.” Active immunity may also result from recovery from a natural outbreak of a disease. Immunity transferred from plasma from a donor, which contains antibodies from a prior infection or vaccination is referred to as “passive immunity.” This type of immunity is immediate, but only temporary and is used mainly for treatment of hospitalized individuals. Various laboratories are also developing synthetic antibodies called “monoclonal antibodies” in cell cultures, which can be mass-produced for treatment of seriously ill patients.

For some vaccines only a portion of the organism can be used to immunize. This is referred to as a subunit vaccine. Subunit vaccines are commonly used against influenza. SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccines have been recently developed using only the immunogenic spike protein of the virus or the RNA or DNA viral genes, which code for the spike protein. In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the portion of its spike protein can induce antibodies which may block the entrance of the virus into the human’s cell membrane. Another type of vaccine is molecular (recombinant) vaccine, which contains an attenuated adenovirus vaccine (vector) combined with genes of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 to trigger production of the immune system to destroy both the adenovirus vector and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The adenovirus, which can cause a cold in humans, has been genetically altered so it is not able to replicate in humans and will not produce disease making it a safe vaccine.

There is always an interval of time between the administration of a vaccine and development of immunity. This varies between vaccines, but usually takes from seven to 14 days. Vaccines can induce a state of immunity, which can persist anywhere from one year to a lifetime. In the case of vaccine lasting only one year, partial protection can last for longer periods. Older individuals or those with reduced immunity do not respond well to vaccines. The capacity to fully respond to vaccines is termed “immunologically competence.” Similarly, to influenza virus vaccines immunologically compromised individuals may need a larger amount of vaccine to induce adequate immunity. At this time no one knows how long immunity will last against a COVID19 vaccine or if a booster vaccine will need to be administered.

Currently there are more than 160 potential vaccines for COVID-19 under study; optimistic experts hope that a viable vaccine may be ready by the end of 2020. Other experts caution that the timeline may be unrealistic. Only a small number of those vaccine candidates are being tested on people, and chances are many of the other projects won’t survive beyond the laboratory stage. Even so, vaccine experts point out that funding has been plentiful, many different approaches are under study and collaborations have developed between small firms developing the vaccines and large drug companies with the capacity to mass produce them—all giving reason for hope. The U.S. said it would fund and conduct the phase III trials—the final step to determine how well the vaccine works and if it’s safe—of three candidates: Moderna Inc., AstraZeneca Inc. and Johnson & Johnson Inc. The Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines are already being tested in people, while Johnson & Johnson recently announced that it will begin its testing in the second half of July.

Here are some of the vaccines that are furthest along, with details on how the vaccine works. Moderna’s vaccine, mRNA-1273, uses messenger RNA, an approach that does not require a virus to make the vaccine. The messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries instructions for making the spike protein, a key protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that allows the virus to enter cells when a person gets infected. When the vaccine with this instruction molecule is injected, it goes to the immune cells and instructs them to make copies of the spike protein, acting as if the cells have been infected with the coronavirus. Allowing other immune cells to develop ways to protect you gives immunity.

This mRNA-1273 vaccine is in phase II of its clinical trial, designed to evaluate safety and effectiveness. Moderna, working with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, intends to enroll 600 healthy volunteers equally divided into two age groups: 18 to 55, and 55 and older. The company announced on June 11 that it will start phase III of its trial in July with 30,000 volunteers. Phase III, the final clinical trial phase, evaluates effectiveness in a much larger group and compares how well the vaccine works compared to a placebo (a substance that does not contain the vaccine). Moderna will test a 100-microgram dose and said the company is on track to deliver 500 million doses per year. In mid-May, the company announced that all eight initial trial volunteers given two different dose amounts reached or surpassed the level of antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus.

University of Oxford scientists are partnering with AstraZeneca to develop a COVID-19 recombinant adenovirus vaccine made from a weakened version of a common cold virus taken from chimpanzees. A number of companies are using the recombinant adenovirus vaccine technique, because prior studies with the SARS and MERS coronaviruses have shown efficacy in animal studies. Recombinant adenovirus is genetically altered so it can’t reproduce itself in humans. A phase I/II clinical trial began in April in the U.K. to assess its safety and how well it works in more than 1,000 healthy volunteers 18 to 55 years old. Now, recruiting has begun for phase II/III trials, which will enroll up to 10,260 adults and children. For both phase II and III, volunteers will receive one or two doses of either the COVID-19 vaccine or a licensed vaccine that will be used as a control for comparison. In early June, Brazil, hard hit with COVID-19 cases, joined the clinical trials, planning to test 2,000 volunteers there. After reaching a license agreement with the University of Oxford and others, AstraZeneca agreed to supply more than 2 billion doses globally, anticipating delivery of 400 million doses before the end of 2020.

Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech Inc. are testing four vaccines, each using messenger RNA, with a different combination of mRNA to targeted antigens (to produce antibodies). Called BNT162, volunteers in Germany and the U.S. have received the vaccine in a phase I/II clinical trial. This trial will evaluate the safety, ability to give immunity and the optimal dose of the four candidates in a single and continuous study. Initially they are testing the vaccine on people 18 to 55 years of age. Once a given dose level is proven safe and effective, older adults will be immunized. Pfizer is predicting the production of millions of vaccine doses in 2020, increasing to hundreds of millions in 2021. Manufacturing sites have been identified both in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Inovio Inc. has developed a vaccine, INO-4800, which is a DNA vaccine in phase I clinical trials, with 40 volunteers. The technology uses DNA designed to produce a specific immune response. A handheld smart device uses a brief electrical pulse to open small pores in the skin to deliver the vaccine. Once the DNA is inside a cell, it instructs it to make many copies of the artificial DNA, and this stimulates the body’s natural immune response. Results from the U.S. phase I trial are expected in June, and a phase II/III trial is expected then to begin. Human trials are also expected to begin this summer in China and South Korea. Multiple partners and collaborators are involved, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and others.

CanSino Biologics Inc. in Tianjin, China, is working with the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology on a coronavirus vaccine using a type of genetically altered adenovirus known as Ad-5. The platform has been used successfully to develop the Ebola virus vaccine. In late May, researchers reported on results of the phase I safety study, in which 108 people got three doses (low, middle, high) of the vaccine. Most volunteers developed immune responses, but fewer had the neutralizing antibodies experts say are crucial to fight off the virus. The company launched phase II in mid-April, with over 500 enrolled.

Sinovac Biotech’s Inc. vaccine, CoronaVac, uses an inactivated version of the virus. Early results of a Phase II clinical trial released in June show that the vaccine induced antibodies to neutralize the virus after 14 days in 90 percent of people who received it. The vaccine requires two injections, given two weeks apart, according to the company. No serious side effects have been reported in either phase I or II trials, which included 743 healthy volunteers. Sinovac will partner with Instituto Butantan Inc. in Brazil to launch a phase III trial. The company said it will develop the vaccine for global use.

Scientists at Imperial College London have developed a vaccine using a concept called ‘”self-amplifying RNA.” The vaccine uses synthetic strands of genetic code, or RNA, based on the genetic material known about the coronavirus. Once injected, that RNA makes copies of itself, then instructs the body’s cells to make copies of the spike protein found on the outside of the virus. This is meant to train the immune system to respond to and fight off the coronavirus. Investigators launched a combined phase I/II study the week of June 15, initially giving the vaccine to 300 healthy volunteers. They will receive two doses over two visits, separated by a four-week interval. If the vaccine is shown to be safe and to produce an immune response, phase III trials would be launched later this year with about 6,000 volunteers. Investigators hope the vaccine could be available by spring 2021.

Johnson & Johnson said it expects to start testing its recombinant vaccine in people in the second half of July. The vaccine combines spike protein gene from the vectored coronavirus with a modified adenovirus. The first trial will include more than 1,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 and others 65 and older and will take place in the U.S. and Belgium.

The Trump administration has chosen five companies for “Operation Warp Speed,” the national program to accelerate the development, production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. They are: Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Merck Inc., Pfizer and BioNTech, and AstraZeneca/Oxford University. Beyond investing in the vaccines, the U.S program will also oversee a plan to streamline and coordinate the testing of vaccines. The five potential vaccines will be evaluated using the same measurements to make comparisons easier, and a single, independent monitoring board will decide if any of vaccines have been proved to work.

Researchers will have access to at least 72 testing sites that have been identified across the country and an equal number in other countries, said Dr. Larry Corey, an expert in vaccine development at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who is helping to orchestrate the government program. The plan relies heavily on testing networks that have been built over the years for work on vaccines against HIV and other pathogens, according to Drs. Corey and Fauci. Testing sites are often based at university medical centers. If researchers can recruit a sufficiently large pool of participants in areas where the virus is infecting high numbers of people, less time probably will be needed to know if a vaccine works. Doing so can be a challenge, especially when dealing with a new virus that is poorly understood. Where the virus will be most active when a vaccine is ready for large-scale testing, for example, is “a moving target,” Corey said. “We have a virus that is sweeping through different areas,” Corey said. “How do we match our clinical trial sites with where the viral activity is the highest?” Brazil and other countries that may be experiencing outbreaks could be chosen for rapid efficacy testing.

The participation of 25,000 to 30,000 people for each vaccine will be needed in the final phase III stage of tests for each of the five vaccines. But it will be up to an independent board of outside experts to decide if that is actually the case for each vaccine. Moderna and AstraZeneca and, later, the other vaccines will be tested in the U.S. government program. To do so, statisticians on the board will perform complex calculations based on the data collected in the large trials to determine whether a vaccine has had a genuine effect that cannot have been due to chance and to estimate the specific level of protection it provides. If a vaccine is, in fact, very effective, those results will become clear quickly because the difference between people who are vaccinated and those who receive the placebo will be stark. In that case, the monitoring board could declare the vaccine a success, clearing the way for it to be put into use. The board probably would need longer to reach a decision about a lower-performing vaccine since it would take time to collect sufficient data to establish its effectiveness.

How many doses of a vaccine could be made by the end of the year is an open question? Pharmaceutical companies have announced partnerships with manufacturing companies as well as plans to begin mass-manufacturing their vaccines before it is known if they work. When the operations are up and running, tens of millions of doses of a vaccine could be produced each month, but getting the specialized equipment, staff and materials needed to produce the vaccines takes time.

At this time, few, if any, viral vaccine experts believe that an effective vaccine will be developed before the first of the year. Politicians are pressuring for a vaccine to be marketable before the end of the year. However, marketing a vaccine which has not undergone sufficient safety and efficacy studies could result in serious long-term effects in the public’s perception of the proficiency of scientific and medical agencies, and they may be hesitant to receive a more safe and effective vaccine developed in the future to prevent COVID19, influenza or other common diseases. Vaccines typically take several years to develop with testing for efficacy and longevity against natural infection being required. Additionally, some viruses can mutate, requiring new vaccines to be developed as currently required for influenza viruses. However, no significant mutations have been noted in the spike protein gene with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Regardless of when an effective vaccine is developed, the first doses will be given to front line individuals, which would include medical personal, EMTs, fire medics, police officers, firemen and military personnel, etc. Next in line would probably be politicians, nursing homes patients and care takers, prisons, people with preexisting health problems and those workers employed in businesses considered essential by federal, state and local governments, such as pharmaceutical, agricultural, food service, banks, gas stations, funeral homes, etc. Vaccines available for the general public in the U.S. and other first-world countries could be given at least three months after these groups. Second- and third-world countries, which lack modern medical infrastructure, could take an additional six months to be vaccinated.

Regardless of when and if effective vaccines are mass produced to vaccinate the world’s population, there will a significant number of people, who, for one reason or another, will refuse to be vaccinated. Therefore, mandatory vaccination cards could be required by various federal, state or local government agencies to be shown to enter schools, planes, mass transit, obtain drivers licenses, entrance into foreign countries or large events with several thousand attendees, etc. The Trump administration has promised that vaccines will be free for all individuals regardless of whether they have medical insurance or can afford to pay for them. In addition, a small economic incentive may contribute to the number of those people willing to be vaccinated in poor neighborhoods, as is currently available for vaccination against influenza.

The term “herd immunity” is often used to determine the percent of population that has develop immunity either in the form of a vaccine or natural infections. Herd immunity occurs when a large portion of a community (the herd) becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. As a result, the whole community becomes protected—not just those who are immune. Often, a percentage of the population must be capable of getting a disease in order for it to spread. This is called a threshold proportion. If the proportion of the population that is immune to the disease is greater than this threshold, the spread of the disease will decline. This is known as the herd immunity threshold. For most diseases 60 percent to 90 percent of the population needs to have immunity to stop the spread on the disease. However, currently no one knows what percent is needed for “herd immunity “against the COVID19 virus.

So far, no vaccine has ever been developed against a human coronavirus. That being said, the most important current procedures, which are needed to prevent the spread of the virus, are continuation of CDC and other medical, research and governmental agencies recommendations. Keep in mind some people may have the COVID-19 virus and spread it to others, even if they don’t have symptoms or don’t know they have COVID-19.

Important viral mitigation procedures are to wash your hands often with soap and water for least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Avoiding large gathering, practicing social distancing and wear a mask in public. Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away the used tissue. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Avoid sharing dishes, glasses, bedding and other household items if you’re sick. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters, daily. Stay home from work, school and public areas if you’re sick, unless you’re going to get medical care. Daily testing of your body temperature is also effective. Use telemedicine if you are sick and need to talk with a doctor and use on-line communications for working at home when possible. Avoid public transportation, taxis and ridesharing if you’re sick.

Currently many people believe that the virus will disappear in hot weather and a second or third wave will not occur, and they want full opening of the economy and life to return to what it was prior to the dawn of the pandemic. Unfortunately, most medical experts do not believe that this scenario has or will occur, and that state and local governments have already rushed too fast to reopen society for economic reasons. The mantra of many people, agencies and companies is that they are tired of COVID19 isolation and will not adhered to important viral mitigation procedures. They believe that the economic pain of isolation is worse than the disease itself. Only time will tell if their beliefs are correct.

Regardless of when and if effective vaccines are developed, more rapid effective testing for the virus and/or antibodies with contact tracing needs to be developed and utilized to avoid the spread of the virus. Another avenue that needs to be addressed is the development of effective in-home antiviral medications, as are currently available for influenza and HIV infections, that will treat symptomatic people and prevent viral spread during a 14-day quarantine. Currently only in-hospital antiviral therapy is effective to reduce the severity of critically ill patients. Antiviral treatments will free up hospitals to treat none COVID19 infected patients. According to Dr. Corey, “A virus that we’ve never seen before is unpredictable … We have to anticipate all options.”

Joseph Giambrone is a professor emeritus in Auburn University’s Department of Poultry Science with a joint appointment in the Department of Pathobiology in the College of Veterinary Medicine. During his graduate research career at the University of Delaware, he was part of a research group that developed the first vaccine against an antigenic variant of an avian coronavirus. During a sabbatical leave during his tenure at Auburn, he was part of a research group in Australia that sequenced the entire genome of antigenic variant of a coronavirus of chickens. During his 42-year research career as a molecular virologist, immunologist and epidemiologist, he has made critical advancements in understanding the ecology of viral pathogens, led efforts to improve detection and surveillance of viral diseases and developed new and effective vaccines and vaccine strategies to protect commercially reared chickens as well as pathogens, such as avian influenza viruses, which have spilled over into human populations. His research has had a profound impact on practices used today to reduce the incidence and severity of viral diseases of commercially reared poultry as well in human populations."

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on Empire, Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

Actress Alyssa Milano won’t even refer to Smollett by name as she is apparently so ticked off by the possibility that he staged last month’s incident in which he claimed he was the victim of a homophobic and racist attack.

Law enforcement sources told TMZ that a grand jury will hear the actor’s case early next week, though there were no details about what the charges are or who is facing them. Smollett claimed he was assaulted in Chicago on Jan. 29 by two men shouting “this is MAGA country” while pouring a liquid on him, and hurling racist and homophobic slurs against him.

But new evidence led police to believe Smollett hired actors to stage the fake attack after arresting and questioning brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, who were released without charges but provided evidence police said shifted the “trajectory of the investigation.”

TMZ reported that the men, who worked as extras on Smollett’s TV series “Empire,” are “staying somewhere around the Loop in downtown Chicago under the watchful eye of police so no one gets to them.”

“We’re told cops especially want to make sure Jussie does not contact the brothers,” the outlet reported.

Magazines with missing pages that police found when they raided the brothers’ homes were being investigated for any connection to a threatening letter that was sent to Smollett about a week before the alleged attack. Smollett refused to press charges against the men after reportedly finding out who they were, saying he felt bad for them, sources told TMZ.

According to TMZ:

The sources say there were red flags from the get-go. Cops were extremely suspicious when Jussie took them out to the area where he said he was attacked and pointed to an obscure camera saying how happy he was that the attack was on video. Turns out the camera was pointing in the wrong direction. Cops thought it was weird he knew the location of that camera. And, there’s this. We’re told investigators didn’t believe the 2 alleged attackers screamed, “This is MAGA country,” because, “Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire.'”

Many liberals bought into Smollett’s narrative when first reported, rushing to condemn right-wing conservatives, anti-LGBTQ critics and even President Trump, for the alleged hate crime. Prominent Democrats and 2020 presidential candidates added their knee-jerk commentary, taking to Twitter to support Smollett and even push an anti-lynching bill, as Sen. Cory Booker did.

Milano also reacted to Smollett’s “trauma” in the hours following the alleged attack.

I’ve been trying to figure out all day what to say about the racist, homophobic, violence against @JussieSmollett. Not sure I can describe what I’m feeling in a neat & tidy tweet. His trauma deserves more. I’m sad. Living together on the planet shouldn’t be this difficult. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) January 30, 2019

But after the evidence of a staged attack mounted in the last few days, the left-wing activist, who recently compared MAGA hats to KKK hoods, sputtered her disbelief on Twitter Sunday.

If that man staged his own attack he is wrong in so many ways. No one could be that hurtful? To stage this? Right? To fuck with all of us by playing into our weaknesses & make it even harder for victims to come forward?! No one could choose to be that hurtful? Right?! RIGHT? — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) February 18, 2019

Though not exactly an apology for her former defense of the actor, Milano’s tweet may be one of many forthcoming admissions by other liberal celebrities and the like. But probably not best to hold your breath.

Smollett, 36, an openly gay African-American performer who plays a gay character on the musical hip-hop TV drama “Empire,” ignited a furor on social media last month when he reported he had been attacked on the street by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett’s account, his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” before fleeing. Police said the actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt.

On Wednesday evening this week, police said they arrested two Nigerian brothers described as “persons of interest” who were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area of the alleged Jan. 29 assault.

The pair were freed two days later without charge, police told Reuters on Friday, in light of “new evidence” from their interrogation.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied a media report on Thursday that detectives were looking into whether Smollett had staged the attack, saying then that there was “no evidence to say this is a hoax.”

On Saturday, Guglielmi issued a brief statement saying that “information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He added, “We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Attorneys for Smollett said in a statement late on Saturday that he was “angered and devastated” by recent reports that the alleged attackers were people he is familiar with, including a personal trainer he hired to prepare him for a music video.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” said the lawyers, Todd Pugh and Jonathan Brayman.

Smollett and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago police department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate, they said.

Meanwhile, the New York Post reported that Smollett has also retained the services of criminal defense lawyer Michael Monico, a former Illinois federal prosecutor who is also representing President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen.

Monico could immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.

“Empire” debuted on the Fox network in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

This is the haunting moment the crazed Tunisian gunman made his escape after slaughtering 38 people.

Seifeddine Rezgui was spotted by a tourist following his 25-minute rampage where he targeted holidaymakers lounging on the beach in Sousse.

The 55-second clip shows the 23-year-old ISIS militant, who was also carrying grenades, dressed in black and running along the edge of the sea.

It emerged as the number of Britons feared to have been killed in the attack rose to 30 on Sunday night.

This is the terrifying moment the Tunisian gunman was filmed making his escape moments after slaughtering 38 people

'WE ARE CERTAIN THE NUMBER WILL GO UP... IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY A LARGE PROPORTION WERE BRITISH': FAMILIES OF MISSING BRITONS IN TUNISIA BRACE THEMSELVES FOR TRAGEDY AS DEATH TOLL IS EXPECTED TO DOUBLE The families of missing Britons in Tunisia who have not been heard from since Friday's attack were preparing for the worst on Sunday as it was claimed the death toll of Brits killed in the massacre would double. The Foreign Office have confirmed at least 15 people killed were British, with the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warning the number would rise 'significantly'. On Sunday as the relatives of the missing arrived in Tunisia, it was claimed at least 30 British lives had been taken in the attack which is the worst on the nation since the 7/7 bombings. The Foreign Office could not confirm the number when contacted on Sunday night but reinforced Mr Hammond's guidance the death toll would increase. Speaking earlier in the day, he said: 'As I understand it a large number were dressed for the beach so they were not carrying ID on them. There’s a process that has to be gone through. 'We have sent special police teams out there and they are working through the remaining non-identified victims. ‘There are a significant number of victims who have not been positively identified and it is highly likely a significant proportion will be British. (At the moment there are) 15 confirmed British nationals dead but we are certain that number will go up as the significant number of unidentified victims are positively identified over the coming hours and days.'

Earlier in the day the Foreign Secretary warned the death toll would rise 'significantly' as the process of identifying victims continued. On Sunday night multiple sources said the number would rise to at least 30.

The Foreign Office could not confirm the figure when contacted, still officially giving the number of Britons killed as 15.

It came after haunting footage of Rezgui wandering along the beach with a Kalashnikov in his hand emerged.

In the footage the killer can be seen still carrying the assault rifle he used in the horrifying attack as he turns to sprint up an alley.

The footage, shot from a nearby balcony, was released after a Tunisian police officer revealed he killed the assassin using 'two bullets'.

The policeman, who wished to keep his identity secret, said he spotted the gunman while he was praying in a side street before he shot him twice.

Following his killing spree, Rezgui stopped outside a housing development belonging to Mayel Moncef, 56.

As bullets rained down on the gunman from rooftop snipers, he dropped to his knees in prayer, allowing a grenade to roll from his hand and into the gutter.

Mr Moncef then picked up a stack of terracotta roof tiles and threw it on the head of the gunman, causing him to stumble. He walked a few yards before the policeman shot him dead.

DALAI LAMA CONDEMNS ISIS ACTS AS 'UNTHINKABLE' AS THE WORLD REELS FROM TUNISIAN BEACH MASSACRE The Dalai Lama made an emotional appeal for peace today as he celebrated his 80th birthday with a rare appearance at Glastonbury. Addressing crowds who had gathered at the Stone Circle, the Tibetan spiritual leader said: ''A lot of problems we are experiencing are our own creations. Violence is being created this very moment in Syria, Iraq and Nigeria. 'Humans killing each other in the name of religious faith. Unthinkable. 'There is nothing wrong with religious beliefs but some supporters of religions have a lack of moral principle and conviction. 'Yes, I'm Buddhist and Asian and I am his holiness the Dalai Lama but we are the same human being.' He added: 'There is no basis to kill. I love my own life. Everyone loves their own life. 'Everyone has the right to live happily. Once you have a firm conviction in that then suddenly man-made problems will reduce.' The Dalai Lama made an emotional appeal for peace today as he celebrated his 80th birthday with a rare appearance at Glastonbury

'I put two bullets in him. I haven't slept since', he told the Sunday People.

Witness accounts say Rezgui was seen laughing and joking among the midday bathers, looking like any other tourist.

But he was actually carefully picking out the victims he would murder with a Kalashnikov hidden in his parasol.

In the murderous rampage on the crowded Tunisian beachfront at El Kantaoui near Sousse, he killed 38 - with 36 seriously wounded.

The British were his prime targets and at least 15 have been confirmed dead with the death toll expected to double.

'One minute you're on a sun lounger then the next there are bullets whizzing past your head', one witness said.

Last night, a Tunisian Interior Ministry source said that while Rezgui did not have a criminal record, he was known to authorities for 'low level radicalism' and was once stopped by police for smoking cannabis.

The source confirmed Rezgui was an active member of a radical group called Islamic Youth and would go to mosques controlled by radical preachers.

By the time he launched his killing spree in Sousse, Rezgui was said to be working with ISIS, which yesterday posted a picture of him with two assault rifles either side of him, on its website.

Using Rezgui's jihadi name, Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani, it described him as 'Our brother, the soldier of the Caliphate'.

Speaking from the family home in Gaafour, a poor area of Tunisia's Saliana province, his uncle Ali Bin Muhammad Rezgui said: 'He was a sweet boy when he was younger. He was a breakdancer and loved football. He should have had a long, happy life.'"

As the Tunisian sun reached its midday peak, and holidaying families laid out their beach towels in readiness for a relaxing afternoon by the sea, Seifeddine Rezgui calmly reached for his AK47 and went on a killing spree which left 39 people dead.

Several brave survivors yesterday gave harrowing accounts of the awful events in Sousse.

Thanks to their stories and reports from local officials it is possible to piece together a minute-by-minute picture of the slaughter:

11.55am: Islamic fanatic Rezgui arrives at the beach, pulling up at speed in an inflatable Zodiac dinghy.

He casually jumps out of the boat and strolls barefoot up the white sand towards hundreds of tourists.

NOON: In dark shorts, T-shirt and necklace, he mingles with holidaymakers.

Hiding a Kalashnikov in a parasol he is carrying, the 23-year-old student appears to select victims, telling some people who don’t look British: ‘You go away.’

12.05: He makes his way to the stretch of beach assigned to the Imperial Marhaba hotel complex, an all-inclusive resort.

British tourist Elli Makin, 22, watches in horror as the gunman takes his AK47 out from beneath the parasol and opens fire.

Some think the first few shots were directed skywards, possibly towards a hot-air balloon or paraglider, but Rezgui quickly turns his attention to the unsuspecting holidaymakers.

Miss Makin, a tennis coach from Ripon, North Yorkshire, said: ‘He dropped the umbrella and pulled a gun. He was just shooting people and they fell to the floor. I saw people dying around me.’

Matthew James, 30 (left, with fiancee Sarea Wilson, 26), threw himself in front of her, taking three bullets and allowing her to escape. He is now being treated in hospital. Owen Richards, 16 (right image, left), saw brother Joel, 19 (far right), killed along with their uncle Adrian

Amid the mayhem, 16-year-old Owen Richards sees his brother, uncle and grandfather killed in front of him.

Mother-of-two Lorna Carty, from Ireland, is killed. She had been snatching a few final moments on the beach as she waited to fly home with her husband Declan who had been on holiday to recover from heart surgery.

As scores of terrified tourists try to find cover, heroic British engineer Matthew James, 30, throws himself in front of fiancee Saera Wilson, 26.

Mr James, from Pontypridd, South Wales, is hit in the shoulder chest and hip.

Miss Wilson said: ‘Matthew put himself in front of me and he was hit, he was shouting and blood was pouring out all over. He just told me to go, to look after our kids and that he loved me.’

Miss Wilson hides in a hotel towel cupboard. Much later she gets the news she had prayed for: Mr James survived. She said: ‘His pelvis was shattered and he suffered a heart attack, but he is alive.’

12.10: The gunman runs from the beach through the pool area of the Imperial Marhaba and into the hotel lobby, firing as he goes.

He seems to know the layout of the hotel well and is able to reload his weapon at will.

At first some tourists think they are hearing fire crackers, but as the true horror of the events unfolding becomes clear, they start to stampede from the beach into hotels, seeking refuge in their rooms.

Many Britons barricade themselves in and try to get messages to loved ones to let them know what is happening.

Amid the confusion, some British tourists are trapped when hotel staff send them fleeing down a dead-end corridor, where the terrorist threw grenades.

Rebecca Smith, 22, from Coventry, said: ‘I was peppered with grenade shrapnel. With one hit, I thought my jaw had come off.’

The office administrator and her boyfriend Ross Thompson, 21, ran for their lives as the gunman hunted down his victims.

Mr Thompson, a fire safety officer, said: ‘We followed the majority of people to the second floor. Staff were saying “Come this way”.

‘But when we got to the end of a corridor it was a dead end. There was no way down but a 30ft drop.

‘We managed to get into a room and barricaded the door. It happened that there were two British ex-military guys with us and they were telling us what to do. We could hear him coming up the stairs. He started firing down the corridor.

Rezgui is pictured advancing through the streets behind the hotel with his weapon raised, moments before police shot him dead

‘We tried to escape from the room but he caught us. There was no way out, we were trapped and then he started lobbing these home-made bombs at us.

‘He was about 20 metres away, he had us trapped and he was shooting at people too.

‘People were running around like flies. There were three people killed. I thought it was game over... I was shot in the toe.’

12.20: The gunman exits the Imperial Marhaba and fires shots into the neighbouring Hotel Rui Bellevue.

The noise of larger explosions joins the sound of near constant gunfire, but as yet it is unclear if they are from grenades carried by the terrorist or by police who are now trying to capture him.

12.25: With armed police in pursuit, the terrorist runs through dusty and potholed back streets between the two hotels.

12.30: Rezgui is cornered and shot dead in a car park at the back of the Imperial Marhaba.

3.00: A man believed to be an accomplice is arrested on a motorway into Sousse.

He is attacked by outraged locals as he is led through town by armed police.

By late afternoon as the sun starts to set, the once-idyllic scene at the beach has been transformed into a major investigation area.

Blood stains dry into the white sand and among the upturned sunloungers lie the bodies of some of the dead."

Machine gun in hand, the ISIS gunman calmly strolls down the Tunisian beach where he gunned down 38 innocent tourists in cold blood.

A truly chilling image shows Seifeddine Rezgui walking through the shallow water in Sousse with his AK47 - casually passing abandoned inflatables as a group of men keep their distance behind him.

The jet ski seen on the left-hand side of the picture could be the one he used to land on the beach, as eyewitnesses claimed.

It is unclear whether the photograph was taken before or after he stained the very sand he walks on with the blood dozens of holiday makers in the popular resort town.

It emerges shortly after the Tunisian Foreign Minister announced at least 15 Britons were killed in the onslaught and that number 'may well rise'. 25 of the 40 people who are being treated for their injuries in hospital are also British.

Massacre: Staff mop up the blood outside the Imperial Marhaba Hotel in Sousse, Tunisia, where at least 38 people were gunned down at a nearby beach in a terrorist attack yesterday

Eyewitnesses described how the maniac shooter also used grenades in the attack as he moved methodically from the beach to the pool - and then into the hotel lobby.

'When he came he tossed a grenade and we saw only black - it was smoky,' said Imen Belfekih, who works for the Imperial Marhaba Hotel where the attack took place.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the massacre which it says was an 'attack upon the nests of fornication, vice and disbelief in God' - before issuing an ominous warning that 'worse is to follow'.

The threat was posted alongside a picture of the man ISIS claim was behind the attack. They named him as Abu Yahya Qayrawani, which is believed to be the nom de guerre of Rezgui, who was shot dead by Tunisian police soon after he laid siege to the beach.

The first Briton to be killed in the attack was today named as Carly Lovett, 24, a fashion blogger from Gainsborough in Lincolnshire. She was on holiday with her fiancee Liam Moore who is known to have survived the attack.

A 16-year-old schoolboy told doctors in Tunisia how a bullet grazed his shoulder before hitting his uncle in the head. Owen Richards' brother Joel, 19, was killed in the massacre along with their uncle Adrian Evans, 49, and their grandfather Charles Evans, 73, who was known as Patrick.

As Owen sprinted away from the slaughter, he didn’t see two other family members die in a hail of bullets. Medics who found Joel said his first words were 'my father's been killed, I need to call my mum'. It is thought that by 'father', he was referring to uncle Adrian, who appears to have been a father-figure to Owen and his brother.

Lorna Carty, a nurse from Ireland, was confirmed as dead yesterday. She had taken her husband on holiday to help him recover from heart surgery.

As around 40 others recover in hospital - 25 of whom are British - thousands of worried tourists have begun to board flights back home to the UK.

British Prime Minister David Cameron has said that the UK now faces a 'severe terrorist threat'. He added there would be 'heightened security' for the high-profile events being held across the country such as the Armed Forces Day parade which took place today.

His announcement came as survivors of the bloody attack began to tell the stories of their miraculous escapes.

A British couple described how they were trapped down a dead-end hotel corridor and came face to face with the bloodthirsty Tunisian terrorist, who began lobbing hand grenades at them

Rebecca Smith, 22, from Coventry, said: 'I was peppered with grenade shrapnel. With one hit, I thought my jaw had come off.'

The office administrator and her boyfriend Ross Thompson, 21, ran for their lives as the gunman hunted down his victims.

It was the bungling staff at the Imperial Marhaba Hotel who sent them down the hallway, as Seifeddine Rezgui was firing his Kalashnikov at terrified holidaymakers.

Mr Thompson, a fire safety officer, who lived through the onslaught said: 'We followed the majority of people to the second floor. Staff were saying ""Come this way"".

'But when we got to the end of a corridor it was a dead end. There was no way down but a 30ft drop. We managed to get into a room and barricaded the door.

Heartbroken: Flowers are placed at the beach next to the Imperial Marhaba Hotel where 38 people were killed yesterday in a terrorist attack

Tears: A woman weeps as she lays flowers where fellow holidaymakers were murdered yesterday

Memorial: One of the heartbreaking notes left at the scene reads: 'Terrorism will not win'

Memorial: People react at the site of a shooting attack on the beach in front of the Riu Imperial Marhaba Hotel, where holidaymakers were gunned down yesterday

'It happened that there were two British ex-military guys with us and they were telling us what to do. It felt like we were in there 45 minutes.

'Then we could hear him coming up the stairs. He started firing down the corridor. We tried to escape but he caught us.

We started firing down the corridor... We tried to escape but he caught us... There was no way out, we were trapped at the end of the corridor, and then he started lobbing these home-made bombs at us Rebecca Smith, survivor

'There was no way out, we were trapped at the end of the corridor, and then he started lobbing these home-made bombs at us.

'He was about 20 metres down the corridor, he had us trapped and he was shooting at people too. People were running around like flies. There were three people killed. I thought it was game over... I was shot in the toe.'

Miss Smith added: 'We got separated. The corridor just exploded and it was chaos. I didn't know if Ross was dead or alive. I locked myself in a staff toilet with a British woman and her 16-year-old son.

'She was terrified because her younger son was alone in their bedroom, and she was texting him to check he was all right.

'We stayed in there for nearly an hour, completely terrified of coming out in case he got us... We heard gunshots but we didn't know if it was him, or the police... We didn't know who to trust. We heard people outside but didn't want to risk it.

Another injured Briton, Matthew James, is fighting for his life after being shot three times in the stomach. He heroically used his own body as a human shield to protect his fiancee Sarah Wilson.

Tunisia's Foreign Minister Tobias Ellwood described the attack on a beach packed with innocent sunbathers as an act of 'evil and brutality'.

He added that the atrocity was 'the most significant terrorist attack on British people' since the July 7 bombings in 2005, which claimed the lives of 52 people in London.

It has been reported that the attack happened on the private beach of the Royal Kenz Hotel, which is situated 400 metres away

Ellwood added: 'Sadly, I can confirm that at least 15 British nationals were killed in yesterday's atrocity but I should stress that the number may well rise as several more have been seriously injured in this horrific attack.'

British police have now flown to the resort to help identify victims and consular teams are in hospitals and hotels looking after those affected, he added.

We are at war against terrorism which represents a serious danger to national unity during this delicate period that the nation is going through Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid

Tunisia's Prime Minister said the Tunisian man who attacked them was not previously known by authorities and came from the town of Gaafour in the governorate of Siliana where he was a student at Kairouan university.

Habib Essid added: 'We are at war against terrorism which represents a serious danger to national unity during this delicate period that the nation is going through.'

Today, he announced a series of new security measures including closing renegade mosques and calling up army reservists in the wake of his country's worst ever terrorist attack.

A second gunman is reported to have escaped, but details remain unclear. Eyewitness accounts say Rezgui was was seen laughing and joking among the midday bathers and sun-seekers, looking like any other tourist.

Eyewitnesses claimed Rezgui was carefully selecting the victims he would murder with a Kalashnikov which was hidden in his parasol.

The British and French were allegedly his prime targets on the crowded Tunisian beachfront at El Kantaoui.

'He was laughing and joking around, like a normal guy,' said one witness. 'He was choosing who to shoot. Some people, he was saying to them ""you go away"". He was choosing tourists, British, French.'

Smollett, who is black, openly gay and a vociferous detractor of Trump’s America, was taken to hospital following an alleged attack by two men. In a surprise reversal, he subsequently turned himself in on charges of filing a false report – but he was later cleared of all changes.

And yet the actor, it has since been confirmed, will not return to Empire. Moreover, he is now facing legal action from his alleged assailants – who turn out to be brothers known to him.

This is how one of the strangest celebrity sagas has unfolded so far.

January 2019

A threatening letter is sent to Smollett at the Empire production offices, which are in Chicago.

January 29

At 2am, Smollett tells the police that he has been attacked by two men, who shouted homophobic and racist abuse at him before putting a rope around his neck and covering him in a chemical substance thought to be bleach. He says he believed the attackers to be white, later adding that the attackers mentioned “MAGA country”, referring to Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan. The incident, Smollett says, took place in East Lower North Water Street in Downtown Chicago."

The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, reportedly told detectives Smollett paid them $3,500 before they left for Nigeria later on Jan. 29, the day the attack was reported.

They were promised an additional $500 upon their return to the United States, sources told CBS Chicago.

The sources said one of the brothers held a rope and poured bleach on Smollett while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett.

Smollett allegedly rehearsed the attack with the brothers on a different occasion before it was staged on Jan. 29. He also gave the brothers money to buy the rope, which was purchased from the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store on Jan. 25, CBS reported. The hat was bought at a beauty supply store.

Sources also told Fox 32 that the brothers told detectives that Smollett paid them for the fake attack. The broadcaster said a receipt found by the police in the brothers’ apartment indicated they bought the rope at Ace Hardware.

According to the Chicago Tribune, the older brother pleaded guilty to aggravated battery in 2012 and was sentenced to two years of probation for being one of five people who stabbed a 17-year-old in 2011. The younger brother was ticketed for driving under the influence in 2015.

The brothers appear to have moved to the United States at different times, with one going to high school here while both attended Quincy University, a small liberal arts college in Illinois. Both owe tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. They filed for bankruptcy in 2016, saying they had a party and decoration store but it was dissolved because it was “operating at a loss.”

Smollett initially claimed that he was attacked at 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two men who were wearing ski masks. He said the men were white and that they yelled “this is MAGA country,” apparently in reference to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”

During an interview with “Good Morning America” last week, Smollett expressed frustration that some people didn’t believe his account.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

The Chicago Police Department said amid the slew of reports that police haven’t found any evidence that the attack happened as described by Smollett but thus far haven’t confirmed the incident “being a hoax.” The spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, has also described Smollett as “the alleged victim.”

One report over the weekend claimed the case could go to a grand jury but a police spokesman told Fox News that Smollett would need to be questioned before he could answer a question regarding the report.

Police said on Feb. 17 that they’re seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett when the new evidence came to light after the brothers were questioned.

“While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete, which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,” Guglielmi said in a statement.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett admitted to knowing one of the Nigerian brothers and his lawyers said he hired the man to help him train for a music video. Another brother has reportedly appeared in “Empire.”

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Among those reacting to the latest developments was Donald Trump Jr., President Trump’s son, who noted that many people who initially issued statements on the attack quietly deleted them, including presidential contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).

In another Twitter post, he added: “It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story.”"

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last monthby two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in their statement.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett’s account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

Last month, Smollett alleged that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime by two men who yelled “This is MAGA Country” after beating him. The incident sparked widespread condemnation and support from senior Democrats and celebrities, including Pelosi.

“The racist, homophobic attack on [Smollett] is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love,” Pelosi had written on January 29th. “I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery [and] that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once [and] for all.”

On Saturday, Chicago police confirmed that the focus of the investigation had “shifted.” CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz reported that authorities believe that “Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault,” adding that the “the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.”

Pelosi was one of many senior Democrat politicians to condemn the attack, with 2020 presidential candidates Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) describing it as an example of a “modern-day lynching.” Others even blamed it on Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.

Unlike Pelosi, neither Booker nor Harris have deleted their tweets, and have so far refused to offer any comment on the case’s latest developments. Meanwhile, Smollett’s attorneys have released a statement this weekend denying their client’s deliberate involvement in the attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” they wrote. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett reported he had been the victim of a “possible racially charged assault and battery” on January 29, Chicago Police said. He received widespread support after talking about what he said happened.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Smollett said he was called “‘Empire f—-t” and “Empire n—-r.”

Smollett also told police the men warned him: “This is MAGA country.”

Last week Chicago Police denied reports they were about to charge Smollett with making a false report.

Two Nigerian brothers were arrested and then released after law enforcement had a chance to review their stories about the alleged January 29th attack.

The tweet that Pelosi removed said the following: “The racist, homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.”

Smollett claimed to law enforcement he went to a local Chicago Subway eatery at 2 a.m., and he was physically assaulted by two men in ski masks who poured a bleach-like substance on him and tied a rope around his neck like a noose. Smollett, who is gay and black, also told police his attackers yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him as well as told him, “This is MAGA country.” Politicians and celebrities alike rallied around Smollett, including Pelosi, who tweeted on January 29, “The racist, homophobic attack on [Smollett] is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love.” However, as the case unfolded over the past two weeks more questions arose as to whether Smollett was telling the complete truth about the January 29 incident.

Pelosi, as well as Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), came out quickly to support Smollett without waiting for facts — and now they have egg on their face.

On January 29, around 2 a.m., Smollett said he was talking to his manager on the phone while walking in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood during the winter vortex.

MORE NEWS: NOLA Protests

That’s when he said two masked men walked up to him, beat him with bleach and hung a rope around his neck, and then walked away claiming, “This is MAGA country.”

After the alleged attack, Smollett returned to his apartment where his manager met him.

They called the police about 40 minutes later.

When law enforcement arrived, reports claim that Smollett had cuts and scrapes on his face and get this, the rope was still around his neck — 40 minutes later.

Smollett said he wanted the police to see what he was attacked with so they could investigate.

“Brian, I remember in the hours right after this happened that — that CNN — that our bosses, were advising to pump the brakes a little bit because there were things already that didn’t add up,” Camerota said on Monday. “I was frankly surprised how many people jumped on board to side with Jussie Smollett before there were photos, before there were police statements, before all that stuff.”

“And so, how do you think this all — what was the trajectory of how this went wrong,” she then asked.

Smollett’s lawyers released a strong denial late Saturday evening, saying he has been “further victimized” by the recent reports.

Smollett reported he had been the victim of a ""possible racially charged assault and battery"" on January 29, Chicago Police said. He received widespread support after talking about what he said happened.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Smollett said he was called ""'Empire f----t"" and ""Empire n----r.""

Smollett also told police the men warned him: ""This is MAGA country.""

Last week Chicago Police denied reports they were about to charge Smollett with making a false report.

And on Sunday speculation that the attack was staged mounted further when Chicago Police sources told CNN that investigators think the actor hired men to attack him.

Smollett has retained attorney Todd Pugh and a new legal team after new evidence surfaced in the case that “shifted the trajectory of the investigation” when two brothers were named as possible co-conspirators who possibly staged the attack at the behest of Smollett.

Pugh told the Sun-Times on Sunday that he and his legal team “expect to [be] back online tomorrow with the investigators and an interview depends on scheduling availability.”

According to CNN, two credible sources tied to law enforcement have come forward to confirm that Chicago Police believe the actor paid two men to assault him.

To further substantiate that claim is the fact that authorities say, “the trajectory of the investigation” into the reported attack had shifted and they wanted to conduct yet another interview with Smollett.

Late Friday, police released two Nigerian brothers they had detained for questioning earlier in the week, without charges. Sources have told CNN that’s because the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Smollett, 36, claimed he was attacked by in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 after he left a Subway restaurant by two masked men shouting racistl and anti-gay slurs, also saying “this is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck like a noose before fleeing. He also claimed they poured some kind of bleach like chemical on him.

“We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with Mr. Smollett [sic],” another police spokesman, Tom Ahern, told the Sun-Times on Sunday.

However, Sunday night Guglielmi said Smollett has not been classified as an “offender.”

Also it was learned that one of the brothers purchased a rope that was allegedly hung around Smollett’s neck at a Crafty Beaver hardware store in Ravenswood, a law enforcement source said.

The police now seem to have made it clear that they believe the brothers at least in part and now have serious questions for Smollett.

This is a developing story."

They felt he has caused damage to the LGBT and African American communities.

Not convinced Smollett was truthful, Project Islamic Hope Director Najee Ali stated that Smollett could put people’s well being and lives at risk. The situation he created is damaging to the LGBT and African American communities and could cause a race war.

Ali added that there are many members of the LGBT and black community who have actually been victims of hate crimes. Smollett claimed he was a victim of a hate crime and racism and they feel he was lying. This action is an injustice to all people who were victims of actual hate crimes and racism.

If indeed Smollett falsified his hate crime attack, Ali believed Smollett should be charged with filing a false police report.

Ali said from outside the police department that if Smollett was lying, he must be brought to justice. Smollett was believed and supported when he first discussed the attack. He was given the benefit of the doubt. However, over the past few days, the lies have been brought to light and continue to unravel.

We're told cops especially want to make sure Jussie does not contact the brothers.

While the Jussie Smollett ""hate crime"" fable continues to unravel, TMZ is reporting that the case will go before a grand jury next week.

We're told when police raided the home of the 2 brothers they found magazines with pages torn out, and authorities are now trying to determine if the missing pages are connected to the threatening letter that was sent to Jussie 8 days before the alleged attack. Our sources say early on they asked Jussie if he'd sign complaints against the 2 men who attacked him and he was clear that he would. But, when he found out the 2 brothers were the ones in custody we're told he said he knew them, felt bad for them and declined to sign the complaints. Our sources say although cops believe the brothers purchased the rope that was around Jussie's neck after the incident, there is no surveillance video at the hardware store because it erases after a week. We're told the way they tracked the 2 brothers down was by their movements in arriving and leaving the scene around Jussie's apartment building. As we reported, they left in either a cab or an Uber, but we're told cops tracked the vehicle and the 2 brothers got out on their way home and into another vehicle. As one source put it, ""It was almost like a bad spy movie."" The sources say there were red flags from the get-go. Cops were extremely suspicious when Jussie took them out to the area where he said he was attacked and pointed to an obscure camera saying how happy he was that the attack was on video. Turns out the camera was pointing in the wrong direction. Cops thought it was weird he knew the location of that camera.

Sequestering a witness before a grand jury hearing is unusual but not unexpected, given the potential for witness tampering by Smollett. But why not just arrest Smollett and charge him?

The explosive political and racial atmosphere in Chicago is so volatile and the police so mistrusted in the black community that the district attorney probably feels it necessary to have a grand jury rather than his office indict Smollett. The burden would then fall on the grand jury, who are not immune to pressure from the black community but, given the evidence already reported, would almost certainly recommend charges against Smollett and the two brothers.

Where before the police were being tight-lipped with the local press about the case, the revelations from the brothers about being paid to stage the attack have loosened a lot of tongues at police headquarters. Care must be taken when evaluating what's being reported, but reporters who have worked the local crime beat for years seem convinced that Jussie Smollett planned and staged a hate crime attack. The motive is unknown. Fox is denying that Smollett was being written out of Empire.

But whatever the reason why Smollett wanted to hoax the country, it surely isn't going to be worth his trouble."

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers.

She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs.

He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

But on Saturday police sad that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges.

Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimised” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

The case will go before a grand jury early next week, according to a new report.

According to TMZ, police sources said a panel will hear the case, but the outlet didn’t elaborate on who is facing charges — or what they might be.

According to the New York Post, Smollett told police he was assaulted in Chicago on January 29 by two men spewing racist and homophobic slurs at him — but his story has since come under fire as sources have alleged to news outlets that he actually paid some friends to stage the whole thing.

Police arrested brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo on Wednesday after they were captured on security footage near the scene — but they were released on Friday without charges, and police then said evidence they gave has shifted the “trajectory of the investigation.”

Police are also now investigating whether magazines with missing pages that they found when raiding the brothers’ homes are connected to a threatening letter sent to Smollett weeks before the attack with cut-out letters reading, “You will die black f–,” according to TMZ.

media_camera Chicago police found Jussie Smollett’s behaviour around the reporting of the crime suspicious. Picture: AP

Smollett originally made it clear to cops that he’d sign complaints against his assailants — but once the Osundairos were arrested, he said he knew them and felt bad for them, and refused to press charges, sources tell TMZ.

Police originally found the star’s story suspect when he brought them to the scene of the incident and pointed out a camera noting the whole attack was caught on video — and were also suspicious of the claim that his assailants shouted, “This is MAGA country,” because “Not a single Trump supporter watches Empire,’” the gossip site reports.

Sources have told CBS Chicago that Smollett paid the bodybuilding brothers $US3500 ($A4893) for the attack — with the promise of another $US500 ($A700) to come — and even purchased the rope the duo allegedly used for the assault.

Smollett denies playing any role in the attack.

His lawyers said in a statement over the weekend that one of the brothers was his personal trainer, and the star finds it “impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

media_camera New documents show that Empire actors Abimbola 'Abel' (left), and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo (right) were bankrupt at one time. Picture: Supplied

Newly unearthed court documents show budding model-actors Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo both filed for bankruptcy in Illinois in September 2016 — with each declaring large students loans and very little income at the time.

Abimbola reported $US161,481 ($A225,758) in debt, including $US85,475 ($A119,498) in student loans, while only making $US160 ($A224) a month — while his brother claimed he had $US72,771 ($A101,737) in liabilities, including $US39,114 ($A54,683) in student loans, and made just $US142 ($A198) a month.

Both reported being part-owners of a party supply store, but said it was operating at a loss.

In a recent hypothesis reported exclusively by the Daily Mail, Smollett allegedly used Instagram to warn the brothers of his location on the night of the alleged incident.

media_camera Smollett posted on Instagram on the night of the alleged assault. Picture: Instagram media_camera Smollett had also been performing in a play featuring incidents similar to those in the alleged attack. Picture: Getty

The Daily Mail alleges that Smollett posted Instagram stories conveying that he was in a plane and stuck on the runway, which investigators believe were signals made to alert the brothers that he would be delayed.

He had also recently appeared in the play Take Me Out, about a bi-racial, gay baseball star who suffers attacks similar to the one he reported to police.

Trudeau also touched upon his decision to take Canada away from a politics of fear, a point he referenced during a lunch hosted by Canada 2020 at the Center for American Progress later that day.

'Diversity is strength,' he said. 'Canadians know this and so do our American friends. Fear is easy, friendship - friendship takes work.'

Trudeau also revealed he and Obama had 'reaffirmed' a commitment to streamlining trade between the two countries, which he noted saw $2.4billion worth of goods and services crossing the border every day.

'Overall, the president and I agree on many things, including of paramount important the direction we want to take our countries in to ensure a clean and prosperous future,' he said during a press conference at the Rose Garden.

Obama then praised the 'great alliance' between the US and Canada.

'Tonight, we want our Canadians friends to feel at home. So this is not a dinner, it’s supper.'

'This visit has been a celebration of the values that we share,' he said.

'We, as a peoples, are committed to the principles of equality and opportunity - the idea that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can make it if you try, no matter what the circumstances of your birth, in both of our countries.'

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in their statement.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett’s account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

When Roberts interviewed Smollett about the alleged attack on GMA last week, the actor said he was “pissed off” by those doubting his story that two supporters of President Donald Trump attacked him late at night in Chicago, hurling racist and homophobic slurs and tying a rope around his neck.

“When I sat down with Jussie it was Tuesday night in Chicago, at the time to give his first account, publicly give his first account of what he said happened,” Roberts said Monday. “And we have to remember, at that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.”

According to multiple reports, police later questioned and released two suspects, brothers both known to Smollett, who said they were paid by the actor to take part in the hoax.

“The police often say something publicly but behind the scenes, Dan, it’s totally different,” Roberts said to ABC chief legal analyst and Mediaite founder Dan Abrams.

“Absolutely,” Abrams replied. “They wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. You don’t want to go out and publicly start questioning someone who talks about a horrific attack like this until you’ve got the goods.”

Sky News host Andrew Bolt says the media blamed President Trump for the incident, and that similar anti-Trump stories have been publicised in the past, that have since proved fake. Mr Bolt says the 'strange' story should be a warning against people pushing stories they want to believe are true, but which they 'cannot know are true'.

Lawyers for Empire actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives for a follow-up interview about his reported assault.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers.

She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs.

He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

But on Saturday police sad that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges.

Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimised” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

The case will go before a grand jury early next week, according to a new report.

According to TMZ, police sources said a panel will hear the case, but the outlet didn’t elaborate on who is facing charges — or what they might be.

According to the New York Post, Smollett told police he was assaulted in Chicago on January 29 by two men spewing racist and homophobic slurs at him — but his story has since come under fire as sources have alleged to news outlets that he actually paid some friends to stage the whole thing.

Police arrested brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo on Wednesday after they were captured on security footage near the scene — but they were released on Friday without charges, and police then said evidence they gave has shifted the “trajectory of the investigation.”

Police are also now investigating whether magazines with missing pages that they found when raiding the brothers’ homes are connected to a threatening letter sent to Smollett weeks before the attack with cut-out letters reading, “You will die black f–,” according to TMZ.

Smollett originally made it clear to cops that he’d sign complaints against his assailants — but once the Osundairos were arrested, he said he knew them and felt bad for them, and refused to press charges, sources tell TMZ.

Police originally found the star’s story suspect when he brought them to the scene of the incident and pointed out a camera noting the whole attack was caught on video — and were also suspicious of the claim that his assailants shouted, “This is MAGA country,” because “Not a single Trump supporter watches Empire,’” the gossip site reports.

Sources have told CBS Chicago that Smollett paid the bodybuilding brothers $US3500 ($A4893) for the attack — with the promise of another $US500 ($A700) to come — and even purchased the rope the duo allegedly used for the assault.

Smollett denies playing any role in the attack.

His lawyers said in a statement over the weekend that one of the brothers was his personal trainer, and the star finds it “impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Newly unearthed court documents show budding model-actors Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo both filed for bankruptcy in Illinois in September 2016 — with each declaring large students loans and very little income at the time.

Abimbola reported $US161,481 ($A225,758) in debt, including $US85,475 ($A119,498) in student loans, while only making $US160 ($A224) a month — while his brother claimed he had $US72,771 ($A101,737) in liabilities, including $US39,114 ($A54,683) in student loans, and made just $US142 ($A198) a month.

Both reported being part-owners of a party supply store, but said it was operating at a loss.

In a recent hypothesis reported exclusively by the Daily Mail, Smollett allegedly used Instagram to warn the brothers of his location on the night of the alleged incident.

The Daily Mail alleges that Smollett posted Instagram stories conveying that he was in a plane and stuck on the runway, which investigators believe were signals made to alert the brothers that he would be delayed.

He had also recently appeared in the play Take Me Out, about a bi-racial, gay baseball star who suffers attacks similar to the one he reported to police.

This was, by all accounts, the smart result for Gareth Southgate and England. So why didn't it feel that way?

Why, when Adnan Januzaj stuck his excellent 51st-minute shot past former Sunderland team-mate Jordan Pickford did it feel a little bit familiar, a little bit here-we-go-again, a little bit like England had missed an opportunity to have a real go against a Belgium reserve team, win the group and keep the feelgood factor going through another summer weekend?

England are now in what has been termed the easy part of the draw. No Brazil in the quarter-finals and no countries considered tournament contenders until Spain loom in the last four.

Handy that. Yet before anyone can start anticipating the last four, even the last eight, there is the little matter of Colombia in the round of 16 on Tuesday, of James Rodriguez injury permitting - in the tournament that made him four years ago, of Radamel Falcao and Juan Cuadrado on missions to remake their reputations in England. Colombia look useful.

Some Colombians have scores to settle. And in finding a way past a dangerous Senegalese team on Thursday, they passed a test far greater than any England have faced so far.

Belgium, meanwhile, go off to play Japan and looked rather happy about that. So what price all that jazz about Roberto Martinez wanting his team to lose? It didn't appear that way on Thursday. Belgium were the better side and could have won by two or three.

They deserved the victory, conjured early in the second half when man of the match Youri Tielemans found the mercurial Januzaj, who bamboozled Danny Rose - if it had been Ashley Young playing, you can imagine what would have been said - before lashing the ball smartly past Pickford.

Belgian celebrations didn't appear false at that moment. Nor did the manner in which they closed the game out. England had one big chance after that, when Jamie Vardy put Marcus Rashford through one-on-one only for Thibaut Courtois to make an excellent save. But Southgate's side still look at their most dangerous from set-pieces.

At times, they also went quite long, too - a worrying and familiar trait when ideas are in short supply.

By contrast, Belgium were outstanding on the counter-attack. Dries Mertens forced a fine save from Pickford on 89 minutes, the excellent Marouane Fellaini found the side-netting in injury time. Their reserves were far stronger than England's.

This is a team that are undoubtedly tournament contenders. They are a different class to Japan and will be a match for Brazil, too.

England's short-term future looks a little less certain.

After two wins against weak teams and a defeat to the first good one they have played - albeit reserves against reserves - Colombia await.

With so much positive momentum coming into this game, it feels like a trick has been missed and many experienced former professionals were saying as much.

Yes, at times in the past few days, it has been hard to work out what constitutes success here. Southgate said he wanted to win, but then left all but two of his best players out. Martinez talked all week as if Belgium would happily slot into second place, then was considerably more ambitious once the game commenced.

Admittedly, Belgium indulged in a lot of keep-ball, cries of 'ole' greeting extended sequences of passing around at the back or in tame areas of midfield.

Seeing substitute Romelu Lukaku happily chatting with Rose as the second half was about to restart summed the game up.

It looked like a World Cup match, but often didn't feel like one. It had the air of a friendly, or one of those end-of-season games between two teams moored in mid-table. If there was a winner, there was a winner, but no-one was going to go to war over it. There are precedents in international tournaments, naturally.

In addition to some famous and scandalous carve-ups, there have been games just like this one in which the two best teams in the group - instead of going at it hammer and tongs in the decider - let events take their course.

In 2006, Holland and Argentina had qualified with a game to spare so, instead of duking it out for group supremacy, played out a 0-0 draw with below-strength sides.

The loss of momentum hardly served either well, mind. Holland went out in the next round to Portugal, Argentina were eliminated by Germany in the quarter-final.

This was the risk Southgate was taking - that, by attempting to give his best players a break from the tournament intensity, he would let the air slip from the balloon. He spoke about the importance of awarding game time, even if it was only a matter of minutes, to every member of his squad and did so, bar the goalkeepers. But this is a World Cup, not school sports day. Everyone is not a winner, everyone does not get a prize.

Yet it is hard to criticise Southgate when Martinez did the same.

Southgate made eight changes to his last starting line-up, Martinez nine. England's starting XI had played 557 minutes so far at this tournament, Belgium's 441. Southgate was giving three players their first taste of this competition, Martinez likewise.

In a possible scare for England, John Stones went off at half-time and had the back of his left calf heavily strapped and iced

Harry Maguire came on for Stones and was soon in the thick of the action as England went in search of the opening goal

When the game kicked off, Southgate had three members of his squad yet to feature in the tournament, two goalkeepers and one outfield player. Martinez, too. When the final whistle blew, only the spare keepers remained unused, for both teams. Southgate wasn't doing anything different to his opposite number, indeed Martinez had announced his plan to make significant changes 24 hours before England played their second group game.

Equally, the need to nurse key individuals through the demands of a tournament was illustrated by John Stones' disappearance at half time, replaced by Harry Maguire. He sat on the bench, strapping on his left leg. It would be mad to take a chance in the circumstances.

England started well and a poor pass was pounced on by Vardy after two minutes, his cross kicked clear by Courtois.

But from that point Belgium were the stronger attacking force. In the sixth minute, Tielemans hit a corking shot from outside the area that seemed to startle Pickford. Soon after, a Fellaini header was close to being turned in by Michy Batshuayi but Pickford smothered it, before losing it, and the ball was cleared off the line by Gary Cahill.

Fellaini continued causing problems. In the 27th minute, his low shot was blocked following a corner from Thorgan Hazard.

England's best chances, as ever, were from set pieces - a Trent Alexander-Arnold corner met at the far post by Cahill, a Ruben Loftus-Cheek header wide from the same source.

There was a lovely, fluid build-up after 14 minutes that saw Phil Jones feed Alexander-Arnold and Vardy glance a header wide, then Rashford curled a shot outside the post after 48 minutes, but Belgium's reserves were better.

By the end, England did not look big or, indeed, clever.

The trajectory of the investigation ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett's attorney to request another interview with him.

A Catholic priest stands over the forlorn figure of a young Nigerian girl, murmuring prayers and sprinkling holy water as she sobs.

Favour*, a 19-year-old, is constantly scratching, her skin is red raw in places. She believes there is a nest of insects living inside her body- and that they will kill her.

The priest is attempting to break a powerful voodoo spell that binds her to her 'madam' in Trieste, near the border with Slovenia, for the next five to eight years.

Exploited: Thousands of women are being trafficked to Europe to become sex slaves, many with the help of African voodoo witchdoctors

Tricked: Their new life in Europe means 10 to 12 hours a day of cars and customers, being forced to exhibit themselves in their underwear and stilettos on the side of the road. If they refuse they face a brutal punishment, with one girl being forced to drink hydrochloric acid

Abuse: Nigerian girls have undergone intimidating ritual performed by witchdoctors, before they are sent abroad. One said: ‘You are tied to them, you are tied to this oath, you are obliged to respect it... hey must command you, control you, and you are obliged to respect it'

Favour, one of thousands of Nigerian women trafficked to Europe to become sex slaves every year, has been told she owes her female pimp €80,000 for her journey. This will take around 4,000 clients each paying as little as €10 or €20 to pay off.

Although the chains tying her to her madam are only psychological, they are extremely powerful.

In their desperation to break the hold over the girls, many of which are sent on the migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean, the Italians have even resorted to get Catholic priests to perform exorcisms on them.

There are estimated to be 25,000 Nigerian girls working as prostitutes in Italy and the numbers arriving rose 300 per cent in 2014, experts say.

Back in Nigeria a witchdoctor had performed a powerful voodoo spell to bring luck for the girl’s journey, she told Italian aid workers.

After leaving her village in the Edo State, with the promise of a job as a hairdresser in Italy, she was taken to a shrine in Benin City.

There, in a terrifying ritual she was made to undress – they cut her pubic hair and toenails and made her swear over the blood of a chicken that she would never betray her benefactor.

Like many others for whom the promised job as a hairdresser did not materialise. Favour believes nevertheless that she has to pay off the debt or face terrible repercussions.

Victim: Lisa*, 17, was on a migrant boat bound for Europe when she was rescued by British warship HMS Bulwark last month. After her father got sick and died, she left Nigeria for Libya before she was locked in a house with four other people, then placed on a boat

Survivor: Lisa didn't know she was in Italy and hadn't paid for her journey, suggesting she had been trafficked to work as a sex slave

Many of the girls have travelled with a lucky charm - a small package that has been prepared and serves as a concrete expression of the agreement.

As well as nail clippings and hair it may contain underwear with remains of menstrual blood. Other common objects are kola nuts,13 bent pieces of metal and soap to symbolise loyalty, the power of the Ogun deity (important for travel) and beauty.

According to urban legend among the women, girls who go back on their symbolic promise become mad, struck dumb or die, one, they say, was found in four pieces on the side of the road.

One girl, Precious, told volunteers that she had a goose’s heart in her throat, which she thought would kill her.

As one former prostitute expresses it: ‘You are tied to them, you are tied to this oath, you are obliged to respect it. And there are those who, I don’t know how to explain it, those who command you because this oath exists. They must command you, control you, and you are obliged to respect it.’

Italian aid workers have found it is useless to tell girls like Favour that the magic, known in Nigeria as jiu-jiu, has no power.

As Francesca de Masi, a sociologist with the Be Free organisation that works with the trafficked women, explains: ‘Telling them that voodoo isn’t real is presumptuous... it doesn’t take into consideration the context they come from.

Safe: Since arriving in Italy she is now in the care of charity Save The Children, and it is hoped she can go to school and get an education

'And it’s counterproductive. It makes them close up and become incommunicative. Whether they believe or not, there are so many reasons to be afraid. The risk that something terrible happens to their family is real.’

Counter-magic in the form of a reverse voodoo with Catholic priests performing a kind of exorcism is more convincing, according to Rosanna Paradiso, founder of the Tampep association in Turin that helps girls free themselves and return home.

‘It’s difficult because the jiujiu has such a strong grip. And the women have been told not to trust police or anyone in Europe. But we have called priests to do counter jiujiu. Occasionally it has been proven to work. I saw one girl who had taken to her bed months before, waiting to die, just got out of bed. She was cured.’

For the other estimated 25,000 Nigerian prostitutes working in Italy the complex combination of blackmail gifts, favours and threats overwhelms the desire to escape their captors. Around 40 per cent of all prostitutes in Italy are Nigerian.

The figure has soared as the ongoing chaos in Libya allows trafficking gangs bringing migrants by boats from Africa free reign.

In 2014 the International Organisation for Migration reported the number of Nigerian girls arriving in Italy had increased by 300 per cent.

Some are pitifully young. Lisa, 17, was rescued by the British warship HMS Bulwark last month.

She was one of several lone Nigerian girls who had not paid money for their journey to Italy and did not know they were in Italy, suggesting they were trafficked.

She said she left after her father got sick and died. ‘I couldn't go to school because I didn't have the money. Somebody that lived nearby said she knew a way for me to go to school.

'This is the only thing I want. So I went with her and I got on a bus to Libya. When I arrived I was locked in a house with four other people. One day there was a raid by the police and everyone ran out.

'It was the middle of the night and I found myself being put onto the boat. I didn't pay any money to get the boat. It was a rubber boat and there was nobody driving it. We drifted for two days with no food or water, then we were rescued.’

Now in the care of Save the Children, it is hoped that she can got to school and avoid the miserable fate of many of her compatriots.

Bewitching: A young girl told Save The Children how a witchdoctor in Nigeria, like these pictured, had undergone a terrifying ritual where she was made to undress, have her pubic hair and toenails cut and swear over the blood of a chicken she wouldn't betray her benefactor

Rejection: Girls that return from Italy to Nigeria are stigmatised while others are forced to submit to 'purification rituals' by tribes

Control: The witchdoctors also give the girls a gift before they travel, often containing nail clippings, hair or underwear with remains of menstrual blood. Other common objects gifted to the vulnerable girls are kola nuts,13 bent pieces of metal and soap to symbolise loyalty

In Turin, which has Italy’s biggest Nigerian population, Paradiso says many women are forced to streetwalk from 10pm to 5am before returning to their homes where they pay rent of €300 a month to live in terrible conditions.

She has seen many cases of girls beaten, tortured with cigarettes or hot irons. Other have told how they forced to drink the water in which the other girls have washed their vaginas as a form of humiliation.

The traffickers first target the girls back in Nigeria, identifying those families where there is not enough to go around, offering them opportunities as a hairdressers or waitresses. Sometimes, the madams themselves fly over to ‘talent scout’ the prettiest.

The International Organisation for Migration say to an increasing extent, the woman or her family must also commit themselves through a written contract using the family home as security for the debt.

If they survive the harrowing journey to Libya through the desert the women are usually sent to a brothel where the realisation that they are not going to Europe to live a more comfortable life first dawns on them.

One told aid workers: ‘I was there (Libya) for four months having to go to bed with an average of five men a day... The tariffs were fixed - one and a half dinar for with condom, two for without. We could not refuse to have unprotected sex. If we did we would be kicked or violently with chains and other objects.

Trapped: After a boat journey to Italy the women are 'easy prey', because they don't know anyone and they are not able to work legally

At risk: Violence in the norm for the women who become prostitutes, and rape and robbery are seen as occupational hazards for workers

'Violence was the norm. Even though I had now understood their terrible intentions it would have been impossible to go back.’ The only possibility was to go on, she said.

Another girl told how she resorted to using wool from inside her mattresses in a bid not to become pregnant.

She said: ‘The madam would open the door, the client would chose a girl to have sex with and she would lock the door with a key. Whoever was not chosen would stay in the room anyway. I was in a room with just one other girl.

'Even though I was using the wool from the mattress as a contraceptive, putting it inside me, I got pregnant’. She was then given ‘medicine’ to cause an abortion, she said.

After a boat journey to Italy the women are easy prey, Paradiso explains. 'They know no one and the asylum system means that they cannot work legally - it creates the means for exploitation'.

Desperate: The number of women being trafficked to Europe for sex work has soared, as the ongoing chaos in Libya allows people smuggling gangs to bring migrants by boats from Africa. An estimated 25,000 Nigerian girls work as prostitutes in Italy

Exodus: While the women are led to believe they will become hairdressers or waitresses when they arrive in Europe from Africa, many are forced into prostitution. Italian authorities are trying to help the women who have been trafficked so they can receive an education

Their new life in Europe means 10-12 hours a day of cars and customers, being forced to exhibit themselves in their underwear and stilettos on the side of the road.

Those that refuse are punished brutally. One girl called Tessie was left deformed after being forced to drink hydrochloric acid, according to reports.

Rape and robbery are seen as an occupational hazard. Although some charities are working with girls to help them return home many feel it is impossible.

As one girl Isoke explained to Be Free, girls that return from Italy are stigmatised. ‘The woman must have money or be rejected by everyone because they all now that she is a prostitute -even if they pretend they don’t’, she said.

While some are marginalised and forced to submit to purification rituals, there are further dangers.

‘Many girls are not only rejected by their families but they also disappear. Some say they are killed. Others say they are threatened and forced to return to Europe.’"

NATO has deployed 31,000 troops and hundreds of tanks and jets to take part in the biggest war game exercise in eastern Europe since the Cold War as it responds to Russian aggression.

The two-week long Anaconda manoeuvres, involving soldiers from 24 NATO and former-Soviet 'Partnership for Peace' states including Ukraine, have been held biannually across Poland since 2006.

Some 1,000 British troops will be joined by 14,000 from the U.S and 12,000 from Poland for the exercises involving around 3,000 vehicles, 105 planes and 12 naval vessels.

At a formal opening of ceremonies in Warsaw, Polish Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz said the games are aimed at 'checking the alliance's ability to defend its eastern flank.'

While U.S Army Chief of Staff Mark Milley explained the American presence 'demonstrates that we are shoulder to shoulder with the Polish people' and that the exercises would 'improve our collective readiness.'

The war games come a month ahead of a 'landmark' NATO summit in Warsaw, which is set to seal the organisation's largest revamp since the Cold War by deploying more troop rotations in eastern European members - who have been spooked by Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

Russia is fiercely opposed to the move, billed by NATO as its 'deter and dialogue' strategy.

While NATO cut all practical cooperation with Moscow following Russia's Ukraine intervention, the U.S-led alliance has said it will hold formal talks with the Kremlin before the July 8-9 summit.

However, just last month Moscow and Washington accused each other of mounting an aggressive military presence in northern Europe as the United States broke ground on a missile shield in NATO allies Poland and Romania.

Russia has vowed to 'end threats' posed by the system, despite U.S assurances that it is intended to ward of potential attacks by so-called 'rogue states' in the Middle East.

The Kremlin said it would set up three new divisions in the west and south of the country by the end of the year to counter NATO forces close to its border.

On Monday Mr Macierewicz said that Polish paramilitary forces will take part in the Anaconda exercises for the first time, as part of Warsaw's strategy to counter 'hybrid warfare'.

According to NATO strategists the tactic is based on deception rather than a formal declaration of war and they suggest Russia has already used it to annex Crimea by covertly deploying unidentified troops.

They also say the same tactic was used to engineer the pro-Moscow revolt in eastern Ukraine that followed.

Around 3,000 vehicles, 105 planes and 12 naval vessels will be used in the exercise involving the 24 NATO states. Pictured, US troops unload their gear at Vilnius airport in Lithuania

Mr Macierewicz said last week that Poland will soon enroll the first volunteers in a 35,000-member paramilitary force aimed at parrying a perceived hybrid threat from Russia.

Warsaw will use these new 'territorial defence forces' to expand its armed forces next year to 150,000 men from the current 100,000.

Russia has long objected to NATO's expansion in its Soviet-era back yard and in 1997 NATO formally agreed not to install permanent bases in former Warsaw Pact states.

In line with the agreement, the Pentagon said in March it would deploy an additional armoured brigade of about 4,200 troops in eastern Europe from early 2017 on a rotational basis - not a permanent base."

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers.

She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs.

He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

But on Saturday police sad that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges.

Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimised” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

The case will go before a grand jury early next week, according to a new report.

According to TMZ, police sources said a panel will hear the case, but the outlet didn’t elaborate on who is facing charges — or what they might be.

According to the New York Post, Smollett told police he was assaulted in Chicago on January 29 by two men spewing racist and homophobic slurs at him — but his story has since come under fire as sources have alleged to news outlets that he actually paid some friends to stage the whole thing.

Police arrested brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo on Wednesday after they were captured on security footage near the scene — but they were released on Friday without charges, and police then said evidence they gave has shifted the “trajectory of the investigation.”

Police are also now investigating whether magazines with missing pages that they found when raiding the brothers’ homes are connected to a threatening letter sent to Smollett weeks before the attack with cut-out letters reading, “You will die black f–,” according to TMZ.

Smollett originally made it clear to cops that he’d sign complaints against his assailants — but once the Osundairos were arrested, he said he knew them and felt bad for them, and refused to press charges, sources tell TMZ.

Police originally found the star’s story suspect when he brought them to the scene of the incident and pointed out a camera noting the whole attack was caught on video — and were also suspicious of the claim that his assailants shouted, “This is MAGA country,” because “Not a single Trump supporter watches Empire,’” the gossip site reports.

Sources have told CBS Chicago that Smollett paid the bodybuilding brothers $US3500 ($A4893) for the attack — with the promise of another $US500 ($A700) to come — and even purchased the rope the duo allegedly used for the assault.

Smollett denies playing any role in the attack.

His lawyers said in a statement over the weekend that one of the brothers was his personal trainer, and the star finds it “impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Newly unearthed court documents show budding model-actors Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo both filed for bankruptcy in Illinois in September 2016 — with each declaring large students loans and very little income at the time.

Abimbola reported $US161,481 ($A225,758) in debt, including $US85,475 ($A119,498) in student loans, while only making $US160 ($A224) a month — while his brother claimed he had $US72,771 ($A101,737) in liabilities, including $US39,114 ($A54,683) in student loans, and made just $US142 ($A198) a month.

Both reported being part-owners of a party supply store, but said it was operating at a loss.

In a recent hypothesis reported exclusively by the Daily Mail, Smollett allegedly used Instagram to warn the brothers of his location on the night of the alleged incident.

The Daily Mail alleges that Smollett posted Instagram stories conveying that he was in a plane and stuck on the runway, which investigators believe were signals made to alert the brothers that he would be delayed.

He had also recently appeared in the play Take Me Out, about a bi-racial, gay baseball star who suffers attacks similar to the one he reported to police.

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question. On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them. One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in their statement.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett’s account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win. He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed. Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on Empire, Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show. Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

Sen. Cory Booker’s declaration that he was withholding judgement would be commendable if he hadn’t already called it out as “an attempted modern-day lynching.” The Democratic presidential candidate told reporters Sunday that he was now waiting until the facts came in on the alleged hate crime against the “Empire” actor, a blatant about-face after joining others like Sen. Kamala Harris and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the left’s bandwagon of condemnation for the alleged racist and homophobic attack Smollett claimed occurred in Chicago last month.

“Well, the information is still coming out, and I’m going to withhold until all the information comes out,” the New Jersey Democrat said, speaking to reporters after meeting with voters in Rochester, N.H. , according to Fox News. “What we’re seeing is attacks on people because they’re different and we all need to join together and condemn those attacks and the hatred and the bigotry that sources them.”

“We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise in a serious way, and we actually even know in this country that since 9/11, the majority of the terrorist attacks on our soil have been right-wing terrorist attacks — the majority of them white supremacist attacks,” Booker claimed.

The Democrat’s sudden cautionary thinking on the Smollett case is a departure from his earlier reaction within hours of Smollett’s claim, condemning the alleged crime while touting an anti-lynching bill introduced in Congress.

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe. To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention. https://t.co/EwXFxl5f2m — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) January 29, 2019

Booker, and many of his Democratic colleagues seemed to have no intentions of “withholding” any judgement after the initial reports, and now are either deleting supportive tweets or remaining noticeably silent.

Weird, I don’t remember @CoryBooker withholding comment until all the information was out when the story first broke…I wonder what possibly could have changed? ??#SmollettHoax https://t.co/Rh7Gn6kNqy — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 17, 2019

After questioning two Nigerian brothers in the reported attack, Chicago police released them and now suspect that Smollett paid them to stage the crime. Now, it seems, many on the left have some backtracking to do after being quick to judge the “facts” in the case. Left-wing activists, celebrities, Democratic political candidates and the media piled on the hate-crime narrative, defending the black and openly gay actor who claimed that the two white men attacked him, shouting “this is MAGA country,” and placed a rope around his neck.

Ocasio-Cortez slammed the “racist and homophobic attack” before any of the solid facts had been investigated.

There is no such thing as “racially charged.” This attack was not “possibly” homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack. If you don’t like what is happening to our country, then work to change it. It is no one’s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes. https://t.co/QAi0IYtSeR — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 30, 2019

California Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris, echoed Booker’s words, calling it an “attempted modern day lynching.”

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters naturally blamed the attack on President Trump, saying “It’s coming from the president of the United States. He’s dog whistling every day.”

“Why all of a sudden do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have picnic while black, and being attacked?” she said.

Outspoken attorney Michael Avenatti appeared to agree with the Democrat’s finger-pointing.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a now-deleted tweet, said, “The racist, homophobic attack on [Smollett] is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love.”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted that the attack was an example of the “surging hostility toward minorities around the country.”

Rep. Eric Swalwell also called out the hate speech.

We start reducing these crimes by rejecting the speech – neither can ever be accepted as normal. — Eric Swalwell (@ericswalwell) January 29, 2019

Hollywood came to the defense of their fellow actor with knee-jerk reactions as well.

I am questioned all the time about what defines toxic masculinity. Look no further than what just happened to @JussieSmollett . Get well brother??? — terry crews (@terrycrews) January 29, 2019

No matter what’s happening around us, @JussieSmollett is ALWAYS quick w/ a massive smile & hug. Thats the kind of man he is. The homophobic, racist hate crime against him & hate crimes against countless others cannot stand. Rebuke hatred any & every time it rears its ugly head. — Gabrielle Union (@itsgabrielleu) January 29, 2019

A) Today I am outraged for my friend @JussieSmollett. He was viciously attacked in my hometown of Chicago. They threw bleach on him and put a noose around his neck. Racism and homophobia are very much alive, people. — Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) January 29, 2019

The sports world echoed the condemnation.

There is no room in our society for hate crimes! People have a right to be who they are and feel safe. Get well soon @JussieSmollett! Respect, love, and support from the Johnson family. — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) January 29, 2019

I’ve met @JussieSmollett a few times at social events and he emanates warmth and joy. I’m just disgusted and appalled that he has suffered the unimaginable. Praying for him and his loved ones. — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) January 29, 2019

Even with all the tweets and comments that have obviously not aged well, it’s highly unlikely any on the left will acknowledge the error of their ways. Instead, like Booker, many will play the game of “withholding” judgement even after they stoke the fires of division with their rhetoric."

Barack Obama received a rock-star welcome in Berlin as he appeared at a public debate Thursday with Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he praised as one of his 'favorite partners' during his presidency.

Obama's trip comes at the same time President Trump is making his inaugural excursion to Europe as president, visiting the European Union and NATO Thursday.

Merkel will leave Obama's side to go visit with NATO leaders in Brussels, including Trump.

Security was tight in front of the German capital's iconic Brandenburg Gate, where Obama and Merkel appeared on a podium before thousands of people attending a gathering marking the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation.

Police helicopters patrolled the skies and snipers with balaclavas watched the scene from nearby rooftops.

After lauding Merkel as someone who had done 'outstanding work,' Obama launched a defense of his own presidency and the values of liberal democracy championed by both leaders.

Citing the rise of nationalism and xenophobia in parts of the world, Obama told the crowd that 'we have to push back against those trends that would violate human rights or suppress democracy or restrict individual freedoms.'

In a veiled reference to his successor Donald Trump, Obama also spoke of the need to see development aid and diplomacy as essential aspects of national security policy.

'We can't isolate ourselves. We can't hide behind a wall,' he said, to cheers from the audience.

Merkel, who has taken political heat for her open door policy on refugees, including from Trump who called it a 'catastrophic mistake,' got reassurance from Obama.

'In the eyes of God, a child on the other side of the border is no less worthy of love and compassion than my own child,' Obama said. 'You can't distinguish between them in terms of their worth or inherent dignity.'

Obama also talked about how leaders also had to be responsible for taking care of their own people, explaining that more needed to be done for people in their own countries so they didn't want to leave.

He also defended his signature health care legislation, the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed 'Obamacare.'

'My hope was that I was able to get 100% of people health care while I was president. We didn't quite achieve that, but we were able to get 20 million people health care who didn't have health care,' Obama said.

'Certainly I have some regrets,' he continued. 'Obviously some of the progress that we made is now in peril ... but the point really is for those 20 million people, their lives have been better.'

Obama also talked generally about his leadership philosophy.

'I often say that in politics or at least what I used to say about the presidency is that I saw myself as a relay runner,' he said. 'I would take the baton and I would run my leg of the race. and then I'd pass along the baton to someone else.'

'And again that's part of the reason why I'm so interested in talking to young people today, because each generation tries to make progress knowing that what we do is not going to be perfect is not going to solve every problem,' Obama added.

Since leaving office in January, Obama has spoken at several public events, which usually center around political discussions with young people.

Merkel, who hosted Obama at the same spot four years ago, was due to travel to Brussels later Thursday for a meeting with leaders of fellow NATO member states, including President Trump.

Trump will also lunch with France's new leader, President Emmanuel Macron, who won over far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.

Thursday's appearance with Obama was criticized by some German opposition politicians as a publicity stunt ahead of September's general election, in which Merkel aims to win a fourth term.

How Obama and Trump ended up in Europe on the same day was a calendar 'quirk,' as CNN put it, with Obama being invited to speak by the German evangelical protestant church a year ago, before Trump was even elected.

'When we agreed to do this, they had not yet set the Trump schedule, we did not in fact know he would be there when we made this decision,' an Obama foundation official told CNN."

During her first international trip as an official adviser to her father, Ivanka Trump was booed when she mentioned the president's name before sharing a warm handshake with Angela Merkel one month after he awkwardly snubbed the German Chancellor.

President Donald Trump's eldest daughter spoke during the Women's 20 Summit in Berlin at the start of a jam-packed one-day tour after being 'directly invited' by Merkel last month.

While Merkel visited the U.S. in March, the president seemingly ignored requests from the press to shake Merkel's hand while the pair were meeting in the Oval Office. He was heavily criticized for not doing so and mocked by man on social media.

However, Ivanka did not follow in her father's footsteps and shared a friendly handshake with Merkel after participating in the panel discussion on women's entrepreneurship alongside Merkel, Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland and IMF chief Christine Lagarde.

While trying to defend her father, the mother-of-three was booed and hissed at by the majority-female audience when she told the room, 'I'm very proud of my father's advocacy' before she said that he's a 'tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive.'

The moderator, WirtschaftsWoche editor-in-chief Miriam Meckel, interrupted Ivanka and said, 'You hear the reaction from the audience, so I need to address one more point. Some attitudes towards women, your father has publicly displayed in former times might leave one questioning whether he's such an empower-er for women. How do you relate to that or are things changing? What's your comment on that?'

'I've certainly heard the criticism from the media and that's been perpetuated,' Ivanka replied.

In addition, Meckel, grilled Ivanka about what exactly her role is her father's administration.

'You're the First Daughter of the United States, and you're also an assistant to the president,' Meckel said.

The First Daughter (second left) did not give a definition as to what her job title entails, but did state that she cared 'very much about empowering women in the workplace'.

Ivanka, who was seated next to Lagarde, replied: 'Certainly not the latter. I'm rather unfamiliar with this role as well...It has been a little under 100 days and it has just been a remarkable and incredible journey.'

The First Daughter did not give a definition as to what her job title entails, but did state that she cared 'very much about empowering women in the workplace'.

She defined her goal as enacting 'incremental positive change. That is my goal. This is very early for me, I'm listening, learning.'

Ivanka also defended her father discussing how he treated her the same as her two brothers.

'As a daughter, I can speak on a very personal level,' Ivanka said. 'I grew up in a house where there was no barriers to what I could accomplish beyond my own perseverance and tenacity. That's not an easy thing to do, he provided that for us. There was no difference.'

She also redited her father's administration for hiring women in important roles.

'The team basically going through the vetting and hiring process -- six out of eight of those people are women,' Ivanka said.

Ivanka is scheduled later Tuesday afternoon to visit the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe.

Much has been made of the visit after Merkel's frosty meeting with Trump in Washington last month where the US President seemingly declined to shake his German counterpart's hand, opting instead for an uneasy joke about wiretapping.

After speaking during the W20, Ivanka then went to the Siemens mechantronic factory to visit the Siemens Technik Akademie. She is pictured right meeting the CEO of Siemens Joe Kaeser, center, and trainee Thomas Jackques, left

Kaeser greeted Ivanka at the facility as he is one of three German business leaders who took part in a discussion event organized by Trump in Washington in March on how companies can better train workers

The Germans are immensely curious about the Ivanka, wondering if she'll be the moderating force she portrays herself to be, or simply a 'loyal accomplice' as German newspaper Berliner Zeitung mused, nicknaming Trump 'First Flusterin' or 'the first whisperer.'

The president's eldest daughter's visit was at the direct invitation of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the White House said, after the two met in Washington in March.

To prepare for the panel discussion, Ivanka spent weeks preparing, diving into McKinsey & Company reports on women in the workforce, Politico reported. She wanted to successfully highlight the role of women in the global economy and talk about the importance of their access to capital.

The First Daughter started her day with a visit to the American embassy in Berlin where she met ambassador Kent Logsdon who was appointed on January 20.

She is set to visit Siemens Technik Akademie, which comes a month after she held a round-table discussion with Merkel on 'Vocational Education and Workforce Development' as 'education and skills training' is 'central to Ivanka and Chancellor Merkel's agenda.'

She is also going to pay her respects at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews in Europe during her Tuesday trip, which comes on the heels of Press Secretary Sean Spicer's Holocaust gaffe.

During Passover earlier this month, Spicer favorably compared Adolf Hitler to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, causing international outcry.

'We didn't use chemical weapons in World War II,' Spicer said.

'You know, you had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons.'

Spicer apologized multiple times, but the gaffe didn't do the Trump administration any favors as acts of anti-Semitism have increased since President Trump has taken power.

But Ivanka, who is herself Jewish, tweeted on Monday: 'Today, we honor the six million Jews whose lives were taken during the Holocaust and pledge - never again.'

CNN reported Monday that anti-Semitic incidents are up 86 percent compared to the same period of time last year.

Ivanka's visit is in honor of, Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, but is also a savvy public relations move for the administration, in the aftermath of the Spicer incident.

Adding a little glitz and glamour to her first solo trip as both First Daughter and an official White House aide, Ivanka will conclude her day with a gala dinner.

Ivanka continues to play an outsized role in her father's administration, compared to her stepmother Melania Trump, who only sporadically dips into DC.

The White House refers to Ivanka as an assistant to her father and the First Daughter, and she is thought to be sharing the role of First Lady with Melania who spends a bulk of her time in New York where her son Barron attends school.

The First Lady was on hand, however, last week played host at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday.

She also accompanied her husband to Walter Reed over the weekend, to award a veteran the Purple Heart.

Ivanka traveled to Berlin with three staffers - Dina Powell, the deputy national security adviser and senior economic counselor, Hope Hicks, a communications adviser who was her father's campaign press secretary and her new chief of staff Julie Radford, according to Politico.

In spite of the uproar caused by her father's well-documented sexist remarks, Ivanka's advocacy for women and girls landed her in the conference, which had been dubbed as an attention-getting outing aimed at building support for investment in women's economic empowerment programs.

Back home, the First Daughter's plan to push for policies that benefit working mothers is getting less of the spotlight.

Ivanka, an unpaid White House adviser, has not yet offered specific legislation or publicly revealed how she plans to move forward with the child care and family leave policies she promoted during her father's campaign.

But a senior administration official says she and others have been working quietly behind the scenes to revise her campaign proposals and build momentum.

In advance of the summit, Ivanka Trump co-authored an op-ed in the Financial Times, calling for more global efforts to invest in women's economic empowerment.

'The evidence is overwhelming that supporting women's economic participation has enormous dividends for families, communities and whole economies,' she wrote with Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank.

The First Daughter has spent the first three months of her father's presidency talking about women's empowerment, often at White House forums and round tables.

On Monday, she joined her father for a conversation with astronauts on the International Space Station and touted a bill the president signed that asks the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to encourage girls to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

'Encouraging women and girls to pursue STEM careers is a major priority for this administration,' Ivanka Trump said.

Her moves toward policy have been far less public.

Ivanka Trump steps out of her Kalorama, Washington D.C home on March 29

She has met privately with lawmakers, including a sit-down with Republican women in February.

Ivanka's challenge is persuading a Republican-led Congress with a plate full of other priorities.

Lawmakers are focused on repealing President Barack Obama's health care law and overhauling the tax code, and lawmakers are less eager to take on a proposal more likely to pique the interest of Democrats.

At Ivanka's urging, Trump's campaign proposed six weeks of leave for mothers - although not fathers - with the government paying wages equivalent to unemployment benefits.

The proposal also included new income tax deductions for child care expenses and a new rebate or tax credit for low-income families.

But the official said the draft child care plan has shifted away from a tax deduction -which critics say would benefit wealthier families."

The incident occurred at a Sam’s Club in Bowling Green, Kentucky on Saturday.

Alleged victim Terry Pierce told police that the suspect, James Phillips, flipped off him and his wife because of their hats before brandishing a .40 caliber, shoving it in Pierce’s face and telling him, “It’s a good day for you to die.”

“I said, ‘Then pull the trigger. Put the gun down and fight me or pull the trigger. Whichever one you want.’ And he backed up and he said it again, he said, ‘It’s a good day for you to die,'” Pierce told 13 News.

Pierce then pursued Phillips as he ran off to the parking lot. Phillips was unable to leave because he had left his mother inside the store. A verbal altercation ensued during which Phillips accused Pierce of assaulting him, a claim that was disproved by surveillance footage.

Although cameras didn’t catch Phillips pulling the gun because he was out of sight, eyewitnesses confirmed that this did indeed happen.

When police arrested Phillips he was in possession of a Glock .40 caliber with a round chambered in his back pocket and two additional magazines in another pocket.

The suspect was arrested for wanton endangerment first degree and is now in the Warren County Regional Jail.

“I have as much right to wear that hat and support my country and my president as he has not to,” said Pierce.

The incident serves as yet another reminder that while the media will breathlessly report claims of violent attacks initiated by Trump supporters, such as the “hate crime” incident against Jussie Smollett which increasingly looks like it may have been staged by Smollett himself, attacks on Trump supporters by leftists are barely covered.

In a related story, a Vans store employee at the Oak Park Mall in Overland Park, Kansas, lost his job after yelling “f**k you” at a 14-year-old boy wearing a MAGA hat who entered the store with his family.

TMZ also reports that the apartment of the two Nigerians which was searched by the cops had some suspicious evidence like torn magazine pages which is been suspected to have been used to send the threat notes to Jussie Smollett.

Sources close to TMZ says the police believes the brothers purchased the rope that was around Jussie’s neck after the incident, there is no surveillance video at the hardware store because it erases after a week.

Attorneys for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett issued a statement Saturday denying that he orchestrated his Jan. 29 assault, and saying he is “angered” and “devastated” by recent developments in the case.

Chicago police want to interview Smollett, after learning new evidence from two Nigerian brothers who were released on Friday night. Local media outlets have reported that the brothers admitted to police that Smollett paid them to carry out the attack. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi issued a statement earlier Saturday saying that the new evidence “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Smollett’s attorneys denied that he was involved, saying “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that two men had attacked him, poured bleach on him, put a rope around his neck, and used racial and homophobic slurs. Police scoured hundreds of hours of surveillance video in search of clues in the case, eventually tracking down the two brothers on Wednesday night.

In the statement, Smollett’s attorneys say that one of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” said the attorneys, Victor P. Henderson and Todd S. Pugh.

The lawyers said that Smollett is “the victim of a hate crime,” and will continue to cooperate with investigators.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” the attorneys said.

The full statement:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

""Empire,"" Fox's drama about a family-run hip-hop label, has always been defined by its bizarre plot twists. The show has featured a ghost who haunts her living husband, a child whose stepfather is also his grandfather and an amnesia-inducing car bomb. But the latest real-world twist involving a member of its cast is the strangest - and saddest - yet. On January 29, Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon, the openly gay heir to the show's hip-hop record label throne, was allegedly attacked in a baroque hate crime. He told police that his attackers immediately identified him as a gay actor from ""Empire,"" then proceeded to yell racial and homophobic slurs, shout ""this is MAGA country,"" pour an unknown chemical on him and place a noose around his neck. The story has since become even more complicated: The Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers, one of whom said that he played a small part on ""Empire,"" about their possible role in the attack. As of this writing, the department is seeking to interview Smollett again; he has hired a criminal defence attorney. But even before these latest details emerged, when I first heard of the attack on Smollett, I had to pause. On ""Empire,"" Jamal Lyon came out as gay in front of his homophobic, abusive father; took a bullet for that same father and overcame an addiction to pain pills. Was I reading last week's episode recap, or did this actually happen in my hometown of Chicago? Almost immediately, I had a terrible feeling that I was victim blaming, or worse, that I am so brainwashed that I no longer can hear cries of hurt and outrage from my own black community. It was a horrifying feeling that I am still trying to work through almost three weeks later. I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did. I know that there is a deep, dark racist history in Chicago and, if proved true, this would be just one more point on the list. I wanted to believe him with every fiber of my being, most of all because the consequences if he were lying were almost too awful to contemplate. And yet I struggled with Smollett's story.

I tried telling myself that it is possible that two assailants were walking around downtown Chicago at 2 a.m. in January in 10-degree weather, waiting for a black victim. In addition to that, they were stalking around with a bottle of bleach and a rope. And ultimately, the prey they selected was an actor on a show that they must've been somewhat familiar with, because they were able to not only name the show but also know that he played a gay character. Never mind the fact that he was likely bundled up because again: Chicago, January, 10 degrees. Also, after he fought to get away, he left the rope around his neck until he got to the hospital.

Perhaps I don't want to believe him because this is a stark and scary reminder of the poor condition of the country (and city) that I call home. Maybe this story makes the boogeyman in my nightmares all too real, too close and too calculating. Maybe it's because while I consider myself an ally to the LGBTQ community, I still don't understand and appreciate the daily harassment that they endure. Or maybe even though I am a black woman, I still don't know what it's like to be a black man in America.

Over the past few hours, there have been speculations that have confirmed my worst fears. Unnamed ""police sources"" have claimed that Smollett orchestrated the entire thing.

If Smollett's story is found to be untrue, it will cause irreparable damage to the communities most affected. Smollett would be the first example skeptics cite when they say we should be dubious of victims who step forward to share their experiences of racist hate crimes or sexual violence. The incident would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists. It would be the very embodiment of ""fake news.""

And that reason, more than any other, is why I need this story to be true, despite its ugliness and despite what it would say about the danger of the world I live in. The damage done would be too deep and long-lasting. This could be one tragedy that the Lyon family - and more importantly, the ordinary people who loved the show and invested in Smollett and his character - could never overcome.

This time, a Tennessee man named James Phillips was arrested after admitting that he pulled a gun on a couple after getting triggered by their MAGA hats.

The victim, Terry Pierce, told WBKO that Phillips pointed a gun in his face at a Sam’s Club in Kentucky and threatened to kill him.

‘It’s a Good Day For You to Die’

Pierce says he was shopping with his wife when Phillips “pulled a .40 caliber out and stuck it in my face, backed up and said, ‘It’s a good day for you to die.'”

Phillips then ran off. Pierce followed him outside into the parking the lot. Phillips was unable to make a quick getaway because he had to wait for his mom, who was still shopping inside:

“I went out the front of the store to confront him again, and that’s when I got him in his car. He couldn’t leave because his mother was still in the store. And we were having a verbal altercation outside. He tried telling me that I assaulted him and I said, ‘I never touched you.'”

MAGA Hat Triggered Assailant

According to the police report, James Phillips admitted that he flipped off Terry Pierce and his wife after getting enraged at the sight of their MAGA hats.

He claimed that he pulled the gun because Pierce had tried to physically assault him, but surveillance video shows that Pierce never touched him.

Phillips has a concealed carry permit in his home state of Tennessee. He has been charged with first-degree wanton endangerment, a class D felony.

Violence Against Trump Supporters Ramps Up

While the incident might sound funny because no one was hurt, it’s yet another example of the alarming trend of leftists resorting to threats and violence against Trump supporters.

These incidents of harassment and bullying are becoming all too common and must be deterred before someone actually gets killed over a MAGA hat.

In July 2018, a man named Kino Jimenez attacked 16-year-old Hunter Richard and stole his MAGA hat on the Fourth of July.

The shocking incident was captured on video, which showed Jimenez throwing a cup of iced soda at Hunter while yelling: “You ain’t supporting sh*t, n**ger! You b*[email protected] motherf*cker!”

In December 2018, a Trump-hating employee at a Georgia vape shop launched a profanity-laced tirade at a customer and refused to serve him simply because he wore a MAGA hat.

Ironically, the vape shop’s boss — a black woman — fired the verbally abusive employee, saying all her customers deserve respect, regardless of their political affiliation.

Actor Staged Fake Crime to Smear Trump Supporters

In the latest iteration of Trump Derangement Syndrome, “Empire” star Jussie Smollett reportedly hired two brothers to stage a fake hate crime, which he blamed on white Trump supporters in MAGA hats.

When questioned, the Nigerian brothers told police that Smollett had paid them $3,500 to stage the hoax attack.

Smollett ― whose Twitter feed is filled with anti-Trump hatred dating back to 2011 ― apparently wanted promote an anti-Trump narrative, which the media eagerly promoted.

Smollett could now be charged with a crime for allegedly filing a false police report.

Chicago Police Seek Follow-Up Interview With Jussie Smollett

CHICAGO—Chicago police said Sunday, Feb. 17, they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor.

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday, Feb. 15, without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

Smollett, who is black, and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

A CNN article indicates police sources have come to believe Smollett paid the two men to stage the attack. A source also told CNN that police traced the purchase of the rope found around Smollett’s neck to a purchase made by one of the arrested brothers at a Chicago hardware store.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in their statement.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett’s account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Interviewer Robin Roberts brings up that people supported him earlier, but now have doubts as time has passed.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, in which he said he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

When asked why he feels he was targeted, Smollett said it is because he speaks out against President Trump. But Roberts reminds him that President Trump said, “I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned” when asked about Smollett’s alleged attack. A clip of that response is included in the interview video.

“It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,” tweeted Donald Trump Jr., as the idea that Smollett manufactured the incident started to spread.

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

Law enforcement sources told the news outlet — which initially reported the alleged attack against Smollett, which law enforcement sources now say may have been orchestrated — that a grand jury could hear the case next week.

Law enforcement sources connected to the investigation told TMZ that the two brothers who were arrested and then released without charges last week, Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, are staying somewhere in downtown Chicago under police protection. The effort is reportedly an attempt to ensure they don't come in contact with Smollett.

TMZ reports that police found magazines with pages missing when they raided the home of the two brothers; authorities are reportedly attempting to determine if the missing pages are connected to the threatening letter sent to Smollett eight days before the alleged attack on Jan. 29.

The outlet also reports that although the Empire actor initially said he would sign complaints against the two men who attacked him, he reportedly changed his mind and said he knew them when he learned of their identities.

Police are reportedly interested in interviewing Smollett again about the alleged attack, which Smollett claimed involved two men jumping him, shouting racial and homophobic slurs at him, pouring a substance that may have been bleach on him, and tying a rope around his neck. Police reportedly believe the rope was purchased at a hardware store where the surveillance footage erases after a week.

Law enforcement sources told local news outlets the brothers told detectives that Smollett paid them to take part in the alleged attack and brought the rope found around the actor's neck. They reportedly said they were paid $3,500 before they left for Nigeria on the day of the attack and were promised $500 once they returned to Chicago. They also reportedly said they rehearsed the attack ""days"" before it happened.

A law enforcement source also reportedly told TMZ that investigators were suspicious of Smollett's account that the men screamed ""This is MAGA country"" because ""not a single Trump supporter watches Empire.""

Smollett's legal team still says that Smollett is the victim in the situation, arguing that he did not play a ""role in his own attack.""

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

The attorneys said one of the men interviewed by police is a personal trainer hired to get Smollett ready ""physically for a music video.""

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,"" the statement read.

Smollett called rumors that the alleged attack was a hoax ""offensive.""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" Smollett said last week on Good Morning America. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now."""

Listen to the show:

Actor Jussie Smollett was the victim of a horrible hate crime, but it’s looking more and more like that crime might have been a desperate cry for favorable media attention.

Reports out of the Chicago police department indicate two brothers from Nigeria (who were also extras on Smollett’s show, “Empire”) may have been paid by Smollett to perpetrate the “attack” in sub-zero temperatures the actor tried to pin on the president and his supporters.

Nothing adds up, and the story has changed. Now, police are looking into the prospect that all of it was a publicity stunt. Democrats are finding themselves having to back away from a story they immediately embraced because they could blame it on the president; now, they may have to blame it on the victim-fetish they’ve helped create on the Left.

Fired deputy director of the FBI Andy McCabe appeared on “60 Minutes” yesterday, and the biggest story we were sold about the interview — the attempted push by unelected bureaucrats to remove the president from office through the 25th Amendment — turned out to be a nothingburger.

McCabe downplayed what CBS had hyped, to the point that he said he couldn’t even remember how the subject came up.

Former Vice-President Joe Biden is embarrassed by the country for things that happened under the Obama administration; he and the media pretend they had nothing to do with any of it. And the “Morning Joe” crew is worried Democrats might be following Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to defeat. Might the shine be coming off this media-created darling?

On Monday, Bennett College, in Greensboro, N.C., will argue its case for maintaining its accreditation at a hearing before the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, or SACS.

Bennett has been on probation for two years due to financial instability — SACS does not offer a third year of probation, so Bennett’s hearing will either result in its probation being lifted, or the loss of its accreditation. Revocation would cut off Bennett’s access to federal funds, which would all but certainly close the school.

Representatives for Bennett plan to argue at the hearing that the school has secured the funds necessary to maintain its accreditation, its president, Phyllis Worthy Dawkins, told Michel Martin in an interview for NPR’s All Things Considered.

In December, SACS voted to strip Bennett of its accreditation because the school failed to demonstrate “sound financial resources” and a “stable financial base to support the mission of the institution and the scope of its programs and services.” Bennett appealed the decision.

“We were only called on one standard … and that standard is on financial resources,” Dawkins said. “They did not question the quality of our academic programs, the credentials of our faculty and staff, or the leadership on our campus.”

In response to the SACS decision, Bennett launched a fundraising campaign aimed at raising $5 million. A #StandWithBennett campaign went viral on social media, thanks in part, Dawkins said, to support from celebrities like Jussie Smollett and his family. Donations soon began to pour in.

“[W]e’ve raised at least … over $8.2 million that we announced on February 4th,” Dawkins said. Since then, the total has risen to $8.7 million, she said.

Dawkins is depending on this appeal to overturn the agency’s decision.

“We will win this appeal. We will remain accredited, as we are accredited right now,” Dawkins explains.

But if their revocation is sustained, there is a contingency plan. Dawkins said the college is working to secure accreditation from a second body, the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools. The association is smaller than SACS, but is recognized by the Department of Education — meaning the college would still be eligible for federal funding.

Bennett College’s financial woes aren’t dissimilar to those faced by other historically black colleges and universities, which are notoriously underfunded. In December, Saint Augustine University, just 80 miles east in Raleigh, was removed from probation after demonstrating to SACS that it had addressed its financial concerns.

Bennett is now hoping for a similar successful outcome in order to preserve one of the nation’s seminal institutions in educating black women. Dawkins understands this.

“Women’s institutions, HBCUs, need to continue to thrive and survive into the future,” she said."

(TNS)

CHICAGO — Chicago police are investigating whether “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett paid two brothers to stage an attack on the actor in the Streeterville neighborhood late last month, according to a law enforcement source.

Detectives are following up on information provided by the brothers while they were in custody for two days last week, the source said.

Investigators also have been given new details about the rope that Smollett said was made into a noose and placed around his neck as he walked toward his apartment in the 300 block of East North Water Street, the source said.

Detectives had been searching area retailers to find the source of the rope but the new information allowed them to narrow their search and find where it was sold, the source said.

The brothers, 25 and 27, were released without charges late Friday, 12 hours after police had called them “possible suspects.”

Detectives still need to verify their stories and the investigation was continuing. Chicago police announced Saturday that investigators hope to interview Smollett soon.

The actor issued a strongly worded statement late Saturday insisting the attack happened.

“Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” read the statement from his attorneys. “He has been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth.”

The statement said one of the brothers was Smollett’s personal trainer, the first time he has acknowledged knowing either of them. The two also reportedly worked with Smollett on “Empire.”

A representative for the Fox network, which produces and airs the show, had no comment.

Efforts to reach the brothers were unsuccessful."

Jussie Smollett says he was assaulted because of his criticisms of Trump Read more

The police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi’s statement that the inquiry had “shifted” came as questions mounted about the actor and singer’s allegations, according to the Associated Press.

Smollett, who is black and gay, alleged two masked men put a rope around his neck and threw a chemical on him shortly after he went to a Subway restaurant early on 29 January. In addition to hurling racist and homophobic slurs, he said, the alleged attackers shouted a pro-Trump slogan: “This is Maga country!”

In an interview with ABC’s Good Morning America broadcast last Thursday, he quoted the slurs. “There’s no which way you cut it,” he said. “I don’t need some Maga [Make America Great Again] hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

Asked why he thought he was targeted, he referred to Donald Trump.

“I come really, really hard against 45,” he said, referring to Trump’s position as the 45th president. “I come really, really hard against his administration and I don’t hold my tongue.”

Police looked for but could not find surveillance footage of the alleged attack. They did get photos of two men and said they wanted to question them. The men, who are brothers, were picked up last Wednesday at O’Hare airport, on their return from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and raided their apartment but they were released on Friday night without being charged.

“Case update,” Guglielmi tweeted. “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

Citing anonymous sources, CBS’s Chicago affiliate reported that Smollett allegedly paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the assault. The men claimed the actor told them to buy the rope and that he paid for it, the report said. Smollett and the men even rehearsed the incident, the men allegedly told police.

On Sunday, Guglielmi tweeted: “While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

That comment marked a departure from a 14 February statement in which Guglielmi said: “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted ABC7 Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

On Monday, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s attorneys said in an emailed statement the lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf”.

In a statement reported on Saturday night, two of Smollett’s attorneys rejected reports the attack was a hoax.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh said.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Reached by the Guardian via email on Monday morning, Smollett’s recently hired criminal lawyer, Michael Monico, said he could not comment. Other attorneys for Smollett did not immediately respond to requests for information. Guglielmi said there was no new update to give.

Jussie Smollett attorneys dismiss reports of involvement in own 'attack' Read more

According to reports, one of the brothers worked as an extra on Empire. The police search of their apartment turned up items such as an “Empire script” and bleach, as well as a “black face-mask hat” and red hat, CBS Chicago reported. Photos from the search revealed that the brothers’s front door was broken off of its frame, and that bedroom doors were damaged. The pictures also showed that clothes and items in their living room were thrown about.

The brothers’s lawyer has maintained their innocence, CBS reported.

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, said. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

After the brothers were released, Schmidt declined to offer specifics about information they might have given authorities.

“Obviously I had it,” Schmidt said, according to the Chicago Tribune. “Obviously my clients had it. But I think it took a matter of coordination.”

Asked if Smollett staged the incident, she said: “There’s still a lot of moving parts to this … I’m not part of Jussie’s defense. I’m not part of what’s going on with him. I can just tell you that my guys [are] innocent of the charge and they’re going home.”"

A Royal Navy submarine was hunted by Russian warships in a 'cat and mouse' pursuit under the eastern Mediterranean shortly before the UK took part in airstrikes against the Assad regime in Syria, it has emerged.

Russian hunter-killer submarines, nicknamed 'Black Hole' because of their stealth, chased the British Astute-class submarines over several days, supported by two frigates and an anti-submarine aircraft, according to a military source.

UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said today that the UK would have to take 'precautions' against Russian cyber-attacks, after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of 'consequences' following the airstrikes by the UK, US and France in which suspected chemical weapons sites in Syria were reduced to rubble.

The Russian Kilo-class submarines tracked the British crew as the UK vessel, carrying Tomahawk missiles with a range of up to 1,000 miles, moved within firing distance of Syria, The Sunday Times reports.

No British submarines were in fact used in the strikes, though the British boat would have been carrying up to 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles. The US Navy was also flying patrol aircraft over the area to track Russian boats and protect its ally Britain

No missiles were in fact fired from British submarines during the strikes, although though the British boat would have been carrying up to 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles. The US Navy was also flying patrol aircraft over the area to track Russian boats and protect its allied submarines, it is reported.

Britain's nuclear-powered Astute submarines cost around £1.2billion each and have been commissioned since 2010, while the Russian Kilo-class submarines are powered by diesel generators and can reach a top speed of 20 knots.

Nick Childs of the International Institute for Strategic Studies said submarine commanders were trained not to fire too many missiles at once as they would give away their position.

It comes after new satellite imagery revealed extensive damage to targets hit by the airstrikes in Syria, where three sites were destroyed as Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron responded to a chemical attack by the Assad regime which killed 75 people.

Trump has vowed to carry out further airstrikes on Syria if the regime dares to use chemical weapons again, while UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson defended Britain's decision to stand up to 'barbarism' amid criticism of Mrs May for acting without a vote in the House of Commons.

America's UN ambassador Nikki Haley said today the U.S. will be imposing more economic sanctions on Russia for its support of Assad, saying they will affect companies that are 'dealing with equipment related to Assad and any chemical weapons use'.

Assad continues to deny using chemical weapons, telling visiting Russian politicians today that Western air strikes against his country were accompanied by a campaign of 'lies' and misinformation at the UN.

Putin told Iranian President Hassan Rouhani today that more airstrikes would be in violation of the United Nations Charter and 'would inevitably provoke chaos in international relations', according to the Kremlin.

Images taken on Saturday show extensive missile damage to the facilities believed to be involved with Syria's chemical weapons program, with two facilities decimated in Homs and the Bazrah Research Center, a scientific research center on the outskirts of Damascus, also hit by a barrage of missiles.

Warning of 'consequences', Putin described the airstrikes as 'act of aggression' that would 'worsen the humanitarian catastrophe' in Syria and have a 'destructive influence on the entire system of international relations'.

Boris Johnson said failure to respond to Assad's use of illegal chemical weapons against his own people would have undermined 'civilised values'.

He said 'so far, thank heavens, the Assad regime has not been so foolish to launch another chemical weapons attack,' adding that Britain and its allies 'would study what the options were' in the event of another attack.

But amid fears of revenge attacks by Russia and criticism of Theresa May for acting without a Commons vote, Mr Johnson stressed there was no intention of getting more deeply involved in the Syrian civil war.

Concerns have been raised that a cyber backlash could see vital services including water supplies, gas networks, banks, hospitals and air traffic control affected.

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show today, Mr Johnson said: 'You have to take every possible precaution, and when you look at what Russia has done, not just in this country, in Salisbury, attacks on TV stations, on the democratic processes, on critical national infrastructure – of course we have to be very, very cautious indeed.'

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the UK's air strikes 'legally questionable', forcing the Government to publish detailed legal advice justifying the bombings. Today Mr Corbyn demanded a 'war powers' law to ban the Prime Minister from taking military action without a Commons vote.

‹ Slide me › One of two targets hit at the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons Storage site was the storage site (pictured) which was hit at the same time by 22 missiles. The astonishing images show what appears to be the main buildings reduced to rubble

The official legal advice claimed 'the UK is permitted under international law, on an exceptional basis, to take measures in order to alleviate overwhelming humanitarian suffering'. Mrs May will face MPs tomorrow.

Asked if there were any circumstances in which he would back air strikes in Syria, Mr Corbyn replied: 'I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it.

'If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. 'That surely would save a lot of lives,' he told the Andrew Marr Show.

Meanwhile protests broke out today at the entrance gate of a British air base in Cyprus to denounce US-led airstrikes against the Assad regime in Syria.

Around 350 demonstrators, from communist organisations in Greece and Cyprus, gathered in front of RAF Akrotiri where four Tornado warplanes took off to take part in the missile strike. Protest leader Akis Poullos said they were demanding the closure of RAF Akrotiri, with signs condemning the 'NATO killers' after the attack.

Putin criticised Washington and its allies for attacking without waiting for inspectors from the international chemical weapons watchdog group to visit Douma, just outside Damascus, saying Russian military experts had found no trace of the attack.

‹ Slide me › Barzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack. A total of 76 missiles pummeled this site alone. Smoke still lingered well after the attack that happened in the early morning darkness of 4am

A Russian motion in the UN Security Council to condemn the airstrikes was rejected with only China and Bolivia joining Russia to vote in favour, as U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley promised the country was ready for another strike if Assad crossed the chemical weapons 'red line' in the future.

Moscow's ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said: 'A pre-designed scenario is being implemented. Again, we are being threatened. We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences. All responsibility for them rests with Washington, London and Paris.'

Scores of fast jets, fighters and destroyers fired more than 100 missiles at three military targets in Syria on Friday night in retaliation for President Assad's chemical weapons attack on the rebel enclave of Douma on April 7.

Some 75 people, including children, are said to have died when the Syrian regime used chlorine gas and another nerve agent in Douma last Saturday.

Aid workers told how chlorine could be smelled in the air and victims were found with foam in their mouth and with burning eyes.

Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter's Square that he is `'deeply disturbed' by the international community's failure to come up with a common response to the crisis in Syria and other parts of the world.

'Despite the tools available to the international community, it is difficult to agree on a common action toward peace in Syria or other regions of the world,' the Pope told a crowd of 30,000 after his traditional Sunday blessing.

The Pentagon shared details early on Saturday of the successful, coordinated missile attack on Damascus which set the Syrian regime's chemical weapons program back 'years'.

At a press conference in Washington DC on Saturday morning, Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie gave a detailed break-down of the 105 missiles launched, saying: 'This is going to set the program back for years. We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.'

He also rejected the Syrian media's claim that Assad's missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over. Russia also claimed missiles had been intercepted.

The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Center which was considered to be the 'heart' of the regime's chemical weapons program.

The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by 22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles. The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.

Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities. On Saturday, the General said that if any deaths are reported they may well have been the result of Assad's counter fire.

'Syria shot 40 large missiles into the air using ballistic trajectory, without guidance. When we shoot iron into the air without guidance, it's going to come down somewhere,' he said.

All of the US aircraft returned safely to base after the attack. Gen. McKenzie did not say where the Lancer B-1 Bombers had flown from but other officials suggested they were deployed from an airbase in Qatar.

'We met our objective. We hit our target. It was mission accomplished,' a Pentagon spokesperson said on Saturday, repeating President Trump's tweet earlier in the day.

Hours after Trump hailed the missile strike targeting the Syria's suspected chemical weapons - tweeting, 'Mission Accomplished!' - Vice President Mike Pence defended the president while building support among U.S. allies for the joint strikes with Britain and France on Saturday.

'The objective of the mission the commander in chief gave our military forces and our allies was completely accomplished - with swift professionalism,' Pence told reporters, noting there were 'no reported civilian casualties.'

He also had a warning for Russia: 'Our message to Russia is, 'you're on the wrong side of history,' ' Pence also said. 'It's time for Russia to get the message President Trump delivered last night. 'You're known by the company you keep.'

Russia has military forces, including air defences, in several areas of Syria to support President Assad in his long war against anti-government rebels.

Confusion arose over the extent to which Washington warned Moscow in advance. The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, 'Before we took action, the United States communicated with' Russia to 'reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.'

A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.

France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, hours before the Western missile strikes.

Between the jets and warships, 76 missiles annihilated the Barzah research center. Fifty-seven of those were Tomahawk missiles and 19 were Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles.

The Tomahawks were mostly fired from the USS Monterey, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser and the USS Higgins, USS Laboon and the USS John Warner submarine.

France deployed its Mirage and Dassault Rafale jets and reportedly used four frigate warships. It is not clear how many aircraft were deployed. Britain is believed only to have fired missiles from its Torpedoes and Typhoon aircraft.

Other ships from each nation's military were in the region, including the USS Donald Cook, but did not fire any weapons. Despite the attack, Pentagon spokesperson Dana White said the US was still committed to a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the ongoing civil war in Syria.

'Our goal has not changed. Our goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS....but Assad's actions were beyond the pale. We do not seek conflict in Syria but we cannot allow such grievous violations of international law,' she said.

'We will not stand by passively while Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, ignores international law.'

Iran condemned the Western strikes on Syria, saying no country has a right to take punitive measures against another 'beyond international procedures.'

The semi-official Fars news agency quoted Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as saying that Iran had warned about the possibility that 'terrorist groups' were behind the alleged chemical attack that triggered the strikes. It said he communicated his concerns in a phone call with Boris Johnson on Sunday.

Trump vows to sanction MORE airstrikes against Syria if Assad dares to use chemical weapons again, as Nikki Haley tells UN Security Council members they have FAILED miserably to tackle his evil regime

President Trump has vowed to carry out further airstrikes on Syria if the regime dares to use chemical weapons again, as Nikki Haley lashed out at Russia during a fiery meeting of the UN Security Council.

Scores of fast jets, fighters and destroyers fired more than 100 missiles at three military targets in Syria on Friday night in retaliation for President Assad's chemical weapons attack on the rebel enclave of Douma on April 7.

While President Trump greeted the end of the attacks with a tweet saying 'mission accomplished', Ambassador Haley promised the US was ready for another strike if Assad crossed the chemical weapons 'red line' in the future.

'The time for talk ended last night,' Haley told an emergency meeting of the Security Council called by Russia. 'We are prepared to sustain this pressure, if the Syrian regime is foolish enough to test our will.

'I spoke to President Trump this morning and he said if the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded.'

She also accused the Russians of covering up crimes committed by its ally, Assad, who she said had used chemical weapons 50 times in the past seven years of warfare.

President Trump said Saturday in his first comments since the air raid: 'Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!'

'So proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had. There won't be anything, or anyone, even close!' he tweeted.

The phrase recalled a similar claim associated with President George W. Bush following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Bush addressed sailors aboard a Navy ship in May 2003 alongside a 'Mission Accomplished' banner, just weeks before it became apparent that Iraqis had organized an insurgency that tied down U.S. forces for years.

Russia proposed a motion at the Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the airstrikes, but this was rejected with only Russia, China and Bolivia voting in favour.

Trump hailed a 'perfectly executed strike' just hours after launching a series of attacks on Syria. He wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning: 'Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!'

He added: 'So proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had. There won't be anything, or anyone, even close!'

Part of the calculation this week has also been gaming out how Russia will respond either in the region or around the world

The White House's talking points on the airstrikes emphasized the grotesqueness of the photos of children of 'dead and dying children' as a 'call to action among the world's civilized nations.'

Surrogates for the administration were told to stress in media appearance that 'actors who use these abhorrent weapons will be held accountable for their actions' but make clear that strikes 'are not intended as a provocation against the Russian Federation or its forces in Syria. We do not seek armed conflict with the Russian Federation.'

Nations that can but do not act to stop horrific attacks like the one in Syria 'make themselves complicit in these outrages,' the White House instructed its allies to say, and 'everyone must understand that the costs of using chemical weapons will always outweigh any military or political benefits.'

The talking points that were provided to DailyMail.com by a source also revealed the United States' intent to impose new sanctions on Russia in response to Moscow's 'ongoing support for the Assad regime' which the White House says has 'enabled the regime's atrocities against the Syrian people.'

Putin warns of 'consequences' for Syria airstrikes amid fears of Russian cyber attacks on British hospitals and banks as Boris defends 'standing up for civilized values' after backlash at May

Russia has delivered a dark warning of 'consequences' for the Syria strikes - as Boris Johnson passionately defended Britain's decision to stand up to 'barbarism'.

The Foreign Secretary said failure to response to Bashar Assad's use of illegal chemical weapons against his own people would have undermined 'civilised values'.

But amid fears of revenge attacks by Russia and criticism of Theresa May for acting without a Commons vote, Mr Johnson stressed there was no intention of getting more deeply involved in the Syrian civil war.

The US, UK and France hailed their missile strikes in the early hours of yesterday morning as having successfully degraded the capability of Assad to deploy chemical weapons.

The military action passed off without UK casualties or any of the Russian forces on the ground being hit.

But there are over a Russian cyber backlash that could see vital services in Britain including water supplies, gas networks, banks, hospitals and air traffic control affected in retaliation for the strikes.

Moscow's ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said: 'A pre-designed scenario is being implemented. Again, we are being threatened. We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences. All responsibility for them rests with Washington, London and Paris.'

There are concerns that cyber attacks could see electricity cuts, while Russian hackers could also disable water supplies, as well as energy grid and financial services being crippled suddenly.

Mrs May will face MPs tomorrow after defying calls for a Commons vote to be held before the military action in Syria.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the UK's air strikes 'legally questionable', forcing the Government to publish detailed legal advice justifying the bombings.

It claimed 'the UK is permitted under international law, on an exceptional basis, to take measures in order to alleviate overwhelming humanitarian suffering'.

A poll has suggested the public also had doubts about the raids.

A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday found nearly six out of ten believe there should be no more missile strikes unless Mrs May wins the backing of MPs. Only one in five were in favour of the PM using her executive powers to launch more raids.

However, she is also rated the most trusted Prime Minister to lead the nation into war since Margaret Thatcher, beating David Cameron and Tony Blair.

The Syrian children whose pain sparked the allied airstrikes: Survivors of Assad's chemical attack tell how people fell to the ground vomiting, coughing and foaming at the mouth after inhaling 'spicy' gas

The suffering of Syrian children who foamed at the mouth and struggled to breathe as they were caught up in a chemical attack last week has been revealed.

Children as young as seven have spoken of the horror they witnessed as the Assad regime targeted Douma, Eastern Ghouta, with chemical weapons last week.

The horrific attack, which left at least 70 people dead, has spurred the West into action with the US, UK and France co-ordinating airstrikes against Syria.

One girl, seven-year-old Masa, had to flee with her mother Amani while people fell to the ground around them amid clouds of white gas and dust, the Sunday Times reports from Syria.

A child evacuated from Douma is pictured arriving in Al-Bab district after the chemical attack

Amani, 34, told the newspaper: 'The gas was spicy. Spicy in my throat like chilli. I was vomiting and coughing.

'I couldn't control my body. I was just shaking the whole time. There wasn't oxygen.'

The family and their neighbours had heard bombing outside, and discovered a gas attack when two young men went to see what was happening after hearing a hissing sound, it is reported.

Amani found her husband and other daughter collapsed after inhaling the chemicals, but while her family survived everyone in the neighbouring basement died, she said.

The survivors have been living in a camp in northern Syria after many of their friends and neighbours died in the Assad regime's attack.

Another former resident of Douma, who now lives in exile, said eight of his neighbors - two women and their six children - were found dead and were were believed to have suffocated in their underground shelter from the poisonous gas.

Donald Trump cited the Syrian children's agony when he spoke from the White House to announce U.S. airstrikes.

'The evil and despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children thrashing in pain and gasping for air,' he said.

Footage posted by the White Helmets showed victims with yellowed skin crumpled on the floor, white foam emerging from their mouths.

The White House said doctors and aid organizations on the ground in Douma reported 'the strong smell of chlorine and described symptoms consistent with exposure to sarin.'

Much of the evidence comes from witness testimony, as well as video and photos shot by aid workers, victims of the attacks and unspecified additional intelligence about barrel bombs and chlorine canisters found in the aftermath.

The newspaper said unrelated survivors on the ground had reported similar symptoms suggesting they had been the victims of a chemical attack.

The symptoms included coughing, vomiting and foaming at the mouth, as well as a loss of feeling in their limbs which Amani said made it hard to get upstairs.

Corbyn demands law BANNING PM from taking military action without MP vote as he says he would NEVER deploy UK forces without UN backing - even though Russia has a veto

Jeremy Corbyn today demanded a 'war powers' law to ban the Prime Minister from taking military action without a Commons vote.

The Labour leader also made clear he does not accept that the strikes on Syria by the UK, US and France were legally justified on humanitarian grounds.

And Mr Corbyn insisted he would never countenance military action without a UN resolution - even though Russia has the power to veto them.

The comments - which will fuel deep splits within Labour - came amid a huge political row over Theresa May's decision to join reprisals against Bashar Assad over his use of chemical weapons.

Jeremy Corbyn insisted he would never countenance military action without a UN resolution - even though Russia has the power to veto them

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Corbyn said: 'I think what we need in this country is something more robust like a War Powers Act so that governments do get held to account by Parliament for what they do in our name.'

The Labour leader warned of an escalation in a 'proxy war' between the US and Russia.

He said chlorine has been used by 'a number of parties in the conflict' in Syria as a weapon.

Mr Corbyn said that if Britain wants to 'get the moral high ground around the world' it must abide by international law for taking military action.

He said the humanitarian grounds used by the UK to justify strikes was 'debatable'.

The Labour leader also made clear he does not accept that the strikes on Syria by the UK, US and France were legally justified on humanitarian grounds

'Where is the legal basis for this?' he said.

Asked if there were any circumstances in which he would back air strikes in Syria, Mr Corbyn replied: 'I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it.

'If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. That surely would save a lot of lives.'

Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said taking military action against the Assad regime had been the 'wrong thing to do'.

She told ITV's Peston On Sunday: 'We think that it should be in law that there should be a vote in Parliament before we take military action.

'NATO killers go home': Communist protest breaks out at gates of British air base in Cyprus where RAF Tornados and Typhoons were scrambled from for missile strikes on Syria

Protests have broken out at the entrance gate of a British air base in Cyprus to denounce US-led airstrikes against the Assad regime in Syria.

Around 350 demonstrators, from communist organisations in Greece and Cyprus, gathered in front of RAF Akrotiri where four Tornado warplanes took off to take part in the missile strike.

Protest leader Akis Poullos said they were demanding the closure of RAF Akrotiri, with signs condemning the 'NATO killers' after the attack.

Britain joined the U.S. and France to launch airstrikes on suspected chemical weapons sites in Syria in response to an attack on a rebel-held area last week which killed more than 75 people.

Poullos said Sunday's demonstration was also a message to the Cyprus government not to lend any assistance to 'imperialist attacks' on Syria and to demand an end to the war in the country.

Protesters used red paint to write 'NATO killers go home' on a nearby wall outside the base's gate.

Britain retained RAF Akrotiri and another military base on Cyprus after the east Mediterranean island gained independence in 1960.

The Cyprus government said it was not given any warning about Saturday's airstrikes.

It also said British Prime Minister Theresa May assured Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades that there was no danger to Cyprus and that Cypriots can feel secure."

Two Russian warships laden with military vehicles have been spotted en route to Syria after Friday's US-led airstrikes obliterated three suspected chemical weapons sites.

An Alligator-landing ship was pictured cruising down The Bosphorus on Sunday as the world awaits Vladimir Putin's response to this week's co-ordinated military action against Syria.

The vessel was spotted on its way to the Russian naval base at Tartus on the north Syrian coast.

On its fourth deployment of Russian military equipment to the war-torn country the ship was seen laden with tanks, trucks, ambulances and an IED radar.

A yellow RoRo Alexandr Tkachenko was also pictured heading for Tartus carrying high-speed patrol boats, a temporary bridge structure and several trucks. The images were posted on social media by Bosphorus-based naval observer Yörük Işık.

They come in wake of Friday's US-led campaign against Bashar al-Assad's regime and a chemical weapons attack that brutally murdered 75 civillians.

The blue Project 117 LST Orsk 148 ship was carrying Soviet BTR-80 tanks, Ramaz trucks and a Pelena-1 bomb radar, used to detect IEDs.

A second yellow cargo vessel was equipped with a BMK-T boat used for building temporary bridges and an array of other military hardware.

The Russian warships approaching Syria come after the United States outlined new economic sanctions in response to Moscow's continued support of Assad's regime in Syria.

Nikki Haley, US Ambassador to the United Nations, said measures to be imposed on Monday will send a message to Russia after it blocked six UN attempts to investigate its use of chemical weapons.

In Washington President Donald Trump stood by his comments that the strikes he commanded were a 'mission accomplished' after he was slated for repeating George W Bush's controversial use of the phrase during the Iraq war.

Meanwhile French President Emmanuel Macron today insisted the allied forces had not 'declared war' on Syria.

He told a French TV station: 'We have not declared war on the regime of Bashar al-Assad.' During the two-hour interview he also claimed he had 'convinced' Trump to maintain a military presence in Syria after the US leader threatened to pull out of the country entirely.

It emerged that Trump called Mr Macron twice before he shared his intention to strike Syria in a Twitter post. But he failed to call UK Prime Minister Theresa May in the early stages of the operation, giving the French leader the opportunity to claim France is America's leading ally in Europe.

Vladimir Putin condemned Friday's strikes as an 'act of aggression' that will worsen the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria and have a 'destructive influence on the entire system of international relations.

But Trump has vowed to carry out more if Bashar al-Assad's regime dares to use chemical weapons again.

UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson today defended Britain's decision to stand up to 'barbarism' amid criticism of Mrs May for agreeing to the strike without a vote in the House of Commons.

Mr Johnson said failure to respond to Assad's use of illegal chemical weapons against his own people would have undermined 'civilised values'.

He said 'so far, thank heavens, the Assad regime has not been so foolish to launch another chemical weapons attack,' adding that Britain and its allies 'would study what the options were' in the event of another attack.

But amid fears of revenge attacks by Russia and criticism of Theresa May for acting without a Commons vote, Mr Johnson stressed there was no intention of getting more deeply involved in the Syrian civil war.

Concerns have been raised that a cyber backlash could see vital services including water supplies, gas networks, banks, hospitals and air traffic control affected.

‹ Slide me › One of two targets hit at the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons Storage site was the storage site (pictured) which was hit at the same time by 22 missiles. The astonishing images show what appears to be the main buildings reduced to rubble

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show today, Mr Johnson said: 'You have to take every possible precaution, and when you look at what Russia has done, not just in this country, in Salisbury, attacks on TV stations, on the democratic processes, on critical national infrastructure – of course we have to be very, very cautious indeed.'

UK opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the UK's air strikes 'legally questionable', forcing the Government to publish detailed legal advice justifying the bombings. Today Mr Corbyn demanded a 'war powers' law to ban the Prime Minister from taking military action without a Commons vote.

The official legal advice claimed 'the UK is permitted under international law, on an exceptional basis, to take measures in order to alleviate overwhelming humanitarian suffering'. Mrs May will face MPs tomorrow.

Asked if there were any circumstances in which he would back air strikes in Syria, the Labour leader replied: 'I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it.

'If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. 'That surely would save a lot of lives,' he told the Andrew Marr Show.

‹ Slide me › The second site outside of Homs was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons Bunker. It was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missiles

Some 75 people, including children, are said to have died when the Syrian regime used chlorine gas and another nerve agent in Douma last Saturday.

Aid workers told how chlorine could be smelled in the air and victims were found with foam in their mouth and with burning eyes.

Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter's Square that he is `'deeply disturbed' by the international community's failure to come up with a common response to the crisis in Syria and other parts of the world.

'Despite the tools available to the international community, it is difficult to agree on a common action toward peace in Syria or other regions of the world,' the Pope told a crowd of 30,000 after his traditional Sunday blessing.

Assad continues to deny using any chemical weapons, telling visiting Russian politicians today that Western air strikes against his country were accompanied by a campaign of 'lies' and misinformation at the UN.

But in response to the deaths, scores of fast jets, fighters and destroyers fired more than 100 missiles at three military targets in Syria on Friday night.

The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Centre which was considered to be the 'heart' of the regime's chemical weapons program.

The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by 22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles. The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.

Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities.

‹ Slide me › Barzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack. A total of 76 missiles pummeled this site alone. Smoke still lingered well after the attack that happened in the early morning darkness of 4am

The Pentagon shared details early on Saturday of the successful, coordinated missile attack on Damascus which set the Syrian regime's chemical weapons program back 'years'.

At a press conference in Washington DC on Saturday morning, Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie gave a detailed break-down of the 105 missiles launched, saying: 'This is going to set the program back for years. We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.'

He also rejected the Syrian media's claim that Assad's missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over. Russia also claimed missiles had been intercepted.

French President Emmanuel Macron said today that the nation had 'not declared war on the regime of Bashar al-Assad'

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show today, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the strikes were merely aimed at deterring the use of chemical weapons

Soldiers were putting out the flames and smoke on Saturday morning as US officials celebrated the attack and said 'mission accomplished'

All of the US aircraft returned safely to base after the attack. Gen. McKenzie did not say where the Lancer B-1 Bombers had flown from but other officials suggested they were deployed from an airbase in Qatar.

'We met our objective. We hit our target. It was mission accomplished,' White said on Saturday, repeating President Trump's tweet earlier in the day.

Hours after Trump hailed the missile strike targeting the Syria's suspected chemical weapons - tweeting, 'Mission Accomplished!' - Vice President Mike Pence defended the president while building support among U.S. allies for the joint strikes with Britain and France on Saturday.

'The objective of the mission the commander in chief gave our military forces and our allies was completely accomplished - with swift professionalism,' Pence told reporters, noting there were 'no reported civilian casualties.'

He also had a warning for Russia: 'Our message to Russia is, 'you're on the wrong side of history,' ' Pence also said. 'It's time for Russia to get the message President Trump delivered last night. 'You're known by the company you keep.'

Russia has military forces, including air defences, in several areas of Syria to support President Assad in his long war against anti-government rebels.

Confusion arose over the extent to which Washington warned Moscow in advance. The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, 'Before we took action, the United States communicated with' Russia to 'reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.'

A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.

France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, hours before the Western missile strikes.

Satellite images show the Barzah Research Center, the main target, before and after the missile attack which took place at 4am local time on Saturday, 9pm EST on Friday. 76 missiles pummeled this site alone

Chief Pentagon Spokesperson Dana White (left) and Joint Staff director Marine Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie gave a briefing on the strike on Saturday and said it 'crippled' Assad's chemical weapon arsenal

Between the jets and warships, 76 missiles annihilated the Barzah research center. Fifty-seven of those were Tomahawk missiles and 19 were Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles.

The Tomahawks were mostly fired from the USS Monterey, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser and the USS Higgins, USS Laboon and the USS John Warner submarine.

France deployed its Mirage and Dassault Rafale jets and reportedly used four frigate warships. It is not clear how many aircraft were deployed. Britain is believed only to have fired missiles from its Torpedoes and Typhoon aircraft.

Other ships from each nation's military were in the region, including the USS Donald Cook, but did not fire any weapons. Despite the attack, White said the US was still committed to a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the ongoing civil war in Syria.

'Our goal has not changed. Our goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS....but Assad's actions were beyond the pale. We do not seek conflict in Syria but we cannot allow such grievous violations of international law,' she said.

'We will not stand by passively while Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, ignores international law.'

Iran condemned the Western strikes on Syria, saying no country has a right to take punitive measures against another 'beyond international procedures.'

The semi-official Fars news agency quoted Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as saying that Iran had warned about the possibility that 'terrorist groups' were behind the alleged chemical attack that triggered the strikes. It said he communicated his concerns in a phone call with Boris Johnson on Sunday."

Navy SEALs who helped rescue another four boys from a flooded cave complex in northern Thailand today have celebrated their success.

Eight boys have now been saved after the Wild Boars football team became trapped two weeks ago, leaving just four teammates and their coach stuck underground for at least another day.

'2 days, 8 Wild Boars. Hooyah,' the Thai Navy SEALs said in a post on their official Facebook page, referring to the boys and their coach by the name of their football team.

The commander of the Thai forces in the area, meanwhile, said he needed only three more days and the team would be freed.

The first of today's rescued Wild Boars players, whose identities have not yet been confirmed, were seen being carried out shortly before 5pm local time, a few hours after the mission entered its second day.

Boys number six and seven were brought out a little over an hour later, with boy number eight spotted being taken out at about 7.40pm local time.

They were all carried out on stretchers still wearing their full-face diving oxygen masks, and cared for at a nearby field hospital before being airlifted to the Chiang Rai Pranukroh Hospital, where the four players rescued on Sunday are recovering.

Thousands of rescuers including Thai Navy SEALs and elite British divers have been working around the clock to come up with a plan to bring the exhausted and starved boys home safely

Waiting to be rescued: The eight boys remaining in the cave on Monday morning, pictured, four of whom were brought out today while the others remain in the cave with their coach until at least Tuesday

The four boys brought out on Monday are in better health than those extracted on Sunday, CNN reported. That is in line with a plan to bring out the weakest first which was devised by doctors on site.

The five boys remaining in the cave and their coach are in 'good' health, the head of the rescue mission said.

A friend of the boys - and a fellow Wild Boars player - told USA Today one of the first things he wants to do for his teammates when they are free is get them fried chicken.

Poowadet Khamngern, 14, said: 'We're going to eat fried chicken at KFC.'

Another friend and Wild Boar, Waranchit Kankaew, 14, said: 'When my friends are back, we will do everything as normal. We will go to lunch together, we will play football together.'

Meanwhile the principal of Mae Sai Prasitsart School - which six of the boys attend - said they will be given extra tutoring to catch up on missed classes.

He added: 'We will not push them too hard on their studies. We will treat them positively and not put the blame on them for anything. They were the victims of a disaster.'

Despite the names and images of the four boys who were evacuated on Sunday being widely circulated in local and international media, officials have not confirmed their identities to parents, nor have families been told who was rescued today and who remains in the cave.

The 12 youth team players and their 25-year-old coach went missing on June 23, having become trapped inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in the northern Chiang Rai region by rising flood water.

The success of today's operation, which took nine hours - two hours less than Sunday - was later confirmed by the Navy SEALs involved in the operation.

Pictures show the moment boy number six was loaded onto a military helicopter to be airlifted to hospital, surrounded by army medics.

The youngster can be seen wrapped in a silver space blanket to preserve what little body heat he has left after his arduous underwater journey out of the cave.

The medical team, including a nurse, are all wearing face masks to protect their precious patient from an infection.

The first rescue of today came shortly after the commander of the mission, Narongsak Osottanakorn, said 'oxygen bottles are ready... in the next few hours we will have good news'.

He announced the operation had restarted four hours ahead of schedule on Monday morning.

The same 12 divers, including several from the UK with 'expertise in cave diving', who saved the first four on Sunday also conducted today's rescue operation.

Over several tense hours, seven crack British cave divers hailed as the masters of their profession escorted the schoolchildren through narrow, jagged tunnels.

With them were five other international divers and five Thai navy SEALS, and more than 70 other divers in support roles, 50 of whom were foreigners.

The boys were made to wear full-face masks, which enabled them to breathe freely, and were then 'essentially being pulled through the water', one British diving expert told the BBC, meaning that they have not needed to learn to dive nor swim.

Before the rescue mission began, it was raised as a potential major issue that many of the 12 boys did not know how to swim.

Peter Dennis, from the British Cave Rescue Council, told the BBC that he thought the footballers 'would have been lightly sedated by a doctor who joined them in the chamber' to make sure they would not start panicking during the long journey out through the dark, water-filled tunnels.

First four rescued Thai cave boys ask for spicy basil pork and rice after first night in hospital but children have not been able to hug or see their parents yet due to risk of infection The four members of a Thai youth football team who were rescued yesterday, after more than two weeks in a cave, are 'strong and safe', officials say. The teenagers woke up 'hungry' on Monday morning, and asked for pad kra pao - a pork and holy basil stir fry dish - with rice, the rescue chief told a press conference. They have not yet been able to see their parents due to risk of infections, and the families waiting at the rescue camp at the mouth of the cave have not been told who they are. An emergency team carries a stretcher believed to be carrying one of the rescued boys from the flooded cave to a waiting helicopter in Mae Sai, Chiang Mai province, northern Thailand Despite the names and images of the four boys who were evacuated on Sunday being widely circulated in local and international media, officials have not confirmed the identities to parents. Four more Wild Boar FC players emerged from the cave on Monday, while four more - and the team coach - will remain until at least Tuesday. Who they are is so far also being kept from families. The families of all 12 boys have since agreed to stay at the rescue camp which has formed at the mouth of the cave until the entire team and their coach are out, CNN reports. Lucky escape: Nattawoot Thakamsai, also called Tle, suffers from asthma, and was the third boy to be rescued from the cave on Sunday The first and the last : Monhkhol Boonpiam, 13, known as Mark, was the first boy to come out of the came, while Pipat Bodhu, 15, aka Nick, was the last Out: Prajak Sutham, known as Note, was also brought out by the divers on Sunday 'They (the four) will be kept away from their parents for a while because we are concerned about infections,' Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters, adding doctors will decide on family visits 'at a distance or through glass.' 'Doctors have told us we must be careful about the food that is given to them because they are fragile after starving for many days. 'The doctors are evaluating when the parents and other relatives can visit the boys in hospital. We tell them to come as soon as the doctors give permission.' Monhkhol Boonpiam, 13, Prajak Sutham, 15, Nattawoot Thakamsai, 14, and Pipat Bodhu, 15, were rescued by a team of divers on Sunday evening after 15 days of being stuck in their fetid underground prison.

While their parents will eventually be able to see them, they will not be allowed to touch or hug them until test results come back, theGuardian reports. 'Visitors will only be allowed to meet and talk to the patients,' Dr Thongchai Lertwilairattanapong told a local newspaper. 'No hugging or touching and they [visitors] need to leave a one to two metre distance from the patients until the results of their blood tests come back.' Advertisement

It is not entirely clear how the four boys extracted today were chosen from the remaining eight, but this morning it was reported that the strategy had changed from starting with the strongest, to bringing out the weakest first.

Cave diver and anaesthetist Dr Richard Harris, from Adelaide, Australia dived with the rescue team on Sunday afternoon to check on the 12 boys and their coach and advised a change in strategy.

Dr Harris' health assessment found some of the weaker boys may not survive if they were left behind, according to Thai media, and so they are thought to have been brought out first.

Authorities had been rushing to extract the boys and their coach from the cave as monsoon rains have been bearing down on the area in the past few days, but while rain is expected in the province overnight, it is not thought to hit the Tham Luang Nang Non cave.

Workers continue to pump water out, and if the area sees little to no rain overnight, the situation may have improved by Tuesday morning.

Monsoon rain patterns are very local and the area around the cave will see little precipitation, and even less than today. The lack of signficant rain with support pumping of the flooded caverns,' Johannes Sander of the Munich base industrial weather forecasters Sander and partner told the BBC.

'We've been working continuously overnight,' a Chiang Rai government source told AFP on Monday morning, requesting anonymity, and confirming that there had only been a pause of the actual extraction operations.

Meanwhile, worried parents waiting at the entrance - many of whom have been holding 24-hour vigils despite the overnight rains - say they had not being told 'anything' about which boys would be rescued from the cave, and can do nothing but wait.

With very few details released, parents of the remaining boys in the cave continued their agonising wait to be reunited with their sons on Monday.

'I am still waiting here at the cave, keeping my fingers crossed to see whether my son will be one of those to come out today,' Supaluk Sompiengjai, mother of Peerapat - known by his nickname 'Night' - told AFP.

'We heard four boys are out but we do not know who they are. Many parents are still here waiting. None of us has been informed of anything.' But she added she was 'happy' at the prospect of seeing her son again.

Her husband Somboon said parents had been told they would not be able to visit their sons once rescued.

'We have not been told which child has been brought out... We can't visit our boys in hospital because they need to be monitored for 48 hours,' he told Reuters.

Speaking in Bangkok on Monday, Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda said the four pulled from the cave on Sunday 'are strong and safe' and in the care of doctors.

Number three was Nattawoot Thakamsai, a 14-year-old asthma sufferer whose parents have already lost a baby daughter to cancer.

Lastly came Pipat Bodhu, 15, aka Nick, who was not even in the team but came along as a friend of the goalkeeper.

Commanders paused the mission overnight to replenish oxygen supplies and give the rescuers a break, before restarting today when four more were rescued.

The children, who have spent more than two weeks more or less in complete darkness will receive individual counselling with a psychiatrist as they return to life above ground, a teacher at Mae Sai Prasitsart school where several of the boys study said.

He added that they will be let off their upcoming exams next week.

'They will not have to follow the normal schedules,' Thongyaud Kejorn said at a press conference on Monday morning.

However, even after their ordeal is over, the children could still suffer post traumatic stress disorder, experts have warned.

Their experience is expected to lead to nightmares, sleep problems, stomach and headaches and clinginess with parents, as well as getting angry and upset more easily.

Dr Andrea Danese, head of the stress and development lab at Kings College London's Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, said: 'In the longer term, most children will recover from the initial emotional symptoms.

A sizeable minority, 10 to 30 per cent, will however experience enduring mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety disorders and PTSD.'"

The trapped Thai football team will not escape tonight, but authorities are likely to launch a rescue attempt in coming days if monsoonal rain begins catastrophically flooding the caves.

Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said the boys were learning to dive but were not strong enough to undertake to long journey through narrow, underwater passages.

Navigating the cave system takes an experienced diver more than five hours and the boys were not back at full strength after suffering exhaustion and starvation before rescuers found them.

Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said the boys were learning to dive but were not strong enough to undertake to long journey through narrow, underwater passages

Speaking outside the Tham Luang caves in northern Thailand, the governor ruled out a rescue attempt overnight on Friday but indicated the situation could change in days to come.

'There is no chance the boys will come out today. it is not suitable. they still cannot dive,' he said at a long-awaited press conference after midnight on Saturday local time.

'The children are learning how to dive. We'd like minimum risk, but we can't wait until it rains heavily and worsens the situation.

'If that happens, we'll need to reassess. The key thing is the kids' readiness to dive. If it rains, and the situation is not good, we will try to bring the boys out.'

Officials have long feared the coming torrential rain would catastrophically flood the cave system in Chiang Rai and make rescue impossible.

Should the rains further flood the cave, as predicted, the team could be trapped in the cave for more than four months until waters recede.

A huge operation is underway at the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex, where dozens of Thai Navy SEALs and international experts are attempting to find a way to get the boys out

However, Governor Narongsak appeared unwilling to let the 12 boys and their coach be stuck for that long, as he laughed when asked if they would be left inside.

He said rescuers 'need to make the plan that is the best plan' and were assessing options, they will then test the plan to make sure it will work with a low enough risk.

'If the risk is minimal, we will try. We are afraid of the weather and the oxygen in the cave. We have to try to set the plan and find which plan is the best,' he said.

But he appeared to rule out tunneling through the rock to reach them in favour of the boys swimming out in dive gear or being pushed through the tunnel by divers.

'The boys entered through the front of the cave, they will come out through the front,' he said.

Governor Narongsak said the boys were still healthy and have practised wearing diving masks and breathing in preparation for the diving possibility.

'There is no chance the boys will come out today. it is not suitable. they still cannot dive,' he said at a long-awaited press conference after midnight on Saturday local time.

When asked if he felt positively about the situation, he replied: 'The world is perfect'.

'I'm worried about everyone who participates in the rescue operation,' he added.

He said the boys were checked on by divers about 9pm local times, three hours before the press conference, and were found to be in good health.

Governor Narongsak added that he was the one who invited Elon Musk to send engineers from his SpaceX and Boring Company firms to help with the rescue because he knows a SpaceX employee.

Mr Musk earlier suggested bringing the boys out through a nylon tube inflated 'like a bouncy castle' to create an underwater tunnel.

Former Thai Navy SEAL Saman Kunan died after running out of oxygen in the cramped, waterlogged passageways of the Tham Luang caves in northern Thailand

Footage has emerged of Kunan preparing to fly out to join the rescue mission and revealing how he hoped to ' bring the kids home'

Earlier the body of a diver who died while taking supplies to a trapped Thai football team was repatriated with honours.

Former Thai Navy SEAL Saman Kunan died after running out of oxygen in the cramped, waterlogged passageways of the Tham Luang caves in northern Thailand.

The 38-year-old was trying to reach a cavern set up as a command centre 1.2miles inside the caves and had been leaving oxygen tanks around the network as part of preparations for rescuing the 12 young footballers. But he ran out of air at 2am local time and his diving partner was unable to revive him.

His body will be flown to his hometown in Roi Et for a royally-sponsored funeral, the Thai king announced. Pictures today showed military officials transporting his flag-draped coffin.

It comes as footage emerged of Kunan at an airport preparing to fly out to join the rescue mission and revealing how he hoped to 'bring the kids home.'

'See you tonight at Tham Luang. We will bring the kids home,' said an upbeat Saman, wearing a grey polo shirt and blue, tinted glasses, before signing off on the video clip and setting off for the province of Chiang Rai on the Myanmar border.

Officials have warned that the window of opportunity to free the youngsters is now 'limited' amid fears of heavy rainfall.

'At first, we thought the children could stay for a long time... but now things have changed, we have a limited time,' said Arpakorn Yookongkaew, commander of Thai navy SEALs working at the site.

A senior army commander, Major General Chalongchai Chaiyakam, said that the most pressing mission now is to provide an oxygen line to reach the kids.

Yookongkaew said that Kunan was working in a volunteer capacity to help the 12 boys and their 25-year-old coach.

Kunan's final Facebook post was a picture of him proudly posing with his comrades at the mouth of the Than Luang cave.

A huge operation is underway at the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex, where dozens of Thai Navy SEALs and international experts are attempting to find a way to get the boys out.

Former Thai Navy SEAL Samarn Kunan, 38, (pictured) has died while trying to help rescue the young football team trapped in a cave in Thailand

Rescuers have been examining ways to rescue the boys, including fitting them with full-face oxygen masks and accompanying them on a long, dangerous swim through the tunnels.

However, the death of an experienced diver in the cave system underlines the inherent risks in attempting to move the boys, who are physically weak after days without food.

They are the equivalent of the length of two Empire State buildings underground - more than 800m.

Yookongkaew today insisted morale remained high among rescuers despite Kunan's death.

'These accidents can happen sometimes to anyone in the field, but we will go ahead and keep working,' Yookongkaew told The Guardian.

He added: 'We won't let his life be in vain. We will carry on.'

The SEAL unit said in a statement that Kunan's diving partner had found him unconscious in the water and tried to revive him but could not save his life.

They paid tribute to their former colleague, describing him as a 'skilled and talented Seal and a triathlon athlete'.

Their statement added: 'Even after he departed the Seal unit, he still kept in touch and maintained a tie with the rest of his former colleagues.

'He always participated in the Seal activities until the last step of his life. Saman left us while working as a diver and in a time where all divers joining forces to complete the mission. His effort and determination will always remain the hearts of all divers.

'May you rest in peace and we will accomplish this mission as you had wished.'

On his Instagram account, Kunan appeared to be an avid cyclist, posting several pictures of himself mountain biking.

In a post on Wednesday, Samarn uploaded pictures of himself in action with a rescue team, both outside and inside the Tham Luang cave.

A spokesman for the navy, Rear Admiral Chetta Jaipiem, said the navy would seek 'special permission' to posthumously promote Samarn, who was a petty officer first class when he left the unit.

U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Glyn T. Davies offered his condolences to Samarn's family.

'On behalf of the American people, I extend my deepest condolences to his family and commend his true bravery and selflessness in service to his country,' Davies said in a statement.

Meanwhile, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that engineers from his firms - SpaceX and The Boring Company - were heading to Thailand to see if they could assist the rescue.

The firms have 'advance ground penetrating radar' that is 'pretty good at digging holes' or technology that could 'create an air tunnel underwater' for the children to traverse, Musk said earlier.

The Thai government said Musk's team could help the rescue operation with location tracking, water pumping or battery power.

'We cannot live normally': Family's heart-ache as they keep 24-hour vigil at cave entrance The family of one of the young footballers stranded in the flooded cavern in Thailand have told of her heart-ache as they anxiously wait for his rescue. The parents of 14-year-old Prajak Sutham have kept a 24-hour vigil at the entrance of the Thamg Luang cave since their beloved son became trapped almost two weeks ago. Now his grandmother has revealed how the family are struggling to cope with the stress of his disappearance – but remain hopeful that he will be brought out alive. Matriarch Kiangkham Janthapoon has revealed how she wanted to die when her first grandchild, known as Note, went missing but how her faith in his survival was restored when he was discovered by British pot-holers earlier this week. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline the 66-year-old grandmother said: 'On the second day after Note went missing I just wanted to die. He is my first grandchild and I am so worried about him. The family of Prajak Sutham, one of the young footballers stranded in the flooded cavern in Thailand, have told of her heart-ache as they anxiously wait for his rescue. His mother Ratdao Chantapoon is pictured Prajak Sutham is pictured at the age of 11, graduating from school. He is one of 12 footballers still trapped inside a flooded cave in the Tham Luang Forest Park 'I cannot sleep and I have hardly eaten since he went missing with the other boys. He is such a good boy. He is trust worthy and he works hard at school. The whole family is distraught.' Fighting back tears 66-year-old Kiangkham added: 'But we were so happy when the British divers found him them alive in the cave. Now we just want them to get out as quickly and safely as possible.' Note's mother Ratdao Janthapoon, and father Sudsakhon Sutham rushed to the remote jungle entrance to the cave the morning after he failed to return from the football club excursion. The parents of 14-year-old Prajak Sutham (pictured) have kept a 24-hour vigil at the entrance of the Thamg Luang cave since their beloved son became trapped almost two weeks ago The pair have maintained a 24-hour vigil there, desperately waiting for news of their beloved son. Yesterday mum Ratdao, 35, led prayers for the missing boys at a shrine close to the tunnel. In a moving ceremony mothers of the missing footballers lit incense sticks and made offerings of rice in front of a statue of Buddha and called upon the deity to make the flood waters recede and their sons be brought home safely. Sarisa Promjak, Note's aunt, explained: 'My sister has been up the cave since the day after Note went missing and she has been there ever since. 'She and her husband spend day and night there. They have only left to come home to have a quick shower and then go back again. Her husband, Note's dad, says he cannot eat. They say they will not leave until their boy is safe.'

Pictures of Note graduating from Kindergarten and primary school are displayed in pride of place. The 24-hour news channel has been on since the youngsters disappeared as the family desperately cling to hope of Note's safe return. Aunt Sarisa, 50, explained: 'Note has a little sister called Now, she is only two, but she keeps asking where he is. 'She knows that he is in the cave and whenever his face comes on to the TV she reaches up to him. Now misses him.' News of the disaster first reached Note's family from other anxious parents. They hoped the boys had been trapped by a flash-flood. But when the waters failed to recede from the cave they began to worry. Aunt Sarisa explained: 'We thought the boys had been caught in a flash flood and that they would be able to walk out the next day. But the days have turned into weeks and we are distraught with worry. 'His grandmother Kiangkham is 66 and has hyper tension, his grandfather Jai Janthapoon is 69 and is not in good health.

His family are anxiously waiting news about the rescue operation 'When we sit down for a meal we think that the boys have nothing to eat, when we go to bed we think about the boys having to spend another night in the cave, when we hear the rain we worry that the cave will get more flooded. We cannot live normally. 'My sister phoned today and told us she was worried about the changing weather conditions. Because if it rains at the weekend it will make the rescue effort more difficult. 'The only thing that has made us feel better was when the boys were found alive by the British divers. We really want to thank the British divers for finding the boys. 'We want to thank all of the rescue workers for everything they are doing to get them out of the cave. And we want to thank everyone from around the world for all their prayers and support. 'We feel so bad for the Navy Seal who lost his life trying to save them. We are so grateful for his sacrifice. Advertisement

Relatives of the boys, some of whom have camped at the site for weeks, say all they want is the safest exit for their children.

'I'm worried...he has never dived,' said Somboon Kaewwongwan, the father of a 16-year-old boy trapped in the cave.

It takes even the most experienced divers up to five hours to swim through jagged, narrow channels from where the boys are to safety outside.

Speaking to CNN on Wednesday, Cade Courtley, a former US Navy SEAL said bringing the children out through the flooded tunnels could be treacherous.

He says that even divers with considerable expertise have been 'climbing up, climbing through, going (through water with) zero visibility to finally get through the team. Now you're going to ask 11 to (16) year olds - some of whom cannot swim - to make that same journey for the first time breathing air underwater? I think that's a terrible mistake given some of the options we have.'

Governor Narongsak has revealed that the three of the stranded children are also 'quite weak, weaker than the other boys'.

The level of oxygen in the cave has also become a cause for concern, with authorities revealing levels have dropped to 15 per cent. The usual level is 21 per cent.

Narongsak Osatanakorn, the governor of Chiang Rai province, said that oxygen has been depleting inside the cave due to the presence of hundreds of rescue workers.

Holes are being drilled in the jungle above the cave to try and increase air supply and about 30 oxygen tanks have also been released in their area.

Authorities are also laying an air pipe from the entrance into the cave but said on Friday that another 1.7km of piping is needed.

Elon Musk sends engineers from his Boring Company to help Thai cave rescue mission - and proposes creating underwater air tube for the children to crawl through Tech billionaire Elon Musk has sent his top engineers to help rescue 12 schoolboys and their football coach trapped in a flooded Thai cave. On Twitter Musk suggested an underwater air tube could be created for the children to crawl through. The 46-year-old said his Boring Co, which digs tunnels for advanced transport systems, plan to insert a nylon tube into the cave before inflating it 'like a bouncy castle' to create an underwater tunnel. Elon Musk has sent his top engineers to help rescue schoolboys trapped in a Thai cave He made the announcement on Twitter after brainstorming different ways to evacuate the kids Musk said a nylon tube could be inflated 'like a bouncy castle' to create an underwater tunnel He said engineers from his Boring Co and SpaceX companies needed to be on site to oversee the evacuation. A spokesman for The Boring Company, said: 'We are speaking with the Thai government to see how we can help, and we are sending SpaceX/Boring Company people from the US to Thailand today to offer support on the ground. 'Once we confirm what exactly will be helpful to send or do, we will. 'We are getting feedback and guidance from the people on the ground in Chiang Rai to determine the best way for us to assist their efforts.' The tech billionaire initially responded to a tweet pleading him to help with the rescue mission At first he explored the idea of using an 'advanced ground penetrating radar' to help rescuers He claimed that it could supply 'fully charged Powerpacks and pumps' to aid the mission Mr Musk initially brainstormed the idea of using an 'advanced ground penetrating radar' to help rescuers. He claimed that it could supply 'fully charged Powerpacks and pumps' to aid the mission. Musk then came up with the idea of inserting a nylon tube into the cave network to create an air tunnel underwater. None of the 12 boys can swim or dive, which rescuers said is essential in freeing them.

'The top priority today is to fill the air inside [where the boys are]' said deputy army commander Chalongchai Chaiyakham.

'We've got to finish laying the air pipe today...With the air filled, the kids could stay for months.'

The rescue mission's chief engineer is also looking into the possibility of rescuing the boys by drilling a hole where they are located.

Rescuers initially believed that drilling was too dangerous due to the fact the boys and their coach are trapped in a small space.

The official who is leading the rescue operation met with the boys' families last night.

He maintained that the preferred rescue option was to escort the youngsters out with scuba divers with navy chaperones.

It has not been decided whether the stronger or the weaker boys would be evacuated first, but the boys will come out one at a time.

The governor would not confirm when the evacuation would begin but maintained the boys would only be brought out when the rescuers were 100 per cent sure they would be safe.

Officials have long feared the coming torrential rain would catastrophically flood the cave system in Chiang Rai and make rescue impossible

Football stars send messages of support to trapped boys as FIFA invites them to the World Cup final FIFA president Gianni Infantino has invited the Thai boys' football team trapped in a cave to the World Cup final, as messages of support poured in from top players. Infantino said he hoped the Wild Boars team, who were stranded by rising floodwaters two weeks ago, would be rescued in time to watch the final in Moscow on July 15. 'If, as we all hope, they are reunited with their families in the coming days and their health allows them to travel, FIFA would be delighted to invite them to attend the 2018 World Cup final as our guests,' he wrote in a letter to the head of the Football Association of Thailand. 'I sincerely hope that they will be able to join us at the final, which will undoubtedly be a wonderful moment of communion and celebration.' The Thai footballers, aged 11-16, have been stuck in darkness deep underground after setting off to explore the cave with their 25-year-old coach after training on June 23. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has wished the Thai cave boys his support while they are stuck in the cave The players remain trapped despite being reached this week by cave-diving rescuers, who released footage of them looking emaciated but calm, some wearing football shirts. Their harrowing ordeal coincides with the World Cup in Russia and it has not escaped the attention of players. 'I've been speaking about it with a few of the boys,' said England defender John Stones, according to British media. 'It's so sad to see where they are and we hope they get out safe and sound.' Japan's World Cup squad tweeted a video urging the team to 'Hang in there!', while Brazil legend Ronaldo called their plight 'terrible'.

Posted by FA Thailand on Thursday, 5 July 2018 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp urged them to 'stay strong and know we are with you', in a video message sent to CNN. 'We are following all the news and hoping every second that you see daylight again,' Klopp said. 'We are all very optimistic that it will happen, hopefully in minutes, hours or the next few days.' Meanwhile the Croatian Football Federation said it was 'awed' by the team's calm under pressure. 'We are awed by the bravery and strength that these young boys and their coach have shown amidst such frightening circumstances,' it said on its website. Many fans on social media said the boys deserved the World Cup trophy for the way they have handled their ordeal. Afp

Meanwhile, fears are growing that time is running out to rescue the boys and their coach.

Officials have long feared the coming torrential rain would catastrophically flood the cave system in Chiang Rai and make rescue impossible.

Should the rains further flood the cave, as predicted, the team could be trapped in the cave for more than four months until waters recede.

Provincial Governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn said the mission was 'a race against the water' that will flow in with the monsoon.

'Our biggest concern is the weather. We are calculating how much time we have if it rains, how many hours and days,' he said.

Nineteen massive pumps are trying to lower the water levels - but this has been hampered after unregistered volunteers started pumping water back into the caves in the belief they were helping.

The boys aged 11 to 16 and the coach have practised wearing diving masks and Thai Navy Seals were told to prepare for a sudden evacuation.

However, the teams were still too weak to attempt to leave their flooded cave with two boys and the coach suffering from exhaustion.

Water was accidentally pumped back into caves by volunteers amid desperate attempts to lower flooding levels in the sprawling underground network, it has emerged

A medical assessment found it was still too dangerous to try to move the youngsters, an unnamed source in the Thai Navy Seals told CNN.

Two boys and the 25-year-old coach are suffering with exhaustion through malnutrition, according to a new doctor's report.

A team of bird's nest collectors from southern Thailand arrived to put their generations-old rock climbing skills to use to help with the rescue mission.

The eight men are Thai Muslims from Libong island in Trang province, where they climb limestone cliffs to collect the edible nests, a delicacy made from solidified bird spit that can go for hundreds of pounds per kilo.

'One member in our team was watching (the rescue mission) on television and thought 'how can we help them?',' team leader Abdulrawheep Khunraksa said.

'We thought that we might have the expertise to help since we have climbed to collect bird's nests for generations,' the 49-year-old added.

Armed with ropes, gloves and their knowledge, the team set off up the steep slope in the hopes of finding an alternative route to reach the boys inside the Tham Laung cave.

An international team of experts is desperately trying to come up with a way of rescuing them before monsoon rain sets in. Today Pong's family said the Liverpool supporter, who plays as a left sided midfielder, 'would love England to win' in Russia and loves Three Lions captain Harry Kane. His uncle, Chai Jaiwong, told The Sun : 'We are worried sick about him and just want him home. He had been watching the World Cup with me before all this happened and he would love England to win it. 'His favourite player in the world is Messi but he loves English football and Harry Kane. He's football mad and spends all his spare time playing or watching.' Previously, the teenager's teacher Manutsanun Kuntun told AFP that Pong had joined the youth leagues with the wish of one day going professional. 'Pong is a cheerful boy, he likes football, and every sport. He dreams of becoming a footballer for the Thai national team. Our class is still confident he will be OK.'

Rescue teams hope that water can be sufficiently drained, allowing the trapped children to wade to safety while wearing lifejackets.

A former US Navy SEAL with thousands of hours of experience of diving in difficult conditions has warned that there will be fatalities if the children have to dive out.

Cade Courtley said the situation was currently stable and non life threatening, but that 'some of these kids are going to die' if they are made to swim through the narrow dark tunnels.

It comes after Tham Luang operation commander Narongsak Osotthanakorn said unregistered volunteers had been diverting water back into the ground in the belief they were helping.

'They may have some belief that their technique is effective for ground water drainage, but anything that is not in the plan must be discussed with us first,' he said.

Mr Narongsak, the former Chiang Rai governor, added: 'We are concerned about rain. We are racing against water. Water is flowing into the cave although we have plugged its channels.'

In a further twist, he revealed that a new phone was being transported to the cave after a previous device fell in the water and stopped working.

He also revealed the children have undergone their first day of scuba diving training in preparation for their evacuation.

They will undergo a thorough medical examination to decide whether they are fit enough for the arduous escape.

Chiang Rai provincial governor Narongsak Osatanakorn, who is overseeing the rescue, said 30 teams are searching for an airhole

Authorities did not under-estimate the challenge facing the youngsters, Governor Narongsak said, revealing that it took the Thai Navy Seals six hours to reach the boys and five hours to return, negotiating their way through the complex cave system.

But he said: 'The water level remains the main concern and the need for urgency.'

It comes as it emerged there may be a secret passage out of the cave. The boys aged 11 to 16 told rescuers they have heard dogs barking, roosters crowing and children playing despite being 800 metres underground.

This has led officials to think there may be another way out through a 'chimney hole' to the surface.

Osatanakorn, who is overseeing the rescue, said 30 teams are searching for an airhole. He believes there must be one for the boys to have been able to breathe for so long.

If rescuers can drill down to the boys, that would offer an alternative to teaching them how to swim and scuba dive so they can be led to safety through the flooded cave.

The youngsters aged 11 to 16 and their 25-year-old coach were on Monday found alive by British volunteer divers John Volanthen and Rick Stanton after nine days lost in the Thamg Luang cave network in the country's north, which they reportedly entered as part of an initiation ritual.

On Wednesday Mr Osatanakorn said that 'all 13 may not come out at the same time.'

He said authorities will evaluate their readiness each day and if there is any risk will not proceed.

'If the condition is right and if that person is ready, 100 per cent, he can come out,' he added.

It comes after a new video was released showing the boys in good spirits after 11 days underground.

The boys and their coach are seen sitting with Thai Navy Seals in the dark cave with their visibly skinny faces illuminated by the beam of a flashlight.

The youngsters, many wrapped in foil warming blankets, take turns introducing themselves, folding their hands together in a traditional greeting and saying their names and that they are healthy.

The minute-long video was recorded some time on Tuesday and was posted on the Navy Seal Facebook page on Wednesday morning.

The boys and their coach disappeared after they went exploring in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Chiang Rai province after a football game on June 23.

Meanwhile, the anguished mothers of the stranded school boys today offered prayers for the swift rescue of their beloved sons.

Nine relatives of the missing footballers lit incense sticks made offering of rice to a shrine just yards from the entrance of the Tham Luang cavern, near Mae Sai, in the far north of the country.

In a moving ceremony the mothers bowed their heads in prayer in front of statue of Buddha and called upon the deity to make the water flooding the cave recede and for their sons to be brought to the surface quickly and safely.

Among the family members was Ratdao Chantapoon, the mother of Prajak Sutham, 14, one of 12 boys from the Wild Boar football team who ventured into the underground network with their coach last month.

A friend revealed that the mothers decided to pray and make offerings to the Buddha and the sacred spirit.

'They have faith in the rescue operation to bring them out of the cave safely. But they wanted to offer their prayers to the sacred spirit to help.'

The teammates, who were trapped inside when heavy rains flooded the cave, were found by rescue divers late on Monday night.

A desperate search drew experts from around the globe, including British divers Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, who were the first rescuers to reach the group.

Authorities said the boys were being looked after by seven members of the Thai Navy Seals, including medics, who were staying with them inside the cave.

Chicago – Attorneys for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives Monday for a follow-up interview about his reported assault.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

Lawyers for US actor Jussie Smollett have denied he had any role in an assault last month he alleges was carried out by two white men.

Their statement came after sources told US media that police believed he may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack on 29 January.

The brothers, who worked as extras on ‘Empire’, the show Smollett starred in, have been questioned by Chicago police.

Police have only said the “trajectory of the investigation” has shifted.

“Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” a statement from lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

One of the brothers is Smollett’s personal trainer, and the lawyers said it was “impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity”.

They had questioned the two brothers— Ola and Abel Osundairo— last week but the pair were released on Friday and are said to be still co-operating with the investigation.

The brothers had left the US after the alleged attack and were arrested on their return last Wednesday.

Police sources told US media the pair had bought rope used in the attack at a nearby hardware store.

Police searching their flat found ropes, masks and bleach, CBS reported.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

“We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Ola and Abel Osundairo have both appeared as extras on ‘Empire’, a drama about a hip-hop mogul and his family. In this Instagram post, Ola Osundairo (R) is seen alongside ‘Empire’ creator Lee Daniels (C).

What has Smollett himself said about the alleged attack?

He said two white men hurled racial and homophobic insults as they punched him, poured a chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck.

“This is Maga country,” he says they told him, referring to President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan.

The actor said he had been “forever changed” by the incident."

Smollett has been a star on the FOX Television show “Empire.”

On February 17, an attorney for Smollett said he the actor was “angered and devastated by recent reports” stating that the police were changing their theory of the case to the direction of an “orchestrated” hate attack. Unsubstantiated rumors swirled that the two suspects arrested in the crime provided evidence to the investigators that contributed to the change in direction on the part of the investigators.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed in a statement. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” he added.

Smollett’s response to rumor that the attack was staged was pointed.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” Smollett stated through his attorneys.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continues. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Chicago Police spokesman Guglielmi told reporters. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” he added.

Several reports claim that Smollett offered to pay two Nigerian models, Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, $4,000 to stage the January 29 assault. Those reports are unconfirmed.

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday, Feb. 15, without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

Smollett, who is black, and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

A CNN article indicates police sources have come to believe Smollett paid the two men to stage the attack. A source also told CNN that police traced the purchase of the rope found around Smollett’s neck to a purchase made by one of the arrested brothers at a Chicago hardware store.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in their statement.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett’s account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Interviewer Robin Roberts brings up that people supported him earlier, but now have doubts as time has passed.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, in which he said he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

When asked why he feels he was targeted, Smollett said it is because he speaks out against President Trump. But Roberts reminds him that President Trump said, “I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned” when asked about Smollett’s alleged attack. A clip of that response is included in the interview video.

“It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,” tweeted Donald Trump Jr., as the idea that Smollett manufactured the incident started to spread.

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

Like actually including some skepticism of unverified claims as one might be so bold as to expect of professional “objective, unbiased” journalists?

Is it too much to ask CNN to bring an ounce of critical evidence to claims – especially on highly socially divisive topics such as a heinous hate crime – instead of closing their eyes and parroting whatever is the story line du jour merely because of politically convenient narratives?

How many embarrassing retractions, walk-backs, corrections, and deleted articles will it take?

Watch yet another avalanche of fake mainstream media viral “coverage”:

Montage of mainstream media spreading fake news that #JussieSmollett was attacked by white men in MAGA hats. pic.twitter.com/1RV7YFtIQt — Mark Dice (@MarkDice) February 17, 2019

Instead we once again see CNN and virtually all other left-leaning mainstream outlets spreading legitimately fake news like wild-fire merely because a given narrative is politically and ideologically convenient to their corporate owners, because you know… MAGA.

The mere mention of “White men in MAGA hats” immediately crushes the mainstream’s ability for critical analysis, as many recent instances of embarrassing media mea culpas prove. And they are becoming too many to count of late. As it now turns out, Donald Trump Jr. is correct in pointing out that:

It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story.

As Fox News’ Brian Flood also remarks, “CNN is all in on the Jussie Smollett news… but they keep forgetting the part where he claimed attackers were Trump supporters.”

https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1096948386459201536

Indeed see for yourself CNN’s initial wall-to-wall reporting of the now confirmed fake “this is MAGA country” supposedly racial and homophobic attack.

As the story unraveled and as police began to prove it was obviously all a hoax, CNN went full-bore in the other direction, finally turning against the Empire star, with a panel of guests denouncing what what many suspected all along — that Smollett staged a hate crime hoax.

And yet, CNN and other networks while attempting a collective mea culpa have still manage to blame Trump and his supporters. The Daily Caller’s Chuck Ross notes that even amidst the embarrassing fallout, “Every single NYT, WaPo, CNN, NBC, CBS, etc. reporter who has commented on this topic has defended the dear journalists” — as in the ones who got the facts wildly wrong in the first place.

Vox’s Liz Plank’s hot take on the “This is MAGA country” quote repeatedly featured and spread by the mainstream is that it was driven by “good intentions”. Plank had the gall to say while appearing on a CNN Sunday:

The people who were repeating that quote were not news outlets…It was repeated by, sure, people who maybe had good intentions of wanting to spread the story…We can’t confuse celebrity tweets with the media and the press.

But CNN and the rest of the mainstream falling in line lockstep behind fake reporting is nothing new. So perhaps a trip down recent history memory lane is in order…

Remember this from last year? A video circulated of all the broadcasters saying the exact same thing based on Sinclair Broadcast Group, the nation’s largest owner of local television stations, scripting the news for all its affiliates.

Also crucial to recall is the same drumbeat of the past two years:

“The beginning of the end of the Trump presidency…”

“The tipping point…”

“The walls are closing in…”

“Trump’s going down…”

“He will not serve out his term…”

And guess what? There’s often real life consequences of fake news for those not sheltered within the cozy offices of mainstream media corporate high rises.

Maybe it’s time for the major networks to collectively take a long (many might prefer permanent) pause, maybe a lengthy vacation for some much needed reflection and introspection?

Yes CNN, the walls are closing in… on the mainstream media.

Meanwhile perhaps it’s time for CNN’s “media janitor”, Brian Stelter, who is oh so quick to point out the bias in every other network except his own, tackle the most difficult and embarrassing question: why were the mainstream – and fringe – journalists who were skeptical of Smollett’s claims, attacked and forced to self-censor when the case was unfolding, and will continue to self-censor knowing that if they criticize Smollett directly they would be accused of homophobia and racism?

The actor and singer claimed he was attacked at a Subway by two men in ski masks in Chicago on January 29 at around 2am.

The Empire star told police the attackers poured a bleach-like chemical on him and tied a rope noose around his neck, yelling racist and homophobic insults as well as 'This is MAGA country'.

He told officers the unknown chemical substance was used on him while 'Empire f****t' and 'Empire n*****' was shouted at him.

But on February 15, unconfirmed reports emerged suggesting the openly-gay actor might have staged the attack to save his job with help from two Nigerian brothers that he reportedly knew as extras on Empire.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initially said 'attack' on actor Jussie Smollett was 'an affront to humanity', but deleted the post when allegations he staged the attack emerged

Jussie Smollett has denied he paid two Nigerian brothers who were extras on Empire to help stage a homophobic and racist attack on him outside a Subway in Chicago

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deleted her tweet posted on the evening of the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett

Investigators have said they believe Smollett may have paid Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo $3,500 to assault him in the orchestrated, rehearsed attack.

Before any suggestion the attack was staged, a number of prominent politicians and celebrities tweeted their support for Smollett.

One of these was House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who wrote on the day of the attack: 'The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.'

One of the brothers is Smollett's personal trainer, according to a statement to ABC News from Smollett's attorneys.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: 'We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

Chicago PD confirmed on Thursday that the pair seen in this image from surveillance footage around the time of the attack on January 29 (above) were Abel and Ola Osundairo

Hours after Smollett's alleged attack occurred, Booker tweeted that the attack was 'an attempted modern-day lynching' and urged Congress to make lynching a federal hate crime. He said this weekend that he was now 'withholding judgement' until more information emerges

'We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.'

The pair decided to cooperate with police after investigators revealed that they had evidence the brothers bought the rope that was put around Smollet's neck at the nearby at Crafty Beaver Hardware Store hardware store.

Smollett's attorneys released a statement denying he staged his own attack, saying: 'As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

'He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

'Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.'

Al Sharpton, who was among those who condemned the attack, denied that it was a 'left wing hoax' because the President had also spoken out against. Sharpton shared two videos on Twitter on Sunday about the incident and said if Smollett was found to have orchestrated the attack, he should be brought to justice

It was claimed that Smollett allegedly paid Nigerian brothers Abimbola 'Abel' (left) and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo (right) to attack him on January 29

Others have yet to retract their original statements or delete their tweets, including California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Democratic Sen. Corey Booker, who are both running for the Democratic 2020 nomination for president.

While Booker was meeting supporters in Rochester, New Hampshire on Sunday, he told reporters that in the wake of the new reports about the alleged attack, he was 'going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources' before making any judgments about Smollett.

Booker also urged a broader fight against hate crimes and called the attack an 'attempted modern day lynching'.

Over the weekend, when asked about the most recent developments in the case, he said he was 'withholding judgement' until more information emerged.

Al Sharpton said the alleged attack was a 'reminder of the times we live in' when it was first reported on January 30.

The Democratic reverend doubled down on his rebuke of it in a Twitter video on Sunday.

'I said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with to find out what happened.

'I still maintain that and if it is found that Smollett and these gentlemen did perpetrate something that is not true, [they should be brought to] accountability,' he said.

He added, however, that it was not a 'left wing hoax' because even the president had condemned the incident.

Chicago police today said investigators still want to do a follow-up interview with Smollett, but the actor has not yet made himself available to be questioned.

Reports of a possible grand jury emerged hours after the Chicago Police Department said Smollett was not yet being considered an official suspect.

Sources said Smollett initially agreed to sign complaints against his attackers, but declined to do so once he heard that Abel and Ola were the men in custody because he knew them and felt bad, not wanting to see the pair prosecuted."

The 4,500-year-old secrets of the Great Pyramid of Giza's maze of hidden chambers are set to be revealed by an inflatable robot.

Researchers are building a blimp-like probe that enters ancient monuments via a 3.5-centimetre (1.4-inch) 'keyhole' drilled through a wall.

Once inflated inside the chamber, the drone flies like a blimp to explore inaccessible areas with minimal damage to artefacts or structures hidden within.

Last month, a mysterious 30-metre (100ft) void nestled above the pyramid's Grand Gallery deep within the monument was discovered by an international team of researchers.

HOW IT WORKS The device enters rooms and chambers through a 3.5 centimetre hole drilled through a wall by researchers outside. It is made up of two robots, a tubular machine equipped with a high definition camera and a probe that explores the structure via a small, inflatable blimp. After the first robot has taken a series of reconnaissance images, the drone is pushed through the drilled hole before inflating itself within the chamber. Packed with an array of sensors and cameras, the remote-controlled device collects data and takes photos or video without causing damage to the fragile building. After it has completed its mission, the floating probe returns to its docking station and deflates before it is extracted via the the same tube it entered in. Advertisement

The discovery was made using 'cosmic ray imaging' in which subatomic particles that naturally rain down from the sky are used to map buildings like an X-ray scan.

Now scientists hope to use a new minimally-invasive robot to explore why chambers such as these were built.

The project has been initiated by ScanPyramids, the same group of researchers that made last month's historic Giza find, made up of engineers from Cairo University and the Florida-based HIP Institute.

Its aim is to build a robot capable of exploring the inner depths of old buildings and ancient monuments with minimal structural damage by entering through a 3.5-centimetre (1.5 inch) hole drilled through a wall.

'The main challenge is to insert a complete exploration robot in a hole that is as small as possible.' lead researcher Dr Jean-Baptiste Mouret told Digital Trends.

'It is important to use a hole as small as possible because we want to leave as few traces as we can. This what we call 'minimally invasive robotics'.'

The device is made up of two robots, a tubular machine equipped with a high definition camera and a probe that explores the structure via a small, inflatable blimp.

After the first robot has completed initial imaging to check the room is worth exploring, the drone is pushed through the drilled hole where it inflates itself within the chamber.

Packed with an array of sensors and cameras, the remote-controlled device collects data and takes photos or video without causing damage to the fragile building.

After it has completed its mission, the floating probe returns to its docking station and deflates before it is extracted via the the same tube it entered in.

The robot is being developed by scientists from France's Inria research institution and National Centre for Scientific Research, both based in Paris.

THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA'S 'HIDDEN VOID' News that ScanPyramids is developing a new floating probe system comes just a few weeks after the research team discovered a long-hidden narrow void within Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza. The void stretches for at least 30 metres (100ft) above the Grand Gallery - an ascending corridor that links the Queen's chamber to the King's in the heart of the pyramid. It is not known why the void exists or if there are any valuable artefacts inside as it is not obviously accessible. But it has similar dimensions to the Gallery, which is 50 metres (164ft) long, eight metres (26ft) high and around a metre (3.2ft) wide. Researchers suggested it could be a 'construction gap' - part of a trench that allowed workers to access the Grand Gallery and King's Chamber while the rest of the pyramid was built. The discovery was made after physicists took images of the inside of the pyramid using particles fired to Earth from space. News that ScanPyramids is developing a new floating probe system comes just a few weeks after the research team discovered a long-hidden narrow void (highlighted in red) within Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza

The project team said that a floating robot will be quicker and easier to manoeuvre than ground-based probes, as it will not need to navigate stairs, rocks or falling debris.

Being inflatable, the probe is less likely to damage anything it collides with than a rotary or other flying drone, they said.

Currently, Dr Mouret said there is no 'concrete timeline' for deploying the robots inside the Great Pyramid, which will require special permits from Egypt's Ministry of Antiquity.

The Great Pyramid of Giza has been shrouded in mystery for millennia, but in November a long-held secret of its structure was uncovered thanks to particle physics. An apparent narrow void lying undiscovered deep within the ancient Wonder of the World was found by scientists using cosmic-ray based imaging. An overview of the breakthrough is shown here

WHAT WAS THE VOID USED FOR? Because no one has physically seen inside the void, what it was built for remains a mystery. The researchers say the space has remained hidden since it was first constructed 4,500 years ago. It could be one big space, but may also be made up of several chambers or tunnels. The void could be on an incline, which means it could have been used to transport huge blocks into the centre of the pyramid and was then left. Researchers suggest it could also be a 'construction gap' - part of a trench that allowed workers to access the Grand Gallery and King's Chamber while the rest of the pyramid was built. More simply, the void may have simply been left there to relieve weight from the Grand Gallery below.

But once the device has been developed, it could be used to help map other heritage buildings and archaeological sites across the globe.

The discovery was made after physicists took images of the inside of the pyramid using particles fired to Earth from space.

These cosmic particles penetrate the rock in a similar way to X-rays, only much deeper.

The collaborative effort, between archaeologists, historians and physicists, was hailed as the biggest discovery inside the Giza landmark since the 19th century.

Described as a 'deep void', it is at least about 100 feet long and up to 230 feet above ground, running over the Grand Gallery. Its function is unknown, and scientists are now hoping a flying robot could be sent in to uncover its secrets

Made under the watch of the Pharaoh Khufu and completed in around 2550 BC, Egypt's Great Pyramid, or the Pyramid of Giza, served as the world's tallest man-made construction for thousands of years.

The structure, also known as Khufu's Pyramid, is the sole survivor of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World.

How it was built has long been a bone of academic contention and there is no universal agreement about its creation.

The internal structure (white dots in image) is located above the Grand Gallery - that links two of the pyramid's chambers - and traces a similar route for at least 30 metres (100ft). It could either lie on a horizontal or inclined (pictured) plane, experts said

MUON DETECTORS Muons are created when cosmic rays react with the upper atmosphere, producing a shower of particles (artist's impression), some of which decay into muons Muon detectors have previously been used to map out the inside of the Fukushima's nuclear reactor in Japan and it is hoped they can be used to explore other archaeological sites. The detectors work by using cosmic particles known as muons that have the power to penetrate deeply into most materials. The subatomic particles require only a few special instruments because they rain down naturally from the atmosphere above. Muons are created when the upper atmosphere reacts with cosmic rays, producing a shower of particles, some of which decay into muons. The elementary particles, which weigh around 200 times more than electrons, can very easily pass through any structure, even large and thick rocks like mountains. Researchers can use these tiny particles to measure the density of structures, just like X-rays pass through our bodies to visualise our skeleton.

Pictured is the results of one of the team's muography scans on the pyramid, which helped to reveal the new structure (SP-BV)

To find out more about the pyramid, researchers from countries including France and Japan began a project to scan the structure in October 2015.

The scientists made the discovery using cosmic-ray imaging, recording the behaviour of subatomic particles called muons that penetrate the rock.

Detectors were set up inside the pyramid, including in the so-called Queen's Chamber.

This allowed the pyramid's insides to be seen without physically disturbing it, as the results showed empty space differently from rock.

To find out more about the pyramid, researchers from countries including France and Japan began a project to scan the structure in October 2015. Researchers placed detectors in two rooms within the pyramid to collect subatomic particles as they fell from the sky, revealing the structure of the building like an X-ray reveals bone

WHAT THEY FOUND An apparent void lying undiscovered deep inside the Great Pyramid of Giza has been discovered by scientists. The internal structure is located above the Grand Gallery - that links two of the pyramid's chambers. It traces a similar route for at least 30 metres (100ft). While the precise design and purpose of the space is unknown, it was hailed by the team of academics as the biggest discovery inside the Giza landmark since the 19th century. 'This was a study about physics, it was not about Egyptology - we are not claiming anything about interpretation for this void - we are just claiming that there is a void and that's all,' study author Mehdi Tayoubi said. Despite the breakthrough, the newly discovered structure has yet to be reached in person by any researcher.

The presence of the space, dubbed the ScanPyramids Big Void, was confirmed using three different detection technologies over several months after first being spotted, the paper said.

The results were then analysed three times.

The ScanPyramids mission is made up of researchers from Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities, the University of Cario, and the non-profit organisation the Heritage Innovation Preservation (HIP) Institute.

The team employed by-products of the cosmic ray known as muons that are only partially absorbed by stone and take noticeably different trajectories through air

HOW ARE SCIENTISTS PEERING INSIDE THE PYRAMIDS Over the course of their lengthy study, the team have used several techniques to scan Egyptian pyramids. Infrared thermography - Infrared detects infrared energy emitted from object, converts it to temperature, and displays an image of its temperature distribution to reveal objects that may be hidden. 3D scans with lasers - Lasers bounce narrow pulses of light off the interiors of a structure to map it in detail. Once the scanning is complete, the data can be combined into a highly detailed 3-D model. Cosmic-ray detectors - This detects muons that are created when cosmic rays hit the atmosphere. Muons pass harmlessly through people and buildings. Muons traveling through rock or other dense material will slow and eventually stop. The idea is to catch the muons after theyve passed through an pyramid and measure their energies and trajectories. Researchers can then compile a 3D image that reveals hidden chambers.

'ScanPyramids Big Void is not a room or a chamber - we don't know if it is horizontal or inclined if it is composed by one or several successive structures, but it's big,' report author Mehdi Tayoubi, president and co-founder of the HIP Institute, told MailOnline.

'The Grand Gallery is an internal spectacular internal structure (47m long, 8m high) a kind of internal cathedral at the centre of the pyramid.

'This Big Void, with same size characteristics as the Grand Gallery, could be successive chambers, a tunnel. Many hypotheses are possible.'

Despite the breakthrough, the newly discovered structure has yet to be reached in person by any researcher.

Detectors were set up inside the pyramid, including in the so-called Queen's Chamber. This allowed the pyramid's insides to be visualised without physically disturbing it, as the results showed empty space differently from rock

Report author Mr Tayoubi said: 'This structure is not accessible, we don't see (that) people tried, if you look at the Grand Gallery, to access the void which is above.

'So this void was hidden, I think, since the construction of the pyramid, it was not accessible.

'We needed this technique - the right technique at the right time - to be able to identify it and discover it.'

He added they were 'very confident' the results were correct.

Because no one has physically seen inside the void, what it was built for remains a mystery.

'This finding is very exciting, but I don't think it's likely to be some kind of secret chamber,' Dr Kate Spence, an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the study, told the Telegraph.

'I think it is an inclined ramp that was used to transport huge blocks into the centre of the pyramid and then left. The orientation leads up to the huge granite roof struts at the top of the relieving chamber.

Muon detectors (artist's impression) placed in known rooms within the Great Pyramid picked up the subatomic particles as they passed through layers of stone, meaning the scientists could map the pyramid without breaking through its walls

Researchers from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities' scientific committee suggest it could be a 'construction gap' - part of a trench that allowed workers to access the Grand Gallery and King's Chamber while the rest of the pyramid was built.

More simply, the void may have simply been left there to relieve weight from the Grand Gallery below.

The finding opens up the possibility that the void could be linked to other different and undiscovered structures within the pyramid, the study claimed.

Crucially, the authors said, it could provide a method by which scientists can finally start to piece together how the pyramid was built.

The presence of the void, dubbed the ScanPyramids Big Void, was confirmed using three different muon detection technologies over several months after first being spotted, the paper said. Pictured is the pyramid's descending main entrance hallway. The new structure is above this entrance-way

THE SCANPYRAMIDS PROJECT After muon detectors detect voids within a pyramid, the team often use thermal imaging scans (pictured) to confirm their finds The team's finding has been a long time coming after months spent trying to find the elusive 'void'. The researchers began using muon technology, thermal scanning and 3D laser mapping to lay out the pyramid's internal structure in 2015. Scanners placed in the Great Pyramid's grand descending corridor, as well as a tunnel near the north facing entrance dug out by medieval explorers, found a small structure above the structure's entrance in 2016. Thermal imaging of the pyramid confirmed a human-height, corridor-shaped void that ran parallel but above to the descending corridor. Researchers realised this corridor, labelled the ScanPyramid Northfacing Corridor, must lead somewhere, and spent the following months using mapping technology to find where it led. This has now led the team to the new structure, which sits above the pyramid's Grand Gallery.

They added that the development 'show how modern particle physics can shed new light on the world's archaeological heritage'.

'This was a study about physics, it was not about Egyptology - we are not claiming anything about interpretation for this void - we are just claiming that there is a void and that's all,' Mr Tayoubi said.

Muon detectors have previously been used to map out the inside of the Fukushima's nuclear reactor in Japan and it is hoped they can be used to explore other archaeological sites.

The detectors work by using cosmic particles known as muons that have the power to penetrate deeply into most materials.

Despite the breakthrough, the newly discovered structure has yet to be reached in person by any researcher. Experts used several types of muon detector, which reads subatomic particles as they rain down from the sky, for their study

The finding opens up the possibility that the void could be linked to other different and undiscovered structures within the pyramid, the study claimed. Pictured is a virtual reality layout of what we know of the pyramid's internal structures so far, including the newly found structure, pictured as white dots next to the King's chamber

THE PYRAMID OF GIZA The Great Pyramid, also known as Khufu's Pyramid, is the sole survivor of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World For more than 4,500 years, Egypt's pyramids have kept their secrets hidden deep within the labyrinth of passages and chambers that lie inside their towering stone structures. But the long-running row over whether the Great Pyramid of Giza is hiding a network of previously undiscovered tunnels behind its stone walls has now been answered. The researchers confirmed the find using cosmic particles known as muons to scan the Great Pyramid of Giza. They used the scans to create maps to reveal the internal structure of the 479 feet (146m) high pyramid. Last year thermal scanning identified a major anomaly in the Great Pyramid, the largest and oldest of the pyramids at Giza and one of the seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Those scans identified three adjacent stones at its base which registered higher temperatures than others. Those scans identified three adjacent stones at its base which registered higher temperatures than others. This led to theories that they may be hiding a secret chamber that had yet to be discovered. A team of experts then set up the ScanPyramid's project to use muons, tiny subatomic particle that are typically produced by cosmic rays smash into atoms on Earth, to peer through the pyramid's huge stone blocks, some of which weight up to 15 tons. Dr Hawass has in the past been sceptical of the usefulness of conducting such scans. He recently clashed publicly with British Egyptologists over their theory that a secret burial chamber may be hidden behind the walls of Tutankhamun's tomb in his pyramid in the Valley of the Kings.

Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza has been shrouded in mystery for millennia, but now a long-held secret of its structure might be known thanks to particle physics. The pyramid borders what is now El Giza in Egypt

The subatomic particles require only a few special instruments because they rain down naturally from the atmosphere above.

Some archaeologists have pinned hopes on using the sophisticated technology to locate the burial place of the legendary queen Nefertiti (pictured)

Muons are created when the upper atmosphere reacts with cosmic rays, producing a shower of particles, some of which decay into muons.

The elementary particles, which weigh around 200 times more than electrons, can very easily pass through any structure, even large and thick rocks like mountains.

Researchers can use these tiny particles to measure the density of structures, just like X-rays pass through our bodies to visualise our skeleton.

GREAT PYRAMID'S CURSED TOMB REOPENED Yesterday it was reported that archaeologists in Egypt have reopened a 'cursed tomb' containing the remains of the people who built the Great Pyramid of Giza to visitors. It is the first time it has been opened to the public since its discovery almost 30 years ago. The area dates back 4,500 years and is located in the 'tribal mountain' area, near the Pyramid of Giza. The Press Office of the Ministry of Antiquities shared the revelation on Instagram with a picture of the area, saying 'Opening the workers cemetery site at Giza Plateau to visit'. Yesterday it was reported that archaeologists in Egypt have reopened a 'cursed tomb' (pictured) containing the remains of the people who built the Great Pyramid of Giza to visitors The newly opened area contains a cemetery of workers along with the graves of the supervisor of the royal palace, the supervisor of the construction workers and a man of significance who was buried with the workers, accordingto Newsweek. The site has been closed off since 1990. Archaeologists from the Ministry of Antiquities believe the man who supervised the workers filled the cemetery with curses to protect the dead from thieves.

This has now led the team to find the new structure, which sits above the pyramid's Grand Gallery.

Some archaeologists have pinned hopes on using the sophisticated technology to locate the burial place of the legendary queen Nefertiti.

The wife of King Akhenaten, who initiated a monotheistic cult in ancient Egypt, queen Nefertiti remains an enigma, best known for a bust depicting her that is now on exhibition in Berlin's Neues Museum.

A British Egyptologist, Nicholas Reeves, believed her remains were hidden in a secret chamber in the tomb of Tutankhamun, in the southern Valley of the Kings.

In 2015, archaeologists scanned the tomb with radar hoping to find clues.

Both Reeves's theory and the inconclusive results have been dismissed by other Egyptologists.

One of them, former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass, said that an adept of the sun god Aton would never have been allowed to be buried in the Valley of the Kings."

Al Sharpton addressed news that the alleged assault against actor Jussie Smollett appears to not be how it was originally reported by TMZ last month.

The star of the television program Empire has claimed that he was the victim of a hate crime that included attackers who put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him all while wearing red hats saying MAGA. But over the weekend Chicago police revealed that not only has that story fallen apart, but strongly suggested that Smollett had engineered the attack as a hoax and the two attackers were two Nigerian brothers paid by the actor to stage the attack.

When initial reports broke, Sharpton claimed “we should come with all that we can come within law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum.” Now that the story appears to be very different, Sharpton “still maintain(s) that.” And if it is found that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetrate something that is not true, they ought to “face accountability to the maximum.”

Sharpton went on to talk about the confusion surrounding this very strange news report, before finishing with the very awkward double negative claim of “We cannot not get to the truth here.”

McCABE SAYS DEPUTY AG ROSENSTEIN 'ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS' ABOUT SECRETLY RECORDING TRUMP: The former FBI deputy director said in an interview broadcast Sunday that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ""was not joking"" when he suggested secretly recording President Donald Trump in the Oval Office following the May 2017 dismissal of FBI Director James Comey.

McCabe, speaking to CBS News' ""60 Minutes,"" recounted a conversation soon after Comey's firing about the ongoing Russia investigation in which he said Rosenstein told him: ""I never get searched when I go into the White House. I could easily wear a recording device. They wouldn't know it was there.""

""Now, he was not joking,"" McCabe said of Rosenstein's comments. ""He was absolutely serious. And in fact, he brought it up in the next meeting we had.""

CORY BOOKER 'WITHHOLDING JUDGMENT ON SMOLLETT CASE AFTER CALLING IT 'ATTEMPTED MODERN-DAY LYNCHING': Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker told reporters Sunday that he would withhold judgment on the alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett after calling the incident ""an attempted modern-day lynching"" when it was first reported last month ... Booker cited the deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue this past October as well as the June 2015 shooting at a historically black church in Charleston, S.C.

""I’m gonna withhold until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources,"" the senator from New Jersey said after meeting with voters in Rochester, N.H. ""We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise in a serious way, and we actually even know-- in this country-- that since 9/11, the majority of the terrorist attacks on our soil have been right-wing terrorist attacks -- the majority of them white supremacist attacks.""

RUSH LIMBAUGH: SPENDING BILL WAS EFFORT BY SOME REPUBLICANS TO SABOTAGE TRUMP: Conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" charged that the compromise spending bill recently signed by President Trump to avert another partial government shutdown was little more than a disguised effort by some Republicans to torpedo his 2020 presidential candidacy...The radio host rejected claims that Trump is unduly influenced by right-wing media figures and ""wackos"" -- an accusation that resurfaced amid the ongoing border wall funding dispute.

""Both parties have people that are still trying to get rid of Donald Trump,"" Limbaugh said, asserting that Democrats are also working to guarantee a ""permanent underclass of voters"" who are ""uneducated"" and ""don't even speak"" English.

BILL DE BLASIO CORRECTS OCASIO-CORTEZ'S CLAIMS ABOUT SPENDING AMAZON TAX BREAK MONEY: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested on Sunday that critics of the potential Amazon campus New York City — such as Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — got the facts wrong over the money behind the tax breaks ... The Democratic mayor said: “And that $3 billion that would go back in tax incentives was only after we were getting the jobs and getting the revenue.”

On Sunday morning, de Blasio responded in the affirmative when Chuck Todd of NBC News’ “Meet the Press” asked if the tax breaks offered to Amazon weren’t “money you had over here. And it was going over there.”

And by the way, the president knew that something was amiss, he’d been saying from the very beginning, something’s going on within in the FBI, something’s wrong within my justice department. He knew and everybody said, “oh, he’s crazy.” No, he wasn’t. This is exactly the thing that he was talking about happening.

A world-renowned British photographer who specialises in capturing images of the world's insects has turned his attention to animals that have been encased in amber for millions of years.

The animals were found along Latvia's Baltic coast an date back between 40 and 45 million years ago.

Levon Bliss, from London and now based in Wiltshire, has published stunning images of ten insects that died when walking along fledgling tree branches after getting trapped in sap.

The sap trapped the unfortunate animals and, over time, hardened to form amber.

Amber preserves the animals in their original condition and its translucent appearance allows the entombed animals within to then be studied.

A park-winged fungus gnat (pictured) that died between 40-45 million years and was discovered in the Baltic region is one of the ten limited edition prints. Levon Bliss, from London and now based in Wiltshire, published stunning images of the insects using his unique method

This image of an ant encapsulated within translucent Amber is created from thousands of separate images using microscope lenses. The specimen is dated between 40-45 million years

WHAT IS AMBER? Amber has been used in jewelry for thousands of years, and is often found to hold remarkably well-preserved materials from eras long since passed. The golden-coloured translucent substance is formed when resin from extinct coniferous trees became hardened and then fossilised. Often insects, plant material, pollen and other creatures became trapped in the resin, causing them to be entombed within after it solidified. Advertisement

Mr Bliss has released several photography books capturing insects, given TED talks on 'macrophotography' and sells limited edition prints of his work.

The amber-encased insects were polished by Mr Bliss and placed in a liquid with a refractive index similar to that of the amber.

This helps reduce the scattering and 'bending' of light as it travels from one medium to another - such as through air and into water.

If two materials have a significantly different refractive index, light slows down when moving between them and this distorts the image - it is the same phenomena as when a a straw is placed in a cup of water and appears to bend.

By suspending the object in the liquid, light used to illuminate the amber is prevented from 'bouncing around at different angles'.

The images are on sale at Mr Bliss' website and range from £500 to £650 ($645 to $840).

Prints include images of a lace beetle, a fungus gnat and an an ancient spider beetle.

The sources say police are keeping an eye on two brothers arrested and released in the case, because they want to make sure the Empire star doesn't contact them. Sources tell the Chicago Tribune that police suspect Smollett paid the Nigerian brothers to stage an alleged attack on him last month. Police said Saturday that information from the brothers had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"" and they had requested a ""follow-up interview"" with Smollett. The actor says he was attacked Jan. 27 by two men shouting racist and homophobic insults who put a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Sunday that the interview had not been conducted yet, the AP reports. ""We're not confirming, denying, or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten."" According to TMZ's sources, when police searched the men's apartment, they found two magazines with letters cut out, and they are investigating whether there is a connection to a threatening letter with cut-out letters that Smollett says he received before the attack. One source also says police found it hard to believe one attacker shouted ""This is MAGA country,"" because ""not a single Trump supporter watches Empire."" (Read more Jussie Smollett stories.)

Asked if Francis had suffered any ill effects from the fall, a Vatican spokesman, Greg Burke, said 'the pope is fine.'

Czestochowa Archbishop Waclaw Depo said Francis fell because he had closed his eyes and appeared to miss a step.

'He is in good condition. He did not even complain at all. He never said a word,' Depo said. 'Also the homily showed that the pope has strength and this strength he gets from the people.'

Francis enjoys relatively good health, despite putting in long days of ceremonies, audiences and meetings. In his youth, he had a section of one lung removed.

A few times in the past, Francis has missed a step or even fallen on stairs. Each time he has got up on his own or thanks to an aide lending a hand, then carried on without missing a beat for the rest of the long ceremonies.

The Pope was at the monastery, home to an ancient Catholic icon believed to work miracles, ahead of a trip by tram to meet young pilgrims from around the world.

Outdoors, the Argentine said Mass for a congregation numbering in the tens of thousands, thanking Poles for holding on to their faith in difficult times.

He also praised native son St. John Paul II as a 'meek and powerful' herald of mercy as well as countless 'ordinary yet remarkable people' who held firm to their Catholic faith throughout adversity in the former Communist-ruled nation.

The Pontiff, in Krakow to headline an international Catholic youth extravaganza, travelled to the southern city to pray before the legendary Black Madonna.

Security was tight at the hill-top shrine following a series of attacks in Europe, with a highly visible police and army presence on the roads leading into the city, where hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were gathered.

Francis hopped in an open-topped pope mobile for a tour through the cheering crowds.

'We slept so little, but it's worth it, what an atmosphere!' said pilgrim Kate Tor, whose young sons were among the thousands of children who had camped out on the sweeping avenue leading to the monastery.

Teenagers still wrapped in sleeping bags, elderly couples perched on folding chairs outside tents and families with Francis-themed balloons were serenaded by the Argentine pope's favourite tango music before his arrival.

Ambulances and fire-engines were on standby with Polish officials taking no chances with security following the jihadist murder of a priest in a French church on the eve of the five-day trip to celebrate the 2016 World Youth Day.

Arriving on Wednesday, the Argentine said the world was at war but argued that religion was not the cause, insisting the way for people to 'overcome fear' was to provide asylum to those fleeing war and persecution.

He led a mass to mark the 1050th anniversary of Poland's Catholic faith at the monastery.

The Black Madonna has been venerated since 1711, when the bubonic plague decimated Warsaw's population but stopped dead when it reached the Jasna Gora monastery in the south of the country.

Since then the figure, which legend has it was painted by Saint Luke the apostle, has been hailed as miraculous.

Two scars on the Madonna's face were reportedly inflicted during an attempted robbery in 1430, with the petrified thieves turning tail and fleeing when blood poured from the torn painting.

Francis was due to return to Krakow after the mass, where he will be presented with the keys to the city by the mayor, before jumping on to a tram which will whisk him to the sprawling Blonia meadow for his first big WYD event.

Some 15 disabled youngsters and their families will take the tram with the pontiff to the welcome ceremony, where hundreds of thousands of people will have spent the day being entertained by singers and dancers.

The pontiff had called for a minute's silence on Wednesday evening for a Polish volunteer, Maciej Szymon Cieslam, who was to have travelled with him on the tram, but had died at the start of the month after a battle with cancer.

At his first evening appearance at the window of the archbishop's palace in Krakow, he told the thousands of youngsters gathered below that Ciesla was getting ready to party with them at the WYD in spirit.

'Now go and do your duty, make noise all night long!' he finished with a grin.

Francis urged today's Poles to stay united even as their nation is divided over the issue of refugees and migrants, especially those who aren't Christians. He prayed that Poles would have 'the desire to leave behind all past wrongs and wounds, and to build fellowship for all, without ever yielding to the temptation to withdraw or to domineer.'"

*Since the last time we checked in on Jussie Smollett, things have seemingly gone from bad to worse. Now it’s being reported that a grand jury will hear the actor’s case early next week.

Law enforcement sources connected to the investigation say the 2 Nigerian Brothers (Abel & Ola Osundairo) who were arrested and then released are staying somewhere around the Loop in downtown Chicago under the watchful eye of police so no one (Jussie?) gets to them.

Here MORE via TMZ:

We’re told when police raided the home of the 2 brothers they found magazines with pages torn out, and authorities are now trying to determine if the missing pages are connected to the threatening letter that was sent to Jussie 8 days before the alleged attack.

Our sources say early on they asked Jussie if he’d sign complaints against the 2 men who attacked him and he was clear that he would. But, when he found out the 2 brothers were the ones in custody we’re told he said he knew them, felt bad for them and declined to sign the complaints.

Our sources say although cops believe the brothers purchased the rope that was around Jussie’s neck after the incident, there is no surveillance video at the hardware store because it erases after a week.

We’re told the way they tracked the 2 brothers down was by their movements in arriving and leaving the scene around Jussie’s apartment building. As we reported, they left in either a cab or an Uber, but we’re told cops tracked the vehicle and the 2 brothers got out on their way home and into another vehicle. As one source put it, “It was almost like a bad spy movie.”

The sources say there were red flags from the get-go. Cops were extremely suspiciouswhen Jussie took them out to the area where he said he was attacked and pointed to an obscure camera saying how happy he was that the attack was on video. Turns out the camera was pointing in the wrong direction. Cops thought it was weird he knew the location of that camera.

And, there’s this. We’re told investigators didn’t believe the 2 alleged attackers screamed, “This is MAGA country,” because, “Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire.'”

And, a few loose ends … we’re told when cops picked up the 2 brothers at O’Hare Airport, police were armed with 3 warrants for each man, one of which was to seize their phones.

We’re also told there is no video of a “rehearsal” of the attack in the street.

As we reported earlier, Smollett and his legal team have vehemently denied the attack was staged. They still maintain it was a hate crime."

Girls with large headpieces made from the hair of their ancestors and wearing intricately patterned dresses danced in isolated villages in southwest China to celebrate the Lunar New Year.

Against a stunning mountain backdrop, dozens of girls and women of the Long Horn Miao ethnicity performed for the annual flower festival or 'Tiaohuajie', held in Guizhou province on Thursday.

Onlookers watched - smartphones in hand - as the women swirled across a meadow, wearing dresses and jackets embroidered with pink roses and geometric patterns.

But it was the towering black headdresses of the dancers that really stood out - made from wool, string and the hair of their ancestors, and wrapped around animal horns with white fabric.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had “shifted” — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again. Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police “are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

“And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,” Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push “the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.”

The response from Smollett’s celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn’t know what to say, but that the situation is a “mess” and a “travesty.”

“I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

“I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,” Gay wrote. “Because more often than not they are telling the truth.” CC

He said police reached out to Smollett's attorneys to request another interview with him. Guglielmi said Sunday the interview hadn't been conducted yet.

A source close to the investigation tells CBS News two Nigerian brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, told detectives Smollett paid them to participate in the attack. They said they bought rope that was found around Smollett's neck at a nearby hardware store. A raid of their home turned up ropes, masks and bleach.

Sources told CBS Chicago the brothers rehearsed the assault with Smollett.

Guglielmi declined to comment on reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case

""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he said.

He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor was ""angered and devastated"" and felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Brothers say Jussie Smollett paid them to participate in alleged attack, source says

The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police. ""At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels,"" the statement said.

""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the statement added.

The other brother played a prisoner in season two of ""Empire.""

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

Both brothers apparently left Chicago on the day of the alleged attack. On Wednesday, Chicago police picked them up at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim.

Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who's also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

The “Empire” actor and singer, 36, has teamed up with the Trevor Project, a well-known LGBTQ advocacy group, for its “How to Save a Life” campaign, unveiled Monday. Smollett appears in a video aimed at encouraging supporters to apply to become volunteer crisis counselors for TrevorText and TrevorChat ― the group’s text and web chat support services for queer youth.

“It’s heartbreaking to think of the amount of LGBTQ youth out there who feel hopeless and alone, or think they don’t have support,” Smollett said in a press release. “Just one supportive person can decrease an LGBTQ youth’s risk of suicide by 30 percent, and The Trevor Project is giving everyone the amazing opportunity to be that person.”

In June, AT&T announced it would contribute $1 million to the Trevor Project ― the largest reported donation in the group’s history ― as part of a multi-year “Turn Up The Love” initiative.

LGBTQ youths remain nearly three times as susceptible to suicidal behavior as their heterosexual-identifying peers. An estimated 34 percent of queer kids have also said they face bullying in school ― which is why having outspoken role models like Smollett matters more than ever, Trevor Project CEO and executive director Amit Paley told HuffPost.

“It’s so important for LGBTQ young people to see that they have support in and out of the home,” Paley said. “We hope to encourage more people to volunteer with Trevor to support the growing number of LGBTQ youth in crisis reaching out to us for help.”

CHICAGO -- Chicago police and representatives for Jussie Smollett weren't speaking publicly about the investigation into a reported attack on the Empire actor a day after authorities said the case had ""shifted"" and they wanted to interview Smollett again.

Detectives are following up on information provided by the brothers while they were in custody for two days last week, the source said.

Investigators also have been given new details about the rope that Smollett said was made into a noose and placed around his neck as he walked toward his apartment in the 300 block of East North Water Street, the source said.

Detectives had been searching area retailers to find the source of the rope but the new information allowed them to narrow their search and find where it was sold, the source said.

The brothers, 25 and 27, were released without charges late Friday, 12 hours after police had called them “possible suspects.”

Detectives still need to verify their stories and the investigation was continuing. Chicago police announced Saturday that investigators hope to interview Smollett soon.

The actor issued a strongly worded statement late Saturday insisting the attack happened.

“Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” read the statement from his attorneys. “He has been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth.”

The statement said one of the brothers was Smollett’s personal trainer, the first time he has acknowledged knowing either of them. The two also reportedly worked with Smollett on “Empire.”

A representative for the Fox network, which produces and airs the show, had no comment.

Efforts to reach the brothers were unsuccessful.

CHICAGO: Actor Jussie Smollett's case of homophobic attack will now come before a grand jury next week.

According to tmz.com, a panel will hear the case, but it is not clear who is facing charges or what they might be.

Last month, the ""Empire"" star told the police that he was attacked on January 29 by men who used ""racial and homophobic slurs"" against him.

Following an investigation, two brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo were arrested by the police who viewed them as ""potential suspects"", but they were released later due to lack of evidences.

Law enforcement sources told the publication that the men who were arrested and then released are staying somewhere around the Loop in downtown Chicago under the watchful eye of police so no one gets to them."

“Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation tell CNN that Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month,” reports CNN.

The story says “The [two] men, who are brothers, were arrested Wednesday but released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of ‘new evidence.’”

The article adds, “Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement to CNN Saturday night saying Smollett was angry about these latest developments: ‘As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

CHICAGO -- Chicago police and representatives for Jussie Smollett weren't speaking publicly about the investigation into a reported attack on the Empire actor a day after authorities said the case had ""shifted"" and they wanted to interview Smollett again.

Pamela Sharp, a spokesman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokesman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

The trajectory of the investigation ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett's attorney to request the follow-up interview with him.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area but were unable to find any footage of the attack. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" they said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew anger and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, Calif., saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was angry with people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Last week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on Empire, Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

An investigation into an alleged attack on an openly gay black actor has ""shifted"" and police are now seeking a follow-up interview with the Empire cast member, a spokesman said.

Jussie Smollett, 36, reported to the police on Jan 29 that two men had yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck while he walked downtown in Chicago.

The change in direction came two days after the police said the two ""potential suspects"" had been released without charge and as media outlets reported that the incident could have been staged.

""The information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview,"" he added.

Multiple media outlets reported that the two men are brothers who were arrested at Chicago's O'Hare airport upon their return from a trip to Nigeria.

At least one of the men reportedly worked on Empire, a TV series about the fortunes of a hip-hop mogul and his family battling over control of a multi-million-dollar music company.

In an emotional interview with ABC's Good Morning America, Smollett gave details of the purported attack and said he was angry at doubts about its veracity.

Initial reports of the attack shocked the entertainment industry and brought waves of support from advocacy groups and politicians."

Empire star Jussie Smollett has denied the Chicago police claims that he paid two Nigerian brothers to attack him.

While Chicago police try and determine whether Jussie Smollett orchestrated his alleged last attack last month, the FBI is still investigating the other incident involving Smollett, which could result in federal charges no matter what.

Two days before the alleged attack on Smollett, a letter containing white powder was sent to the set of ""Empire."" The substance was later determined to be aspirin.

Smollett described the letter during his ""Good Morning America"" interview with Robin Roberts, saying, ""It had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing toward it with the words that says Smollett Jussie, you will die.""

According to our sources, the FBI is investigating who sent the letter, regardless of whether or not the threat was legitimate or part an elaborate set-up involving Smollett.

Our sources say the feds are looking at both possibilities and are simply working to find out whoever sent the threatening letter, period.

We're told the possible charge would be ""mailing threatening communications,"" which states:

Whoever knowingly so deposits or causes to be delivered as aforesaid, any communication with or without a name or designating mark subscribed thereto, addressed to any other person and containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of the addressee or of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

Legally, if reports are true and somehow the letter send is a part of some hoax or setup, whoever is responsible can be arrested.

Jussie Smollett's legal team released a statement on Saturday night saying, ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.""

Chicago police said that there was no video footage from the incident, despite the area where the incident happened being full of cameras.

Two Nigerian men who were spotted walking around the area the day after the incident were taken in for questioning. They are both known to the actor.

It was then that speculation grew that Jussie had ""planned"" the attack, despite police saying they had no reason to believe this was the case.

Officials have only said they want to re-interview the actor.

News site Vox reports that the reports about the attack being staged create the impression that the media blindly accepted Jussie's version of events. This while police are still investigating the case and have stated Jussie is not being investigated.

Jussie himself has denied the idea that he paid people to attack him. He issued a statement through his legal team saying he would cooperate fully with law officials and that there was no truth to the idea that he was involved in any way.

And that's just recently. I walked away from the left long before all of this but man, how brainwashed and biased do you have to be to STILL blindly follow and believe everything the left spews out. I'm being serious here, I'm legitimately just dumbfounded at this point and can't wait to see the defence towards any of this. Click to expand...

There isn't a logical defense anyone can post for it all. people follow the left because they want the policies they advocate, or either do it because they are made dependent on handouts given to them that they are afraid of losing without them in power. ect. the left uses welfare as a political tool to buy votes from immigrants illegal or otherwise and minorities because they want them dependent on the government for the sake on controlling them with fear of losing their free stuff if Democrats are not in power. When in reality these people are made slaves to a big government system in that process and really do not even see it because ''Free stuff''They attack everything not far left and label them dangerous, crazy, radical , nazi's, racists, ect and cry for socialism to kill free markets in order to control distribution of wealth and turn america into a Socialist communist state governed by the elite for the elite by the elite. And many people are dumb enough to hand that power to them for the sake of false promises of a system that can never work and is proven to never work, for the promise of free shit that really never will be free. Everything comes at a price. Everything. Most people are just to self centered and narrow in thinking that what benefits them is all they care about. So they act and vote based on what they want more then what is overall best. The leftist media told people that Kavanaugh was basically evil incarnate so they believed it. the media sold the MAGA kids with the native thing like they did to cause a negative outburst reaction because that is what they do. They feed conflict for the sake of creating civil unrest and divide for the sake on political manipulation of the masses through media. The nazi's educated the world on how to do that and the world learned well. The media can be and is used daily as a propaganda tool to control what people believe. And most people believe what they are told because they think that the news wouldn't lie to them. But people in power with money who own the media corps have everything to gain by lying and controlling things with propaganda. The elite can control people by controlling what they believe and think. because for the most part society is full of emotional reactionary fools that will set cities on fire in three hours if you stir them up enough on the right thing.The left wants people fearful of the right, dependent on the Government completely, and want socialism for absolute control of the system and its people. They lost their shit when Trump won because he doesn't fit the political mold of Washington and thus is the ultimate disruption to things. And they want him gone. And will do and say anything to get him gone that is within their ability. They pretty much have tried about everything but throwing a fucking sink at him a this point lol.But the hard truth is the left is more like how Nazi's operated in how they act then anyone on the right is. Elitist holier then thou types, their way or fuck off kinda mindsets, attack and insult anyone that doesn't share their world views, Riot and spray people with pepper spray at university campus when a right wing speaker is there. Advocate illegal immigration instead of upholding laws. Calling for murderers to be spared death penalty yet are fine with innocent unborn children being murdered in the womb. ect. The only thing they don't do as a party that the Nazi's did is run a genocide plot against a certain group of people. But the nazi's didn't do that until they had absolute power and control because power like that corrupts absolutely. And only vain men or women thrive in absolute power systems of Government. people like Hitler and Stalin and others. Because they are merciless and manipulators and people are fickle and easy to control if you tell them what they want to hear and by the time they realize they are fucked it is too late and they are slaves to the machine and to resist is to die or be imprisoned.If a socialism system ever happened it would turn to a dictatorship within 10 to 15 years. and America as we know it would cease to exist as would free society in the west. Because if America goes that way its taking the world with it. And that cannot be allowed to happen."

Jussie Smollett, 36, reported to police on January 29 that two men beat him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck while he walked downtown in the third-largest American city.

The announced change in direction came two days after police said that the two ""potential suspects"" in the attack had been released without charge and as US media outlets reported that the attack may have been staged.

""The information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview,"" he added.

Multiple US media outlets reported the two men are brothers who were arrested at Chicago's O'Hare airport upon their return from a trip to Nigeria.

At least one of the men reportedly worked on Empire, a TV series about the fortunes of a hip-hop mogul and his family battling over control of a multi-million-dollar music company.

In an emotional interview with ABC's Good Morning America broadcast Thursday, February 14, Smollett gave details of the purported attack and said he was angry at doubts about its veracity.

Smollett said a masked man yelled Empire as the actor was walking through an intersection after a late-night stop at a sandwich shop.

After he ignored the man, Smollett said the attacker yelled out a racial slur and used President Donald Trump's campaign slogan acronym ""MAGA,"" which stands for ""Make America Great Again.""

Smollett said the man called Chicago ""MAGA country"" and then punched him in the face, at which point the actor fought with the attacker, and was kicked by a second man he had not noticed earlier.

""It felt like minutes, but it was probably like 30 seconds, honestly,"" Smollett said.

Initial reports of the attack shocked the entertainment industry and brought waves of support from advocacy groups and senior politicians, including Democratic presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand. — Rappler.com"

In video footage of nearby areas, two Nigerian men were identified by police, the day after the attack. Despite the area where Jussie was attacked being filled with cameras, none of them were working on the day of the incident.

The two men taken in for questioning are known to Jussie, with the one having played a brief role on Empire and the other being the actor's personal trainer for a while.

CBS reported that the two men told police that Jussie had ""paid them"" to orchestrate the attack on him.

Jussie released a statement through his attorney's denying that he had any involvement in his own attack saying that ""nothing is further from the truth.""

Chicago police said on Saturday that the investigation into the assault reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers questioned in the case. However, attorneys for the Empire actor blasted reports alleging he played a role in his own attack.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement on Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys later on Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt “victimised” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck, before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him."

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had “shifted” — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police “are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

“And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,” Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push “the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.”

The response from Smollett’s celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn’t know what to say, but that the situation is a “mess” and a “travesty.”

“I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

“I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,” Gay wrote. “Because more often than not they are telling the truth.”

Or how about being sad at the revelation that a University of Virginia fraternity did not rape a co-ed? Bizarre, right? Well, a similar strange reaction was expressed by Washington Post Editorial Board assistant Nana Efua Mumford on Sunday due to her finding out that the alleged Jussie Smollett hate crime was probably a hoax.

Her broken-hearted deep sadness over the probable fact that racist, homophobic, white Trump supporters did not attack Smollett was revealed in ""I doubted Jussie Smollett. It breaks my heart that I might be right"":

On Jan. 29, Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon, the openly gay heir to the show’s hip-hop record label throne, was allegedly attacked in a baroque hate crime. He told police that his attackers immediately identified him as a gay actor from “Empire,” then proceeded to yell racial and homophobic slurs, shout “this is MAGA country,” pour an unknown chemical on him and place a noose around his neck. The story has since become even more complicated: The Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers, one of whom said that he played a small part on “Empire,” about their possible role in the attack. As of this writing, the department is seeking to interview Smollett again; he has hired a criminal defense attorney.

So you should be relieved that this example of the hate you thought was out there actually didn't happen, right:

I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did. I know that there is a deep, dark racist history in Chicago and, if proved true, this would be just one more point on the list. I wanted to believe him with every fiber of my being, most of all because the consequences if he were lying were almost too awful to contemplate.

Please, please be true! I need for this hate crime to have happened in order to help validate my beliefs about white racist, homophobic Trump supporters!

Over the past few hours, there have been speculations that have confirmed my worst fears. Unnamed “police sources” have claimed that Smollett orchestrated the entire thing.

Horrible! Oh, how horrible that poor Jussie did not get attacked by MAGA people! It confirmed her worst fears:

If Smollett’s story is found to be untrue, it will cause irreparable damage to the communities most affected. Smollett would be the first example skeptics cite when they say we should be dubious of victims who step forward to share their experiences of racist hate crimes or sexual violence. The incident would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists. It would be the very embodiment of “fake news.”

Um, wouldn't a proper reaction would be relief at finding out there was less hate in the land than was originally thought? At any rate, she continued:

And that reason, more than any other, is why I need this story to be true, despite its ugliness and despite what it would say about the danger of the world I live in. The damage done would be too deep and long-lasting. This could be one tragedy that the Lyon family — and more importantly, the ordinary people who loved the show and invested in Smollett and his character — could never overcome.

You NEED this story to be true? What? You need to be confirmed in your belief about white racist, homophobic Trump supporters attacking a gay black man?

Exit question: Will Washington Post ""identity politics"" reporter Eugene Scott be equally as sad at learning this supposed ""hate crime"" is probably a hoax after loudly proclaiming it to be an absolute fact. And what about Postie Jonathan Capehart, who called the MAGA fable a ""fact""?"

TMZ also reports that the apartment of the two Nigerians which was searched by the cops had some suspicious evidence like torn magazine pages which is been suspected to have been used to send the threat notes to Jussie Smollett.

The source also reports the police thinks there have been red flags since the beginning of the investigation. For example, the police were surprised that when Jussie took them to the crime scene, he was able to show them the camera located at the spot where he was attacked.

The police in the United States of America are questioning the two people of interest involved in the assault case on Jussie Smollett. According to TMZ, the two men who are of Nigerian heritage were said to have flown out of the country the night after the attack on the Empire star. However, the said men returned to the US on Wednesday, February 13, 2019.

The police then took a swipe on the residence of the two men and a number of items of special interest including 5 bottles of bleach, a red hat, 2 laptops, and others were seized by the police.

The two Nigerians are said to have been extras on the TV series Empire. Chicago PD has confirmed that the 2 men taken in for questioning are the same men in the surveillance video screen grab. The PD confirms transportation records, along with interviews with Jussie and other witnesses, led to the ID of the 2 men.

In the wake of the assault on 'Empire' star, Jussie Smollett, the police have released photos of two people of interest who might have questions to answer. PEOPLE reports that the police has released photographs of two people they wish to question in relation to the alleged assault on Jussie Smollett.

The Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi released an update on the case, revealing how investigators have acquired footage that could lead to the arrests of the Empire actor’s assailants.

“Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t,” DuVernay tweeted today.

African-American teen McDonald was fatally shot by Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014. The officer responded after someone reported a man — later identified as 17-year-old McDonald — was breaking into cars. Van Dyke shot the teen 16 times and was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery.

DuVernay frequently addresses civil rights issues and just recently wrapped production on the Central Park Five limited series for Netflix about five Harlem teenagers wrongly convicted, first in the media and then twice in the courts, for the 1989 rape of a jogger in the New York City park.

Her comments came in response to a Jan. 29 incident, in which Smollett told Chicago police he was walking down the street when two men started yelling racial and homophobic slurs, then beat him, doused him with a chemical and wrapped a rope around his neck.

However, the CPD said yesterday “the trajectory of the investigation” had shifted onto Smollett himself, after investigators questioned two Nigerian brothers they arrested Wednesday, and later released without charges.

“The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” a law enforcement official close to the Chicago PD probe told Deadline.

Smollett’s attorneys insisted Saturday that the Empire star is telling the truth, saying the actor is “angered and devastated” by the direction the case has taken.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” said defense lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson in a statement obtained by Deadline.

But civil rights activists in Los Angeles aren’t convinced Smollett has been completely forthcoming. On Sunday they held a press conference outside an LAPD station, and called on the actor to apologize, saying his statements have caused damage to the African-American and LGBTQ communities.

“Jussie Smollett put people’s lives at risk and could have created a situation that was much more damaging to those who are African-American and those who do identify with the LGBTQ community,” stated Project Islamic Hope Director and CEO Najee Ali.

“We have many members of the black community and the LGBTQ community who have been the victims of hate crimes. So for Smollett to say that he was a victim of racism and hate crimes — and we believe that is a lie — certainly is an injustice to those true victims of racism and hate crimes,” Ali added.

While the activist is basing his statements on media reports, he said he believes Smollett should be prosecuted for allegedly filing a false police report.

“Jussie Smollett must be brought to justice for lying,” Ali said. “We believed Smollett at the beginning. We gave him the benefit of the doubt, but over the last few days, we’ve seen this campaign of lies by Smollett continue to be unraveled.”"

Latest: California sues Trump over emergency declaration

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California’s attorney general has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s emergency declaration to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Xavier Becerra released a statement Monday saying 16 states — including California — allege the Trump administration’s action violates the Constitution.

Joining in filing the lawsuit are the attorneys general of Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Virginia.

Becerra says there is no emergency at the border.

Trump declared a national emergency to fulfill his promise of completing the wall.

The move allows the president to bypass Congress to use money from the Pentagon and other budgets.

California has repeatedly challenged Trump in court. Becerra has filed at least 45 lawsuits against the administration

MIAMI (AP) — Venezuela’s embattled president, Nicolas Maduro, is rejecting President Donald Trump’s call for a new day in Venezuela and comparing the tone of the American president’s speech in Miami to that of a Nazi.

Trump said Monday that the U.S. stands behind opposition leader Juan Guaido and condemns Maduro and his government’s socialist policies. Trump pleaded with Venezuela’s military to support Guaido and warned of dire consequences for standing with Maduro.

Maduro responded to Trump in comments broadcast on state television. He accused the U.S. president of speaking in an “almost Nazi style” and lashed out at Trump for thinking he can deliver orders to Venezuela’s military.

Maduro said, “Who is the commander of the armed forces, Donald Trump from Miami?” and added, “They think they’re the owners of the country.”

BEIRUT (AP) — The International Rescue Committee says more than 60 people have died in recent weeks after making their way out of the last area controlled by the Islamic State group in eastern Syria.

Spokesman Paul Donohoe says exhaustion and malnutrition are the principle causes of the deaths. He said Monday that at least 62 people died, two thirds of them children under the age of one. He says they either died along the way or soon after arriving at the camp.

Over 30,000 people who left the last IS-held areas have arrived at the al-Hol camp in Syria’s northern Hassakeh province in the last few weeks, raising the overall population of the camp to almost 42,000.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Businesses and government offices are slowly reopening in Haiti after more than a week of violent demonstrations.

People began lining up to buy food, water and gas and public transportation resumed on Monday in the capital of Port-au-Prince. Crews were clearing barricaded streets where tens of thousands of Haitians had protested to demand the resignation of President Jovenel Moise amid anger over rising prices and and allegations of government corruption.

Moise has refused to step down, though his Prime Minister Jean-Henry Ceant said over the weekend some government budgets would be cut by 30 percent, and he vowed to investigate alleged misspending tied to a Venezuelan program that provided Haiti with subsidized oil.

However, schools remained closed on Monday amid concerns of more violence.

Leslie McCrae Dowless appeared before the state elections board Tuesday, which is holding a hearing over what happened in last year’s 9th congressional district race. Dowless is accused of using illegal methods to boost the number of mail-in ballots going to Republican Mark Harris. Harris holds a slim lead over Democrat Dan McCready in the country’s last undecided congressional election.

Dowless’ attorney told the elections board he won’t testify without a legal protection against prosecution for events he describes. The board refused.

The race wasn’t certified, but the elections board is expected to either declare a winner or order a new election after the hearing.

TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE-STONE

Roger Stone apologizes to judge for Instagram post about her

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s longtime confidant Roger Stone has apologized to the judge presiding over his criminal case for an Instagram post featuring a photo of her with what appears to be the crosshairs of a gun.

Stone and his lawyers filed a notice Monday night saying Stone recognized “the photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted.”

Earlier Monday, Stone posted a photo of U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson with what appeared to be crosshairs near her head.

Stone later said that the picture had been “misinterpreted” and that any suggestion he intended to threaten Jackson was “categorically false.”

Stone is charged with lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering related to discussions he had during the 2016 election about WikiLeaks. He has denied guilt.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT-ROSENSTEIN

Official: Deputy AG Rosenstein expected to depart in March

WASHINGTON (AP) — A Justice Department official says Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is expected to leave his position in the middle of next month.

The official was not authorized to discuss the move by name and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Monday night.

The White House is expected to name a replacement for Rosenstein this week.

Rosenstein’s departure had been expected with the confirmation of William Barr as attorney general last week.

Rosenstein has been on the job for nearly two years.

He oversaw special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation after then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself. Barr now oversees the remaining work in Mueller’s investigation into potential coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign and decide how much Congress and the public know about its conclusion.

ELECTION 2020-TRUMP THE PUNDIT

Trump the pundit handicaps 2020 Democratic contenders

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Kamala Harris had the best campaign roll-out. Amy Klobuchar’s snowy debut showed grit. Elizabeth Warren’s opening campaign video was a bit odd. Take it from an unlikely armchair pundit sizing up the 2020 Democratic field: President Donald Trump.

Presidents traditionally ignore their potential opponents, but not Trump. He’s eager to shape the debate, sow discord and help position himself for the general election.

In tweets, public remarks and private conversations, Trump is making clear he is closely following the campaign to challenge him on the ballot in 2020. Facing no serious primary opponent of his own, he is establishing himself as an in-their-face observer of the Democratic Party’s nominating process — and he’s not being coy about weighing in.

ISRAEL-SPACE

First private Israel lunar mission to be launched this week

YEHUD, Israel (AP) — An Israeli nonprofit says it’ll launch what it hopes will be the first private spacecraft to land on the moon this week.

SpaceIL and state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries told reporters on Monday that the landing craft, dubbed Beresheet, or Genesis, will ship from Florida, where, propelled by a SpaceX Falcon rocket launch, it will commence its months-long voyage to the moon.

The launch is due late Thursday in U.S., early Friday in Israel. It had been originally slated for last December.

The small craft, roughly the size of a washing machine, will have to make several orbits before landing.

Israel’s space program chief Avi Blasberger says he hopes it will create a “Beresheet effect” in Israel, akin to the Apollo effect, to promote science for a new generation of Israelis.

EMPIRE CAST MEMBER-ATTACK

No plan for Smollett to do follow-up police interview Monday

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorneys for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives Monday for a follow-up interview about his reported assault.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

Chicago police have said they still want to do a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett about a reported attack that the 'Empire' star said included his assailants yelling racial and homophobic slurs, after saying earlier that the investigation had 'shifted' after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges

A grand jury is slated to hear the Jussie Smollett case next week, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation into the Empire actor's alleged hoax attack, though Guglielmi said he couldn't comment on whether a grand jury may hear evidence in the case.

Chicago police insiders told TMZ that authorities are keeping a close eye on two Nigerian brothers, who were arrested and questioned about the attack before being released on Friday, to make sure that Smollett doesn't try to contact them.

Investigators have said they believe Smollett may have paid Empire extras Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo $3,500 to assault him in an orchestrated, rehearsed attack on January 29.

Sources say Smollett initially agreed to sign complaints against his assailants, but declined to do so once he heard that Abel and Ola were the men in custody because he knew them and felt bad for them.

Reports of a possible grand jury emerged hours after the Chicago Police Department said Smollett was not yet being considered an official suspect, despite insider claims to the contrary.

'We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with the Empire cast member before we can answer this question,' CPD said in a statement to TMZ.

'After new developments, we've reached out to his attorney and requested additional time to interview him.'

Smollett has furiously denied claims that he orchestrated the assault and said 'nothing could be further from the truth'.

Inside sources told TMZ there will be a grand jury convened next week to decide whether to file formal charges against Smollett's alleged attackers. Reports of the grand jury came just after it was claimed that two Nigerian brothers Jussie Smollett is accused of paying $3,500 to attack him, Abimbola 'Abel' (left) and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo (right), allegedly told police that the trio rehearsed the assault beforehand. The two are shown in an image from their joint Instagram page, which was shared in March of 2018

Smollett (above four days after the attack) had claimed that the assailants 'yelled out racial and homophobic slurs' as they tied a rope around his neck and poured an unknown substance that he suspected was bleach on him

Abel and Ola reportedly told detectives that the 2am attack was supposed to happen earlier and that they did a practice run beforehand, according to CBS Chicago.

Sources said one of the brothers put a rope around Smollett's neck and poured bleach over him while the other wore a red hat and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

THE FULL STATEMENT FROM JUSSIE SMOLLETT’S ATTORNEYS Lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson issued the following statement on Jussie's behalf on Saturday night: 'As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. 'One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. 'Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to “unnamed” sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.' Advertisement

The brothers, who reportedly had a relationship with Smollett and were extras on Empire, told authorities they had bought the items used in the attack at the actor's direction.

Smollett had told police that on January 29, two assailants tied a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him while yelling 'Empire f****t' and 'Empire n*****' at him.

That narrative, however, is now under serious scrutiny by investigators, who reportedly have evidence that Smollett directed his 'attackers' to buy the rope used in the 'assault' at a local hardware store.

Documents prove two Nigerian brothers, who work as extras on the highly rated Fox drama, bought the rope which was found around Smollett’s neck at Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in Chicago.

Sources said that the brothers used Smollett's money when they made the purchase on the weekend of January 25.

They also bought two red plain hats that they wore during the alleged attack, according to sources close to the investigation.

Police believe that the red hats were purchased at a local beauty supply store in the Uptown section of Chicago.

'We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,' Guglielmi said.

'We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.'

Chicago police are now ‘eager to speak to Jussie Smollett’ in light of the new information that was uncovered, according to ABC News.

‘We have been in touch with Smollett's attorneys,’ a Chicago Police Department spokesperson said. ‘We made our intentions clear.'

Smollett sat down with ABC's Robin Roberts to discuss the alleged attack on Friday

Scene: 'I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately ... but I was not hospitalized,' said Smollett (map with inset of the scene where the attack occurred just outside Smollett's apartment)

Chicago PD confirmed on Thursday that the pair seen in this image from surveillance footage around the time of the attack on January 29 (above) were Abel and Ola Osundairo

Ola and Abel were picked up at O'Hare Airport while disembarking a flight from Nigeria on Wednesday night.

The brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised another $500 upon returning, according to WBBM-TV.

Earlier on Saturday, Smollett hired Michael Cohen's high-powered criminal defense attorney, as the police investigation into the attack he reported last month took a sudden shift amid allegations of a hoax.

Attorney Michael Monico, a former federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Illinois, revealed in a radio interview on Thursday in Chicago that he is representing Smollett.

Monico, speaking on WGN's The Roe Conn Show, did not reveal how long he has been representing Smollet or in what capacity. Monico last month took over as co-counsel for Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer.

Michael Monico (above) revealed that he is Smollett's lawyer in a radio interview on Thursday

It came as police in Chicago suddenly released the two Nigerian extras on Smollett's show, who had previously been described as suspects in the attack, saying that 'new evidence' had emerged in their interrogations that requires further detective work.

'Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,' Guglielmi said in a statement on Friday night.

The Osundairo brothers' attorney, Gloria Schmidt, spoke briefly to reporters after their release, hinting that Smollett's legal future could hold difficulties.

'There's so many moving parts to this that will come out in time,' Schmidt said when asked if her clients had helped Smollett stage the attack. 'I'm going to let them tell their story when the time is right.'

Smollett has vigorously denied speculation that details of the attack were fabricated or staged, speaking out in an interview that aired on Wednesday just hours before the Osundairo brothers were detained.

It is unclear at this time what the Osundairo brothers told police that would alter the course of the investigation.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT COULD GET 3 YEARS IN PRISON FOR FILING A FALSE REPORT TO POLICE Mitchell Dutz, 18, was sentenced to three years in Illinois state prison for fabricating claims that three black men stole a car with a 13-month-old infant inside Filing a false report to police in the State of Illinois is considered an act of disorderly conduct, which is a Class 4 felony. That means that anyone found guilty could face between one and three years in prison. By law, the crime of disorderly conduct is committed in Illinois by anyone who 'transmits or causes to be transmitted in any manner to any peace officer, public officer or public employee a report to the effect that an offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed, knowing at the time of the transmission that there is no reasonable ground for believing that the offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed.' Last week, a central Illinois man was sentenced to three years in state prison after he pleaded guilty to fabricating an Amber alert. On December 15, Mitchell Dutz, 18, told police that three black men stole his car with a 13-month-old infant inside. Dutz used a social media photo of a child he did not know to claim that there was a kidnapping, according to Peoria Journal Star. But police rescinded the Amber alert after it became clear that it was a hoax. Dutz pleaded guilty to motor-vehicle burglary and disorderly conduct. Last month, a Chicago woman was charged with a felony after she allegedly made a 911 call that turned out to be a 'swatting' incident. Keesha S. Ingram, 41, allegedly called police before dawn on December 11 to report that a man was threatening to shoot his wife in their home in Warren Township. Sheriff's deputies responded to the call. They arrived at the scene and set up a perimeter around the house. Illinois police have issued an arrest warrant for Keesha S. Ingram, 41, who has been charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly calling police and fabricating claims that a man was threatening to shoot his wife After making contact with the residents inside, the deputies determined there was no incident to warrant an arrest, according to the Daily Herald. Authorities then determined that they were dealing with a 'swatting' incident whereby a person falsely reports an ongoing crime at a particular address in order to harass the individual who lives there. An investigation led back to Ingram, who is alleged to have known one of the people who lived in the Warren Township home. Investigators believe Ingram made the swatting call out of revenge against the victim, whom she accused of not paying her money that was owed to her. Ingram is still on the loose and is wanted for arrest, according to Patch.

Late on Friday, police sources said that cops had seized a bottle of bleach from Smollett's apartment, according to Fox News correspondent Matt Finn.

Meanwhile, new information surfaced about the Osundairo brothers, who in the course of 48 hours went from 'potential persons of interest' to 'potential suspects' to being under arrest because investigators had 'probable cause that they were involved in a crime' to being set free.

Since their release on Friday night, they have been staying at an undisclosed location.

Police said that the brothers were the two men who were seen on a surveillance image released to the public, and Smollett positively identified the two men in the image as his attackers in a televised interview.

The two brothers are both strongly opposed to President Donald Trump and fervently pro-LGBT, fellow Empire cast and crew members tell TMZ. Both men are said to be loyal fans of former President Barack Obama.

Smollett is said to be close with the brothers and would frequently approach them on set to discuss health and fitness.

Colleagues on the tight-knit Empire set said they had a hard time imagining that the Osundairo brothers could have been involved in the kind of homophobic and bigoted attack that Smollett described.

Abimbola, pictured, was booked on DUI and speeding charges in July 2015 according to Chicago arrest records. The brothers were picked up at Chicago O'Hare Airport on Wednesday

Police initially said that they tied the brothers to the reported attack using meticulous investigative efforts, including surveillance videos and information from ride-sharing companies.

Although Smollett said he did not know who attacked him, both brothers are known to the actor and he follows them on social media.

Their shared Instagram account also features a video of them working out at the private gym in Smollett's luxury apartment block.

The brothers left Chicago for Nigeria hours after the attack.

Celebrities rally behind Empire's Jussie Smollett after he is 'brutally attacked' in Chicago Celebrities and fans alike rallied to lend their support to Jussie Smollett after the 35-year-old actor claimed he was attacked last month. Janet Jackson took to her Twitter to share a special message for the actor, along with a photo of the two of them together. 'Sending so much luv and healing energy your way @jussiesmollett. we know that you’ll continue to change the world,' added Fergie. The sentiment was shared by Shonda Rhimes, who said: 'Sending love, healing, and support to @jussiesmollett. We ALL have a responsibility to rise up against the ignorance and hate out there. If you know who did this, REPORT THEM TO THE POLICE.' Naomi Campbell posted a impassioned plea to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to find the people responsible for the attack. Sending love to Jussie and the Smollett family after this horrific attack. We support you and pray that you find peace and justice,' said John Legend. 'This is heartbreaking and terrifying...please pay attention to what's happening here,' said Zendaya. 'Sending all my love to @JussieSmollett.' 'No words. Love to you @JussieSmollett,' added Margaret Cho. 'This is horrifying,' said Jamilah Lemieux. 'We love you @JussieSmollett. May justice be swift and unflinching.' '@JussieSmollett I love you,' said Tika Sumpter '@JussieSmollett praying you have a full and speedy recovery. So sorry this happened to you, added Raegan Gomez. Many condemned the racist and homophobic behavior and demanded justice. Ana Navarro said: 'I saw Jussie Smollett in Miami last week. I can't believe this happened. It is sad and disgusting and and deplorable.' The sentiment was shared by Reverend Al Sharpton, who added: 'The reported hate attack on my friend and brother, actor Jussie Smollett is despicable and outrageous. The guilty must face the maximum.' 'Sending so much love and prayers to you, @jussiesmollett. I’m in disbelief of what happened to you,' added Eva Longoria. 'It’s a senseless act that shall be met with justice! I can’t believe this is happening in 2019. This world has no room for hate. #AwaitingJustice' Others took the moment to throw criticism at 'gay jokes' and Kevin Hart's recent appearance on Ellen where he addressed the controversy surrounding his hosting the Oscars. Actor Ryan Jamaal Swain stated: 'This is why holding ""a little homophobic joke'""accountable is taken so FREAKING SERIOUSLY. To quote @amandaseales, you have to be overly confident...black gay men have to deal w/ not only racism but homophobia.' It is always abt duality and a form of respect. @JussieSmollett 'Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks,' said Saeed Jones. 'Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart.'

Their shared apartment was also raided by police, who took away bottles of bleach, electronics, a red hat and a pair of Nike shoes.

The FBI is also involved in the investigation after Smollett reported receiving hate mail.

Federal investigators have taken the lead on the mail case, and are supporting Chicago police in the investigation into Smollett's report of an assault.

Police have been cautious in their official public statements about the case. At last report, investigators still officially considered Smollett a victim in the case.

Smollett has continued to angrily denounce any speculation that the attack did not occur as he described, ascribing racist motives to skeptics and saying that no one would doubt him if he had reported being attacked by non-white assailants.

'I will never be the man that this did not happen to,' he told ABC on Wednesday. 'I am forever changed.'"

Rosie Ruiz pretended to win the Boston Marathon. Richard Blumenthal said he served in Vietnam. And Frank Abagnale of Catch Me If You Can fame pretended to be a pilot and a doctor. Those were the good old days, when Willie sang about how his heroes had always been cowboys. Today, everyone wants to play the victim. It's worth asking: Why?

The answer, of course, is a culture that rewards and honors them. If you can't be a victim in real life, you can play one on TV by pretending to be a member of a victimized class (see Rachel Dolezal and Elizabeth Warren).

The latest example involves actor Jussie Smollett, who Chicago police now believe paid two men to make it look like Trump supporters had assaulted him last month (Smollett vigorously denies this). In one interview, Smollett claimed that his alleged assailants said, “This is MAGA country,” before hitting him.

Smollet’s story appears ready to join Duke Lacrosse and the University of Virginia rape in a long line of hoaxes that many media outlets and political leaders were quick to fall for because it fit their preferred narrative. It's not enough that Donald Trump is a bad president, we are hell-bent on the idea that he has lit the match of hatred that incites and inspires violence. This theory explains why we were quick to believe the worst about those smirking white, MAGA hat-wearing Covington kids, and it's why we were quick to believe the Smollett story, too.

It is easy to understand the psychological reasons why 21st century poseurs cast themselves as the injured party. What’s more difficult to comprehend is why an already-struggling media industry is so ready to alienate half the country, and reinforce Donald Trump’s dangerous line about the “fake news” media in the process.

The 24/7 cable news and Twitter are part of the story, to be sure, but our haste is also a result of overt political pressure. Anyone who tries to employ prudence is assumed to be not sufficiently woke.

When Smollett said he had been the victim of a hate crime, progressive writers and politicians immediately began “working the refs,” taking to Twitter to shame law enforcement and journalists for using supposed weasel words like “alleged” or “racially charged.”

Take, for example, this GQ piece—one of hundreds I could point to—criticizing the police for referring to this as a “possible hate crime.” The author scoffs at this, saying, “The cautious wording is one last wound inflicted on Smollett's battered body.” But his scorn isn’t reserved solely for the police. He goes on to say that the media, “…goose-steps around the truth of the matter with shallow euphemisms like ‘racially charged’ used to describe open, proud bigotry.” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, likewise, chimed in on the “racially charged” line, declaring that “It is no one’s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes.”

Now, some of those pols are slowly walking things back. “I'm going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources,” Booker said Saturday.

His caution won’t last. In an era when victim status is the trump card for those wishing to advance a political agenda, you can count on more insistence that every victim must be believed immediately and alleged perpetrators presumed guilty. Outlets that fail to frame the news that way will feel the ongoing pressure campaign to get in line.

The unintended consequence has been to make the media look ridiculous as it keeps rushing to judgement and falling for hoax stories.

If we are to beat back the charges of “fake news” and defend the institution of journalism, we must defend those other old-fashioned ideas and institutions like the presumption of innocence, due process, and, yes, maybe even trying to avoid political bias.

It is telling that today’s highest-profile hoaxes—a measure that, of course, reflects what hoaxes are accepted at first and rewarded with media attention —are about appropriating someone else's victim status, not stealing their valor. Never mind the glory of heroes, experts, or champions, the desire for sympathy—and the moral authority that comes from being victimized—has replaced the desire for admiration or respect for some act of heroism.

I’m not sure what exactly that says about a society, but it can’t be good."

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the ""Empire"" star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it's all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!""— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump's election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett's own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had ""shifted"" — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again. Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police ""are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released.""

Smollett's attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D'Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

""And Libs wonder why we don't believe their BS stories,"" Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push ""the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.""

The response from Smollett's celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn't know what to say, but that the situation is a ""mess"" and a ""travesty.""

""I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,"" Gay wrote. ""The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.""

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a ""modern-day lynching."" On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment ""until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.""

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she ""can't blindly believe"" the Chicago Police Department.

""The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I'll wait,"" DuVernay said.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it's that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: ""Whatever the outcome, this won't stop me from believing others. It can't.""

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

""I'm not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,"" Gay wrote. ""Because more often than not they are telling the truth."""

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is prepared to issue the first veto of his term if Congress votes to disapprove his declaration of a national emergency along the U.S.-Mexico border, a top White House adviser said on Sunday.

White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told “Fox News Sunday” that “the president is going to protect his national emergency declaration.” Asked if that meant Trump was ready to veto a resolution of disapproval, Miller added, “He’s going to protect his national emergency declaration, guaranteed.”

The West Wing is digging in for fights on multiple fronts as the president’s effort to go around Congress to fund his long-promised border wall faces bipartisan criticism and multiple legal challenges. After lawmakers in both parties blocked his requests for billions of dollars to fulfil his signature campaign pledge, Trump’s declared national emergency Friday shifts billions of federal dollars earmarked for military construction to the border.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told ABC’s “This Week” that his state would sue “imminently” to block the order, after the American Civil Liberties Union and the non-profit watchdog group Public Citizen announced Friday they were taking legal action.

Democrats are planning to introduce a resolution disapproving of the declaration once Congress returns to session and it is likely to pass both chambers. Several Republican senators are already indicating they would vote against Trump — though there do not yet appear to be enough votes to override a veto by the president.

Chicago police seek follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Sunday they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor.

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

UK lawmakers slam Facebook, recommend stiffer regulation

NEW YORK (AP) — British lawmakers issued a scathing report Monday that accused Facebook of intentionally violating privacy and anti-competition laws in the U.K., and called for greater oversight of social media companies.

The report on fake news and disinformation on social media sites followed an 18-month investigation. The parliamentary committee that prepared the report says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator to better control harmful or illegal content.

The report called out Facebook in particular, saying that the site’s structure seems to be designed to “conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific decisions.”

“It is evident that Facebook intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws,” the report states. It also accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing contempt for the U.K. Parliament by declining numerous invitations to appear before the committee.

Facebook did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.

Ex-FBI official: ‘Crime may have been committed’ by Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said in an interview that aired Sunday that a “crime may have been committed” when President Donald Trump fired the head of the FBI and tried to publicly undermine an investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia.

McCabe also said in the interview with “60 Minutes” that the FBI had good reason to open a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was in league with Russia, and therefore a possible national security threat, following the May 2017 firing of then-FBI Director James Comey.

“And the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the of the FBI to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia’s malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, “Why would a president of the United States do that?” McCabe said.

He added: “So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?”

Asked whether Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was onboard with the obstruction and counterintelligence investigations, McCabe replied, “Absolutely.”

Abe mum on reports he nominated Trump for Nobel Peace Prize

TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his chief spokesman have declined to say if Abe nominated President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Abe noted while speaking in Parliament on Monday that the Nobel committee does not disclose the parties behind nominations for a half-century. He said, “I thus decline comment.”

The government’s top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters that Japan highly valued Trump’s efforts on North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, but he echoed Abe in refusing other comment.

Trump said Friday that Abe had nominated him, sending him a “beautiful copy” of a letter sent to the committee. That claim could not be immediately verified.

The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported on Sunday, citing unnamed government sources, that Abe nominated Trump’s at the president’s request.

China’s leaders want more babies, but local officials resist

BEIJING (AP) — Facing a future demographic crisis and aging society, China’s leaders are desperately seeking to persuade couples to have more children.

But bureaucrats don’t seem to have gotten the message, fining a couple in a recent widely publicized case for having a third child against the strict letter of the law.

The move has sparked public outrage as people vent their anger at population control officials who are hungry for revenue and have long persecuted couples for violating the now-scrapped “one-child policy.”

“The country is doing all it can to encourage childbirth but the local governments need money, so we end with this sort of madness,” a columnist and political commentator who writes under the name Lianpeng said on China’s Weibo microblogging service.

“The low birthrate has everyone on edge, yet the local governments care only about collecting fees,” journalist Jin Wei wrote on her verified Weibo account. “I don’t know of any other nation that pulls its people in different directions like this.”

Aurora shooter’s permit was revoked but gun wasn’t seized

AURORA, Ill. (AP) — An initial background check failed to detect a felony conviction that should have barred the man who killed five co-workers and wounded six other people at a suburban Chicago manufacturing plant from buying the gun.

Months later, a second background check of Gary Martin found his 1995 aggravated assault conviction in Mississippi involving the stabbing of an ex-girlfriend. But it prompted only a letter stating his gun permit had been revoked and ordering him to turn over his firearm to police — raising questions about the state’s enforcement to ensure those who lose their permits also turn over their weapons.

A vigil for the victims , including a university student on his first day as an intern and a longtime plant manager, was held Sunday outside Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, about 40 miles (65 kilometres) west of Chicago. More than 1,500 people braved snow and freezing drizzle to attend.

Martin, 45, was killed in a shootout with officers Friday, ending his deadly rampage at the plant. His state gun license permit was revoked in 2014, Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said.

But he never gave up the .40-calibre Smith & Wesson handgun he used in the attack. Investigators are still trying to determine what exactly law enforcement agencies did after that letter was sent, Ziman said.

School board in Virginia may end transgender bathroom ban

NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — For nearly four years, Gavin Grimm has been suing his former school district after it banned him from using the boys bathrooms in high school.

Along the way, he’s became a national face for transgender rights. His case almost went to the U.S. Supreme Court. He graduated and moved to California but kept fighting.

The school board in Virginia may finally be giving in, although not in court. It will hold a public hearing Tuesday to discuss the possibility of allowing transgender students to use restrooms that correspond with their gender identity.

“I have fought this legal battle for the past four years because I want to make sure that other transgender students do not have to go through the same pain and humiliation that I did,” he said.

The Gloucester County School Board’s meeting comes just months before a trial is set to begin over its current bathroom rules.

Team LeBron rallies to beat Team Giannis, 178-164

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — LeBron James was trading lob passes with Dwyane Wade again, one last time. Catching lobs from Kyrie Irving once again, too. And after making a stepback 3-pointer late, he stared down Joel Embiid to send a message without saying a word.

Oh, this mattered to James — and Team LeBron as well.

Team LeBron, down by 20 in the second half, finally got firing and went on to beat Team Giannis 178-164 in the All-Star Game on Sunday night. MVP Kevin Durant scored 31 points for Team LeBron, the one that James drafted and led to victory in the captain’s-choice format for a second consecutive season.

“You put me on the floor, I love to compete,” James said in the postgame interview room. “I’m a competitor, no matter what it is. I was competing to see if I could get to this table first.”

He wasn’t kidding. He then turned to NBA spokesman Mark Broussard, asked if he was the first player to get into the room and grinned when told he was.

Denny Hamlin cruises to 2nd Daytona 500 victory in 4 years

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Denny Hamlin came to the Daytona 500 determined to honour his late car owner with a victory.

He delivered with a storybook tribute for Joe Gibbs Racing.

Hamlin won NASCAR’s biggest race for the second time in four years Sunday, leading JGR in a 1-2-3 sweep of the podium in overtime. The race and the season have been dedicated to J.D. Gibbs, Joe Gibbs’ eldest son who died last month after battling a degenerative neurological disease.

J.D. Gibbs helped his father start the race team, ran it while Joe Gibbs was coaching the Washington Redskins, was a tire changer on the team’s first Daytona 500 victory and the one who discovered Hamlin during a test session at Hickory Motor Speedway in North Carolina. Hamlin was hired to drive the No. 11 — the number J.D. Gibbs used when he played football — and J.D. Gibbs’ name is on the Toyota.

When Hamlin stopped his car along the frontstretch to collect the checkered flag, he immediately credited J.D. Gibbs.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had ‘shifted” — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again. Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police “are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

“And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,” Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push “the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.”

The response from Smollett’s celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn’t know what to say, but that the situation is a “mess” and a “travesty.”

“I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

“I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,” Gay wrote. “Because more often than not they are telling the truth.”

Trump pleads with Venezuela's military to back Guaido

MIAMI (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday pleaded with Venezuela's military to support opposition leader Juan Guaido and issued a dire warning if they continue to stand with President Nicolas Maduro's government.

""You will find no safe harbour, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything,"" Trump said in a speech at Florida International University in Miami before large American and Venezuelan flags.

Trump added: ""We seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open.""

The Venezuelan military could play a decisive role in the stalemate but has largely remained loyal to Maduro.

In remarks broadcast on state television, Maduro accused the U.S. president of speaking in an ""almost Nazi style"" and lashed out at Trump for thinking he can deliver orders to Venezuela's military.

Tense standoff spells endgame for IS militants in Syria

BAGHOUZ, Syria (AP) — The collection of tents was largely silent on a sunny winter Monday afternoon. Few people were visible, but the few out and about were calm: Two men in long robes and pants walked slowly together through the grass, a woman leisurely came out of her tent to look around, a man on a motorcycle drove toward the river.

This is the last speck of land held by the Islamic State group — a patch along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria where an estimated 300 militants are mixed in with hundreds of civilians, refusing to surrender and trying to negotiate an exit with the U.S.-backed forces surrounding them.

An Associated Press team got a rare glimpse of the IS-held settlement, standing on a rooftop about a kilometre (half mile) away during a media tour to the front lines organized by the Syrian Democratic Forces. The roof looked out over a flat, green landscape with scattered palm trees, to an earthen berm and a line of pickup trucks put up by the militants at the edge of the camp.

At one point, gunfire crackled in the distance. An SDF commander on the roof with a number of fighters said it isn't always so quiet. Only days earlier the militants surprised the soldiers with an attempted night raid. The SDF can't assault the site or call in airstrikes because of the civilians, he said, adding that his fighters have seen the militants moving civilians around at gunpoint as protection.

""They try a psychological war. But that is it! The war is over, and we won,"" said the commander, who spoke on condition he be identified only by his nom de guerre, Baran, in line with SDF rules.

W.Va. teachers' unions call for strike over education bill

CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — West Virginia teachers' unions on Monday called a statewide strike over an education bill that they view as lacking their input and as retaliation for a walkout last year.

The strike is scheduled to start Tuesday, leaders of three unions for teachers and school service workers said at a news conference, almost a year to the day after teachers started a nine-day walkout.

""We are left with no other choice,"" said Fred Albert, president of the American Federation of Teachers' West Virginia chapter.

The 2018 walkout launched the national ""Red4Ed"" movement that included strikes in Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arizona, Washington state, and more recently, Los Angeles and Denver. Teachers in Oakland, California, have authorized a strike starting Thursday.

Now the movement has come full circle.

Trump the pundit handicaps 2020 Democratic contenders

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Kamala Harris had the best campaign roll-out. Amy Klobuchar's snowy debut showed grit. Elizabeth Warren's opening campaign video was a bit odd. Take it from an unlikely armchair pundit sizing up the 2020 Democratic field: President Donald Trump.

In tweets, public remarks and private conversations, Trump is making clear he is closely following the campaign to challenge him on the ballot. Facing no serious primary opponent of his own — at least so far — Trump is establishing himself as an in-their-face observer of the Democratic Party's nominating process — and no will be surprised to find that he's not being coy about weighing in.

Presidents traditionally ignore their potential opponents as long as possible to maintain their status as an incumbent floating above the contenders who are auditioning for a job they already inhabit.

Not Trump. He's eager to shape the debate, sow discord and help position himself for the general election. It's just one more norm to shatter, and a risky bet that his acerbic politics will work to his advantage once again.

This is the president whose 240-character blasts and penchant for insults made mincemeat of his 2016 Republican rivals. And Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, said the president aims to use Twitter again this time to ""define his potential opponent and impact the Democrat primary debate.""

3 children among 4 found dead after west Michigan shooting

SOLON TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — Authorities say three children and a woman were found dead of apparent gunshot wounds at a home in western Michigan.

Kent County Sheriff Michelle LaJoye-Young says authorities responded Monday to a property near Cedar Springs, a community about 30 miles (48 kilometres) north of Grand Rapids. She says someone discovered the bodies and called 911.

LaJoye-Young said the three children were elementary school-aged and younger but declined to provide further information about the victims' relationships to one another. She said authorities were still confirming the victims' identities.

LaJoye-Young called the scene ""a horrific thing to be called to"" and said ""my heart goes out to the families involved here and the community.""

Authorities don't believe there is a shooter at large. An investigation is ongoing.

N Carolina elections head says ballots handled illegally

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A Republican operative conducted an illegal and well-funded ballot-harvesting operation, North Carolina's elections director said Monday, but the first session of a days-long hearing produced scant evidence that the GOP congressional candidate he worked for knew about it or even benefited.

The director's testimony came at the opening of a state elections board hearing into whether mail-in ballots were tampered with in the race for the state's 9th congressional district seat that saw Republican Mark Harris narrowly defeat Democrat Dan McCready.

The race wasn't certified, leaving the country's only congressional election without a declared winner. The elections board is expected to either declare a winner or order a new election after the hearing.

""The evidence that we will provide today will show that a co-ordinated, unlawful and substantially resourced absentee ballot scheme operated in the 2018 general election"" in rural Bladen and Robeson counties, which are part of the congressional district, state elections director Kim Strach said.

Harris held a slim lead over McCready in unofficial results following November's election, but the state elections board refused to certify the contest after allegations of potential ballot manipulation surfaced. There wasn't evidence presented Monday that the election irregularities were so widespread that it would overturn Harris' 905 vote lead. The hearing will continue Tuesday and could continue beyond then.

Brazil's #metoo moment: Spiritual guru accused of sex abuse

ABADIANIA, Brazil (AP) — For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer.

His work was both praised — Oprah Winfrey called de Faria ""inspiring"" while visiting in 2012 — and heavily scrutinized. Now, de Faria, who goes by the name ""Joao de Deus,"" or ""John of God,"" is in trouble with the law.

Since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape. The mounting accusations are turning the 77-year-old spiritual guru into Brazil's first major figure to go down in the #metoo era, which has been slow to take off in Latin America's largest nation despite myriad problems with gender equality.

Meanwhile, the people in Abadiania, about a two-hour drive west from the nation's capital of Brasilia, are in disbelief. They also fear for their futures without de Faria.

""All of Abadiania depended on the work of Joao,"" said Claudio Pruja, the owner of a small inn who also sometimes worked as an assistant to de Faria. ""We don't have a beach. This isn't Copacabana.""

First private Israel lunar mission to be launched this week

RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) — A non-profit Israeli consortium said Monday that it hopes to make history this week by launching the first private aircraft to land on the moon.

SpaceIL and state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries told a news conference that the landing craft — dubbed ""Beresheet,"" or Genesis — will take off from Florida, propelled by a SpaceX Falcon rocket on its weekslong voyage to the moon.

The launch is scheduled late Thursday in the United States, early Friday in Israel. It had been originally slated for last December.

SpaceIL CEO Ido Anteby and Opher Doron, general manager of the IAI's space division, said the spacecraft will slingshot around the Earth at least six times in order to reach the moon and land on its surface on April 11.

If the SpaceIL mission is successful, Israel will become the fourth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, after the Soviet Union, United States and China.

Sailor in iconic V-J Day Times Square kiss photo dies at 95

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The ecstatic sailor shown kissing a woman in Times Square celebrating the end of World War II died Sunday. George Mendonsa was 95.

Mendonsa fell and had a seizure at the assisted living facility in Middletown, Rhode Island, where he lived with his wife of 70 years, his daughter, Sharon Molleur, told The Providence Journal.

Mendonsa was shown kissing Greta Zimmer Friedman, a dental assistant in a nurse's uniform, on Aug. 14, 1945 — known as V-J Day, the day Japan surrendered to the United States. People spilled into the New York City streets to celebrate the news.

Mendonsa planted a kiss on Friedman, whom he had never met.

An iconic photo of the kiss by Alfred Eisenstaedt was first published in Life magazine and is called ""V-J Day in Times Square,"" but is known to most as ""The Kiss.""

Column: Daytona 500 was action-packed opener NASCAR needed

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Jim France told 'em to race and NASCAR's next generation didn't disappoint.

The Daytona 500 packed an unforeseen punch that, if nothing else, entertained Sunday's sun-drenched, sold-out crowd at the famed ""World Center of Racing."" There were a ton of wrecks, especially during the final 20 laps of regulation, which Kyle Busch described as the portion of the race in which ""brains come unglued.""

The crashes led to nearly 40 minutes of stoppage for cleanup — breaks so long race-winner Denny Hamlin claimed he twice fell asleep in his Toyota. Hamlin led a clean sweep for Joe Gibbs Racing, which went 1-2-3 in an overtime finish that honoured team co-founder J.D. Gibbs following his death last month from a long battle with a degenerative neurological disease.

It was an emotional weekend at Daytona International Speedway for Joe Gibbs, who leaned on his eldest son to run their NASCAR operation while he coached the Washington Redskins. J.D. Gibbs was a driver, a tire changer, team executive, talent scout and the guy who discovered a struggling Virginia short track racer who is now a two-time Daytona 500 winner.

Gibbs has three Super Bowl victories and three wins in NASCAR's version of the Super Bowl, and he ranked Hamlin's win ""the most emotional and biggest win I've ever had in my life, in anything."""

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is prepared to issue the first veto of his term if Congress votes to disapprove his declaration of a national emergency along the U.S.-Mexico border, a top White House adviser said on Sunday.

White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told “Fox News Sunday” that “the president is going to protect his national emergency declaration.” Asked if that meant Trump was ready to veto a resolution of disapproval, Miller added, “He’s going to protect his national emergency declaration, guaranteed.”

The West Wing is digging in for fights on multiple fronts as the president’s effort to go around Congress to fund his long-promised border wall faces bipartisan criticism and multiple legal challenges. After lawmakers in both parties blocked his requests for billions of dollars to fulfil his signature campaign pledge, Trump’s declared national emergency Friday shifts billions of federal dollars earmarked for military construction to the border.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told ABC’s “This Week” that his state would sue “imminently” to block the order, after the American Civil Liberties Union and the non-profit watchdog group Public Citizen announced Friday they were taking legal action.

Democrats are planning to introduce a resolution disapproving of the declaration once Congress returns to session and it is likely to pass both chambers. Several Republican senators are already indicating they would vote against Trump — though there do not yet appear to be enough votes to override a veto by the president.

Chicago police seek follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Sunday they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor.

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

UK lawmakers slam Facebook, recommend stiffer regulation

NEW YORK (AP) — British lawmakers issued a scathing report Monday that accused Facebook of intentionally violating privacy and anti-competition laws in the U.K., and called for greater oversight of social media companies.

The report on fake news and disinformation on social media sites followed an 18-month investigation. The parliamentary committee that prepared the report says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator to better control harmful or illegal content.

The report called out Facebook in particular, saying that the site’s structure seems to be designed to “conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific decisions.”

“It is evident that Facebook intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws,” the report states. It also accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing contempt for the U.K. Parliament by declining numerous invitations to appear before the committee.

Facebook did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.

Ex-FBI official: ‘Crime may have been committed’ by Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said in an interview that aired Sunday that a “crime may have been committed” when President Donald Trump fired the head of the FBI and tried to publicly undermine an investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia.

McCabe also said in the interview with “60 Minutes” that the FBI had good reason to open a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was in league with Russia, and therefore a possible national security threat, following the May 2017 firing of then-FBI Director James Comey.

“And the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the of the FBI to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia’s malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, “Why would a president of the United States do that?” McCabe said.

He added: “So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?”

Asked whether Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was onboard with the obstruction and counterintelligence investigations, McCabe replied, “Absolutely.”

Abe mum on reports he nominated Trump for Nobel Peace Prize

TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his chief spokesman have declined to say if Abe nominated President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Abe noted while speaking in Parliament on Monday that the Nobel committee does not disclose the parties behind nominations for a half-century. He said, “I thus decline comment.”

The government’s top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters that Japan highly valued Trump’s efforts on North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, but he echoed Abe in refusing other comment.

Trump said Friday that Abe had nominated him, sending him a “beautiful copy” of a letter sent to the committee. That claim could not be immediately verified.

The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported on Sunday, citing unnamed government sources, that Abe nominated Trump’s at the president’s request.

China’s leaders want more babies, but local officials resist

BEIJING (AP) — Facing a future demographic crisis and aging society, China’s leaders are desperately seeking to persuade couples to have more children.

But bureaucrats don’t seem to have gotten the message, fining a couple in a recent widely publicized case for having a third child against the strict letter of the law.

The move has sparked public outrage as people vent their anger at population control officials who are hungry for revenue and have long persecuted couples for violating the now-scrapped “one-child policy.”

“The country is doing all it can to encourage childbirth but the local governments need money, so we end with this sort of madness,” a columnist and political commentator who writes under the name Lianpeng said on China’s Weibo microblogging service.

“The low birthrate has everyone on edge, yet the local governments care only about collecting fees,” journalist Jin Wei wrote on her verified Weibo account. “I don’t know of any other nation that pulls its people in different directions like this.”

Aurora shooter’s permit was revoked but gun wasn’t seized

AURORA, Ill. (AP) — An initial background check failed to detect a felony conviction that should have barred the man who killed five co-workers and wounded six other people at a suburban Chicago manufacturing plant from buying the gun.

Months later, a second background check of Gary Martin found his 1995 aggravated assault conviction in Mississippi involving the stabbing of an ex-girlfriend. But it prompted only a letter stating his gun permit had been revoked and ordering him to turn over his firearm to police — raising questions about the state’s enforcement to ensure those who lose their permits also turn over their weapons.

A vigil for the victims , including a university student on his first day as an intern and a longtime plant manager, was held Sunday outside Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, about 40 miles (65 kilometres) west of Chicago. More than 1,500 people braved snow and freezing drizzle to attend.

Martin, 45, was killed in a shootout with officers Friday, ending his deadly rampage at the plant. His state gun license permit was revoked in 2014, Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said.

But he never gave up the .40-calibre Smith & Wesson handgun he used in the attack. Investigators are still trying to determine what exactly law enforcement agencies did after that letter was sent, Ziman said.

School board in Virginia may end transgender bathroom ban

NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — For nearly four years, Gavin Grimm has been suing his former school district after it banned him from using the boys bathrooms in high school.

Along the way, he’s became a national face for transgender rights. His case almost went to the U.S. Supreme Court. He graduated and moved to California but kept fighting.

The school board in Virginia may finally be giving in, although not in court. It will hold a public hearing Tuesday to discuss the possibility of allowing transgender students to use restrooms that correspond with their gender identity.

“I have fought this legal battle for the past four years because I want to make sure that other transgender students do not have to go through the same pain and humiliation that I did,” he said.

The Gloucester County School Board’s meeting comes just months before a trial is set to begin over its current bathroom rules.

Team LeBron rallies to beat Team Giannis, 178-164

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — LeBron James was trading lob passes with Dwyane Wade again, one last time. Catching lobs from Kyrie Irving once again, too. And after making a stepback 3-pointer late, he stared down Joel Embiid to send a message without saying a word.

Oh, this mattered to James — and Team LeBron as well.

Team LeBron, down by 20 in the second half, finally got firing and went on to beat Team Giannis 178-164 in the All-Star Game on Sunday night. MVP Kevin Durant scored 31 points for Team LeBron, the one that James drafted and led to victory in the captain’s-choice format for a second consecutive season.

“You put me on the floor, I love to compete,” James said in the postgame interview room. “I’m a competitor, no matter what it is. I was competing to see if I could get to this table first.”

He wasn’t kidding. He then turned to NBA spokesman Mark Broussard, asked if he was the first player to get into the room and grinned when told he was.

Denny Hamlin cruises to 2nd Daytona 500 victory in 4 years

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Denny Hamlin came to the Daytona 500 determined to honour his late car owner with a victory.

He delivered with a storybook tribute for Joe Gibbs Racing.

Hamlin won NASCAR’s biggest race for the second time in four years Sunday, leading JGR in a 1-2-3 sweep of the podium in overtime. The race and the season have been dedicated to J.D. Gibbs, Joe Gibbs’ eldest son who died last month after battling a degenerative neurological disease.

J.D. Gibbs helped his father start the race team, ran it while Joe Gibbs was coaching the Washington Redskins, was a tire changer on the team’s first Daytona 500 victory and the one who discovered Hamlin during a test session at Hickory Motor Speedway in North Carolina. Hamlin was hired to drive the No. 11 — the number J.D. Gibbs used when he played football — and J.D. Gibbs’ name is on the Toyota.

When Hamlin stopped his car along the frontstretch to collect the checkered flag, he immediately credited J.D. Gibbs.

Trump pleads with Venezuela's military to back Guaido

MIAMI (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday pleaded with Venezuela's military to support opposition leader Juan Guaido and issued a dire warning if they continue to stand with President Nicolas Maduro's government.

""You will find no safe harbour, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything,"" Trump said in a speech at Florida International University in Miami before large American and Venezuelan flags.

Trump added: ""We seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open.""

The Venezuelan military could play a decisive role in the stalemate but has largely remained loyal to Maduro.

In remarks broadcast on state television, Maduro accused the U.S. president of speaking in an ""almost Nazi style"" and lashed out at Trump for thinking he can deliver orders to Venezuela's military.

Tense standoff spells endgame for IS militants in Syria

BAGHOUZ, Syria (AP) — The collection of tents was largely silent on a sunny winter Monday afternoon. Few people were visible, but the few out and about were calm: Two men in long robes and pants walked slowly together through the grass, a woman leisurely came out of her tent to look around, a man on a motorcycle drove toward the river.

This is the last speck of land held by the Islamic State group — a patch along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria where an estimated 300 militants are mixed in with hundreds of civilians, refusing to surrender and trying to negotiate an exit with the U.S.-backed forces surrounding them.

An Associated Press team got a rare glimpse of the IS-held settlement, standing on a rooftop about a kilometre (half mile) away during a media tour to the front lines organized by the Syrian Democratic Forces. The roof looked out over a flat, green landscape with scattered palm trees, to an earthen berm and a line of pickup trucks put up by the militants at the edge of the camp.

At one point, gunfire crackled in the distance. An SDF commander on the roof with a number of fighters said it isn't always so quiet. Only days earlier the militants surprised the soldiers with an attempted night raid. The SDF can't assault the site or call in airstrikes because of the civilians, he said, adding that his fighters have seen the militants moving civilians around at gunpoint as protection.

""They try a psychological war. But that is it! The war is over, and we won,"" said the commander, who spoke on condition he be identified only by his nom de guerre, Baran, in line with SDF rules.

W.Va. teachers' unions call for strike over education bill

CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — West Virginia teachers' unions on Monday called a statewide strike over an education bill that they view as lacking their input and as retaliation for a walkout last year.

The strike is scheduled to start Tuesday, leaders of three unions for teachers and school service workers said at a news conference, almost a year to the day after teachers started a nine-day walkout.

""We are left with no other choice,"" said Fred Albert, president of the American Federation of Teachers' West Virginia chapter.

The 2018 walkout launched the national ""Red4Ed"" movement that included strikes in Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arizona, Washington state, and more recently, Los Angeles and Denver. Teachers in Oakland, California, have authorized a strike starting Thursday.

Now the movement has come full circle.

Trump the pundit handicaps 2020 Democratic contenders

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Kamala Harris had the best campaign roll-out. Amy Klobuchar's snowy debut showed grit. Elizabeth Warren's opening campaign video was a bit odd. Take it from an unlikely armchair pundit sizing up the 2020 Democratic field: President Donald Trump.

In tweets, public remarks and private conversations, Trump is making clear he is closely following the campaign to challenge him on the ballot. Facing no serious primary opponent of his own — at least so far — Trump is establishing himself as an in-their-face observer of the Democratic Party's nominating process — and no will be surprised to find that he's not being coy about weighing in.

Presidents traditionally ignore their potential opponents as long as possible to maintain their status as an incumbent floating above the contenders who are auditioning for a job they already inhabit.

Not Trump. He's eager to shape the debate, sow discord and help position himself for the general election. It's just one more norm to shatter, and a risky bet that his acerbic politics will work to his advantage once again.

This is the president whose 240-character blasts and penchant for insults made mincemeat of his 2016 Republican rivals. And Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, said the president aims to use Twitter again this time to ""define his potential opponent and impact the Democrat primary debate.""

3 children among 4 found dead after west Michigan shooting

SOLON TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — Authorities say three children and a woman were found dead of apparent gunshot wounds at a home in western Michigan.

Kent County Sheriff Michelle LaJoye-Young says authorities responded Monday to a property near Cedar Springs, a community about 30 miles (48 kilometres) north of Grand Rapids. She says someone discovered the bodies and called 911.

LaJoye-Young said the three children were elementary school-aged and younger but declined to provide further information about the victims' relationships to one another. She said authorities were still confirming the victims' identities.

LaJoye-Young called the scene ""a horrific thing to be called to"" and said ""my heart goes out to the families involved here and the community.""

Authorities don't believe there is a shooter at large. An investigation is ongoing.

N Carolina elections head says ballots handled illegally

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A Republican operative conducted an illegal and well-funded ballot-harvesting operation, North Carolina's elections director said Monday, but the first session of a days-long hearing produced scant evidence that the GOP congressional candidate he worked for knew about it or even benefited.

The director's testimony came at the opening of a state elections board hearing into whether mail-in ballots were tampered with in the race for the state's 9th congressional district seat that saw Republican Mark Harris narrowly defeat Democrat Dan McCready.

The race wasn't certified, leaving the country's only congressional election without a declared winner. The elections board is expected to either declare a winner or order a new election after the hearing.

""The evidence that we will provide today will show that a co-ordinated, unlawful and substantially resourced absentee ballot scheme operated in the 2018 general election"" in rural Bladen and Robeson counties, which are part of the congressional district, state elections director Kim Strach said.

Harris held a slim lead over McCready in unofficial results following November's election, but the state elections board refused to certify the contest after allegations of potential ballot manipulation surfaced. There wasn't evidence presented Monday that the election irregularities were so widespread that it would overturn Harris' 905 vote lead. The hearing will continue Tuesday and could continue beyond then.

Brazil's #metoo moment: Spiritual guru accused of sex abuse

ABADIANIA, Brazil (AP) — For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer.

His work was both praised — Oprah Winfrey called de Faria ""inspiring"" while visiting in 2012 — and heavily scrutinized. Now, de Faria, who goes by the name ""Joao de Deus,"" or ""John of God,"" is in trouble with the law.

Since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape. The mounting accusations are turning the 77-year-old spiritual guru into Brazil's first major figure to go down in the #metoo era, which has been slow to take off in Latin America's largest nation despite myriad problems with gender equality.

Meanwhile, the people in Abadiania, about a two-hour drive west from the nation's capital of Brasilia, are in disbelief. They also fear for their futures without de Faria.

""All of Abadiania depended on the work of Joao,"" said Claudio Pruja, the owner of a small inn who also sometimes worked as an assistant to de Faria. ""We don't have a beach. This isn't Copacabana.""

First private Israel lunar mission to be launched this week

RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) — A non-profit Israeli consortium said Monday that it hopes to make history this week by launching the first private aircraft to land on the moon.

SpaceIL and state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries told a news conference that the landing craft — dubbed ""Beresheet,"" or Genesis — will take off from Florida, propelled by a SpaceX Falcon rocket on its weekslong voyage to the moon.

The launch is scheduled late Thursday in the United States, early Friday in Israel. It had been originally slated for last December.

SpaceIL CEO Ido Anteby and Opher Doron, general manager of the IAI's space division, said the spacecraft will slingshot around the Earth at least six times in order to reach the moon and land on its surface on April 11.

If the SpaceIL mission is successful, Israel will become the fourth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, after the Soviet Union, United States and China.

Sailor in iconic V-J Day Times Square kiss photo dies at 95

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The ecstatic sailor shown kissing a woman in Times Square celebrating the end of World War II died Sunday. George Mendonsa was 95.

Mendonsa fell and had a seizure at the assisted living facility in Middletown, Rhode Island, where he lived with his wife of 70 years, his daughter, Sharon Molleur, told The Providence Journal.

Mendonsa was shown kissing Greta Zimmer Friedman, a dental assistant in a nurse's uniform, on Aug. 14, 1945 — known as V-J Day, the day Japan surrendered to the United States. People spilled into the New York City streets to celebrate the news.

Mendonsa planted a kiss on Friedman, whom he had never met.

An iconic photo of the kiss by Alfred Eisenstaedt was first published in Life magazine and is called ""V-J Day in Times Square,"" but is known to most as ""The Kiss.""

Column: Daytona 500 was action-packed opener NASCAR needed

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Jim France told 'em to race and NASCAR's next generation didn't disappoint.

The Daytona 500 packed an unforeseen punch that, if nothing else, entertained Sunday's sun-drenched, sold-out crowd at the famed ""World Center of Racing."" There were a ton of wrecks, especially during the final 20 laps of regulation, which Kyle Busch described as the portion of the race in which ""brains come unglued.""

The crashes led to nearly 40 minutes of stoppage for cleanup — breaks so long race-winner Denny Hamlin claimed he twice fell asleep in his Toyota. Hamlin led a clean sweep for Joe Gibbs Racing, which went 1-2-3 in an overtime finish that honoured team co-founder J.D. Gibbs following his death last month from a long battle with a degenerative neurological disease.

It was an emotional weekend at Daytona International Speedway for Joe Gibbs, who leaned on his eldest son to run their NASCAR operation while he coached the Washington Redskins. J.D. Gibbs was a driver, a tire changer, team executive, talent scout and the guy who discovered a struggling Virginia short track racer who is now a two-time Daytona 500 winner.

Gibbs has three Super Bowl victories and three wins in NASCAR's version of the Super Bowl, and he ranked Hamlin's win ""the most emotional and biggest win I've ever had in my life, in anything."""

16 states sue Trump over emergency wall declaration

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California and 15 other states filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump’s emergency declaration to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra released a statement Monday saying the suit alleges the Trump administration’s action violates the Constitution.

“President Trump treats the rule of law with utter contempt,” Becerra said. “He knows there is no border crisis, he knows his emergency declaration is unwarranted, and he admits that he will likely lose this case in court.”

Joining California in filing the lawsuit are the attorneys general of Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Virginia. All the states involved in the lawsuit have Democratic attorneys general.

Trump declared a national emergency to fulfill his promise of completing the wall.

Trump pleads with Venezuela’s military to back Guaido

MIAMI (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday pleaded with Venezuela’s military to support opposition leader Juan Guaido and issued a dire warning if they continue to stand with President Nicolas Maduro’s government.

“You will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything,” Trump said in a speech at Florida International University in Miami before large American and Venezuelan flags.

Trump added: “We seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open.”

The Venezuelan military could play a decisive role in the stalemate but has largely remained loyal to Maduro.

In remarks broadcast on state television, Maduro accused the U.S. president of speaking in an “almost Nazi style” and lashed out at Trump for thinking he can deliver orders to Venezuela’s military.

Official: Deputy AG Rosenstein expected to depart in March

WASHINGTON (AP) — A Justice Department official says Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is expected to leave his position in the middle of next month.

The official was not authorized to discuss the move by name and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Monday night.

The White House is expected to name a replacement for Rosenstein this week.

Rosenstein’s departure had been expected with the confirmation of William Barr as attorney general last week.

Rosenstein has been on the job for nearly two years.

Tense standoff spells endgame for IS militants in Syria

BAGHOUZ, Syria (AP) — The collection of tents was largely silent on a sunny winter Monday afternoon. Few people were visible, but the few out and about were calm: Two men in long robes and pants walked slowly together through the grass, a woman leisurely came out of her tent to look around, a man on a motorcycle drove toward the river.

This is the last speck of land held by the Islamic State group — a patch along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria where an estimated 300 militants are mixed in with hundreds of civilians, refusing to surrender and trying to negotiate an exit with the U.S.-backed forces surrounding them.

An Associated Press team got a rare glimpse of the IS-held settlement, standing on a rooftop about a kilometer (half mile) away during a media tour to the front lines organized by the Syrian Democratic Forces. The roof looked out over a flat, green landscape with scattered palm trees, to an earthen berm and a line of pickup trucks put up by the militants at the edge of the camp.

At one point, gunfire crackled in the distance. An SDF commander on the roof with a number of fighters said it isn’t always so quiet. Only days earlier the militants surprised the soldiers with an attempted night raid. The SDF can’t assault the site or call in airstrikes because of the civilians, he said, adding that his fighters have seen the militants moving civilians around at gunpoint as protection.

“They try a psychological war. But that is it! The war is over, and we won,” said the commander, who spoke on condition he be identified only by his nom de guerre, Baran, in line with SDF rules.

W.Va. teachers’ unions call for strike over education bill

CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — West Virginia teachers’ unions on Monday called a statewide strike over an education bill that they view as lacking their input and as retaliation for a walkout last year.

The strike is scheduled to start Tuesday, leaders of three unions for teachers and school service workers said at a news conference, almost a year to the day after teachers started a nine-day walkout.

“We are left with no other choice,” said Fred Albert, president of the American Federation of Teachers’ West Virginia chapter.

The 2018 walkout launched the national “Red4Ed” movement that included strikes in Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arizona, Washington state, and more recently, Los Angeles and Denver. Teachers in Oakland, California, have authorized a strike starting Thursday.

Now the movement has come full circle.

Lisa Borders steps down as head of Time’s Up organization

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Lisa Borders says she has resigned as president and CEO of Time’s Up, the gender equality initiative formed last year in response to sexual misconduct allegations in Hollywood.

Borders says in statement Monday that she is stepping aside “with deep regret” due to family issues. She didn’t elaborate.

Chief Operating Officer Rebecca Goldman will serve as interim CEO while the organization conducts an executive search.

Borders, former president of the WNBA, was named head of Time’s Up last year.

The organization was formed in January 2018 in response to sexual misconduct allegations leveled against powerful men in the entertainment industry including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.

Roger Stone apologizes to judge for Instagram post about her

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s longtime confidant Roger Stone has apologized to the judge presiding over his criminal case for an Instagram post featuring a photo of her with what appears to be the crosshairs of a gun.

Stone and his lawyers filed a notice Monday night saying Stone recognized “the photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted.”

Earlier Monday, Stone posted a photo of U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson with what appeared to be crosshairs near her head.

Stone later said that the picture had been “misinterpreted” and that any suggestion he intended to threaten Jackson was “categorically false.”

Stone is charged with lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering related to discussions he had during the 2016 election about WikiLeaks. He has denied guilt.

No plan for Smollett to do follow-up police interview Monday

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorneys for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives Monday for a follow-up interview about his reported assault.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to the latest edition of The 411 Douchebag of the Week. I’m Bryan Kristopowitz.

Before I get into the main part of this week’s edition, I just want you all to know that, yes, I am paying attention to the unfolding Jussie Smollett “he staged the attack against him” story, but I want to wait until we get official word from the Chicago authorities that he the actor did, in fact, stage the alleged hate crime against himself. As of Saturday night, when I’m writing this (I usually write this column on Sunday but, due to other commitments, I had to write it earlier than usual and if the story blew up on Sunday, that’s why it isn’t the main topic of this week’s column), there were rumors that because the two men arrested as potential perpetrators were set free and that the investigation “changed course,” likely meaning that the initial story of the attack wasn’t holding up to scrutiny. The police, however, haven’t said, officially, that that’s what happened. The police, as I understand it, are still investigating the case. So, until the world gets some sort of official, on the record “this is what we think happened” from the Chicago authorities, the Jussie Smollett story is a story that’s in progress. It doesn’t look good for the actor, but, at the same time, we don’t know what’s “really” going on. Yet. When we do, though, well, I’ll comment on it further.

I just wanted you all to know that, just in case you were wondering.

And now onto this week’s Douchebag of the Week.

This week, the 411 Douchebag of the Week goes to Douchebag Hall of Famer, comedy legend, and convicted rapist Bill Cosby, for his recent claim that he’s a “political prisoner” like Martin Luther King, Jr. Well, Cosby’s spokesperson Andrew Wyatt told Philadelphia TV station NBC 10 that Cosby told him he think he’s a political prisoner, so there’s a slight chance that there’s some miscommunication here from prisoner to spokesperson, but, really, what are the odds of that? Wyatt’s remarks sound like something Cosby would say since it was revealed that the once beloved stand-up comedian and TV star was a sexual predator. Cosby and his followers/believers still want you to believe that there’s a conspiracy against him. It’s just bullshit. And Cosby did release a statement through Wyatt, so there’s that, too.

A conspiracy? Who is conspiring against him? And why? What entity or “power structure” wanted him imprisoned? Cosby seems to think that the district attorney that prosecuted the case and the judge were corrupt and “needed” him to go to jail, but that makes no sense. Did the district attorney and the judge pay off the women that accused Cosby of sexual assault before the trial? Did the district attorney and or the judge pay off Andrea Constand, the woman Cosby drugged and raped? And how far back does this conspiracy go? Did it start before Bill Cosby became mega famous the world over?

Jesus Christ. Who the hell believes this shit?

And what sort of political stand did Cosby take over the years that made him a target of the conspiracy machine? Did Cosby really “try to humanize all races, genders, and religions?” And even if he did, why would that make him a target of this conspiracy?

Again, this is all just nonsense. Who the fuck believes any of it?

Cosby is likely going to have to serve out his entire ten year sentence, as he apparently refuses to participate in court mandated therapy sessions for sexual predators. “It’s entrapment!” and Cosby is innocent because he did nothing wrong. Will he even survive those ten years? Wouldn’t it make more sense for Cosby to just accept his fate, admit to what he did (and I don’t see how anyone can say he didn’t do what he was convicted of. It’s just ludicrous), do his time and do his therapy and get out after three years? Does Cosby actually think that he can come out of this with some semblance of his old reputation?

It isn’t going to happen, Mr. Cosby. Your life is over. Your reputation is never coming back. You’re a convicted sexual predator. You’re a political prisoner only in your own mind. Be honest with the world and yourself.

That isn’t going to happen, though, is it? Bill Cosby is going to keep claiming that he did nothing wrong.

What a fucking disgrace.

**

And now for this week’s honorable mentions…

– Douchebag Hall of Famer, 2018 Douchebag of the Year, and (Jesus Christ) 45th President of the United StatesDonald Trump, for for declaring a national emergency and then saying, in the press conference announcing the national emergency, that there really isn’t a national emergency. What kind of fucking bullshit is that? If there is no national emergency, why go through any of this shit beyond “fulfilling a major campaign promise?” And why aren’t more people outraged by this? This is fucking insane.

-WWE Superstar Jimmy Uso, for his recent DWI arrest. It’s bad enough that Uso was with this wife, fellow WWE Superstar and mega hot babe Naomi, both apparently drunk off their ass (Naomi was the driver and the police claim that she was driving the wrong way down a one-way street), but after the cops pulled them over and asked Naomi to get out of the car, Uso got out, too, took his shirt off, and then acted like he wanted to fight the cops. Even if you’re apparently drunker than shit, on what planet is any of that ever a good idea?

–The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Oscars, for its recent Oscar show plans. When the Oscars announced that it planned to cut four categories from this year’s live broadcast and have those cut categories announced during the commercial breaks, people from inside and outside of “the industry” freaked out. After several days and weeks of complaints and whatnot, the Oscars eventually agreed to just announce everything live like usual. Perhaps this wouldn’t have been such a huge deal if the Academy had explained, in detail, what it wanted to do and why it wanted to do it, but the Academy didn’t really do that. What it planned to do just sort of “got out there” and the controversy ensued. You’d think, after the Kevin Hart controversy, the Academy would have done more to minimize any more potential damage to its reputation.

–MTV, for for –doing that Lindsay Lohan beach show. I managed to get through about five minutes of Lindsay Lohan’s Beach Club before shutting it off and deleting it. For the love of God who the fuck at MTV thought this thing needed to be an ongoing show? Or a show at all? Are there really that many people out there wondering what Lohan is doing right now with her life?

Chicago — Chicago police said Sunday they're still seeking a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett after receiving new information that ""shifted"" their investigation of a reported attack on the ""Empire"" actor. Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources. ""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he said. Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview. Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

An apartment that was searched by police in connection with an investigation of an attack on actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. Two men characterized by police as ""persons of interest"" in the attack against Smollett are now considered suspects and have been arrested on ""probable cause that they may have committed a crime,"" a Chicago police spokesman said. Picture: Nader Issa/Chicago Sun-Times via AP

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a February 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

Now, let’s see if the perpetually triggered Hollywood Left — so ready to pile on the Trump hate — has the guts to stand tall and issue some major apologies.

To review, Smollett, 36, initially claimed Jan. 29 he was attacked around 2 a.m. by two white males who shouted racial and homophobic slurs, poured a bleach-like substance on him, and who said he was in “MAGA country” while placing a noose around his neck.

After the alleged attack, security video at his upscale apartment complex caught him entering the building holding his Subway sandwich and sporting the noose (which he still had on when police arrived to take his statement). What’s also noteworthy is that Smollett’s manager claimed to have heard the “MAGA country” slur, which makes him part of this story.

Early on, however, holes began to appear in Smollett’s story. He wouldn’t let police have his phone so they could check aspects of his story (such as his claim he was talking with his manager during the attack). While police discovered video of him traveling to the Subway and back to his apartment, strangely — in a video camera-heavy part of town — they couldn’t find any of the attack.

The big break came after police released video of two suspects seen walking away from the attack site; eventually, those suspects were arrested and questioned. They turned out to be Nigerian-born brothers Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, one of whom is Smollett’s personal trainer and who was an extra on the set of Empire.

As the story began to seriously fall apart, Smollett doubled down claiming, in a statement, that he was “angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with” — the Nigerian brothers.

Jussie Smollett update: Friends of Jussie, Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, are cooperating with investigators and @cbschicago says they reportedly told detectives that they did a practice run a few days before. They are claiming this was premeditated and rehearsed. — Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) February 17, 2019

But, as Breitbart News reports, Chicago PD now believe they have evidence to support that Smollett paid Abel and Ola to fabricate the assault — just so he could stoke fake outrage against POTUS Trump.

Don’t hold your breath for Hollywood’s lunatic liberals to apologize for being wrong — again

“Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault. The sources tell CNN that the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement,” tweeted CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz late Saturday.

CNN: Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault.

Earlier in the day, reports noted that police confirmed with the two brothers that they had done a “practice run” before the staged assault and that they purchased the rope later found around Smollett’s neck. What’s more, police have confirmed that the brothers were paid $3,500 each before taking a trip to Nigeria, then another $500 apiece when they returned.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” said Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

It was all a sick, twisted hoax, in other words. Now, where are the apologies from Hollywood after they all piled on the “Blame Trump Train?” (Related: Isn’t it time Chicago PD charged “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett with filing a fake hate crime report?)

Cher screamed on Twitter, “VILLAINY, RACISM,HOMOPHOBIA, PROMOTED BY MOST INFAMOUS [clown] IN [the world],IS THE POISON THAT KILLS [America].”

“[America] IS PPL OF COLOR,” she added. “GOP GOES DOWN WITH SHIP djt.”

Claimed actress Olivia Munn, sans evidence, “Jussie Smollett was violently attacked by two white men who poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck. He was targeted for being black and for being gay. THIS is why we have to have zero tolerance against homophobia and racism. Jussie’s life matters.”

“Heartbroken and furious reading about the attack on @JussieSmollett. I want Trump and all MAGA lunatics to burn in Hell,” screeched Billy Eichner.

We’re advising readers not to hold their breath for apologies.

Taking to social media Sunday for the second time since the supposed racist and homophobic attack in the early hours of January 29 in the Windy City, Empire executive producer Brett Mahoney was unequivocal in his language and meaning:

Empire broadcaster Fox, Donald Trump and others expressed support for the actor who portrays the gay Jamal Lyon on the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong co-created series in the immediate aftermath of attack. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” said 20th Century Fox TV and Fox Entertainment on February 14 when some local Chicago media were reporting that a possible exit from the series was the actor’s motivation to stage a “potential hate crime,” as the CPD called it, on himself.

“He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” the Fox units added on Valentine’s Day. Now, with the exception of Mahoney, the wide spread outrage over the assault on Smollett has been replaced by silence in recent days as the focus of the case has shifted.

The strong and reiterated belief from the showrunner and EP comes as the series continues production with Smollett and the investigation by the Chicago PD has seemingly centered its spotlight onto the actor himself. Detectives now want to question Smollett on if and how he was involved in the planning of the attack.

On February 15, the police released Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo without charges after initially considering the brothers suspects in the attack.

Authorities had identified the former Empire extra and his sibling as the “persons of interest” seen in the photographs snagged from the upscale Chicago neighborhood where Smollett lives and said he was assaulted violently with bleach poured over him and a rope thrown around his neck.

With a potential prosecution trigger to be pulled soon and ever-increasing whispers that police believe that Smollett may have orchestrated the whole thing, the Osundairos are now “fully” cooperating with the cops. Evidence seems to have emerged that Smollett’s personal trainer and his brother purchased the rope that Smollett had on him when he first spoke to police in the morning of January 29.

Smollett’s defense lawyers put out a seething statement on Saturday that the actor “has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.” They added bluntly, “nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Still, a law enforcement source told Deadline on Sunday that they have a “sense of frustration” over the lack of formal response for a further sit-down to go over new evidence that has come to light on the matter.

That frustration is fed in part by assurances from attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson that the actor will “continue to cooperate” with the investigation.

Speaking on Good Morning America on February 14 in his first interview since the January 29 incident, Smollett said he thought the attack occurred because of his high profile criticism of the former Celebrity Apprentice host. “I come really, really hard against 45,” the actor told GMA co-host Robin Roberts. “I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

Mahoney has remained consistent in his support of Smollett over the past three weeks since news of the attack first broke.

“Jussie is a proud, gay black man, and I’m not sure if the cowards were trying to beat the pride, gay or black out of him but he’s strong and we’re happy he’s back at work,” Mahoney said onstage during part of Fox’s TCA presentation on February 6.

Empire is set to return for the second half of its fifth season on March 13, with Smollett."

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in their statement.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett’s account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

This story has been corrected to show that the spokeswoman’s last name is Kavanagh, not Kavanaugh, and that the first name of Smollett’s character on the show is Jamal, not James.

One of Smollett’s newly retained attorneys, Todd Pugh, told the Sun-Times on Sunday that the actor and his legal team “expect to [be] back online tomorrow with the investigators.”

Pugh said a possible sit-down would depend on “scheduling availability.”

After the Police Department spent weeks saying Smollett was the victim of a possible hate crime last month in Streeterville, investigators may now be probing whether Smollett paid two brothers he knew from “Empire” to stage the attack, law enforcement sources told the Chicago Sun-Times.

New evidence provided to police during interrogations of the brothers — who are no longer considered suspects — “shifted the trajectory of the investigation” and has detectives wanting to question Smollett in a follow-up interview, according to police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

“We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with Mr. Smolette [sic],” another police spokesman, Tom Ahern, told the Sun-Times on Sunday.

Guglielmi said Sunday night, however, that police have not classified Smollett as an “offender.”

Detectives have discovered that one of the brothers bought the rope alleged to be used in the reported attack at a Crafty Beaver hardware store in Ravenswood, a law enforcement source said.

Smollett has told police he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 when two men walked up to him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him in the face, poured a substance — maybe bleach — on him and put a “thin, light rope” around his neck. The incident has been investigated as a hate crime.

Two men were taken into custody by police Wednesday night at O’Hare Airport after returning from a trip to Nigeria, their attorney Gloria Schmidt told reporters Friday. Detectives had believed they were the same men shown in a surveillance image released by police days after the purported attack, Guglielmi said at the time.

They were released Friday night without charges.

Smollett himself denied allegations that the attack was a hoax in an interview broadcast Thursday with anchor Robin Roberts on “Good Morning America” and called allegations he was lying “ridiculous.”"

He said his attackers had yelled racial and homophobic slurs towards him. He also said he had bleach thrown at him and a rope tied around his neck during the attack.

The Empire actor, who was in Chicago at the time of the incident, said his attackers were white.

In video footage of nearby areas, two Nigerian men were identified by police, the day after the attack. Despite the area where Jussie was attacked being filled with cameras, none of them were working on the day of the incident.

The two men taken in for questioning are known to Jussie, with the one having played a brief role on Empire and the other being the actor's personal trainer for a while.

CBS reported that the two men told police that Jussie had ""paid them"" to orchestrate the attack on him.

Jussie released a statement through his attorney's denying that he had any involvement in his own attack saying that ""nothing is further from the truth.""

Police released the men and said that they would be re-interviewing the actor.

Meanwhile, American media have warned people not to jump to conclusions and wait for police to make an announcement on the case. Some media have again reiterated that the video footage of the men was from the day after the incident."

Authorities said the case ""shifted"" and they want to speak with Smollett again. Smollett's spokeswoman, Pamela Sharp, told WGN Sunday there were no updates ""as of now"" and another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanaugh, could not confirm if Smollett agreed to another interview.

""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote on Twitter Sunday.

Smollett, 36, claimed he was attacked by two men in the early hours of Jan. 29 when he was walking to his Chicago apartment. He said the men yelled racial and homophobic slurs, threw an unknown chemical at him and put a rope around his neck.

On Friday, two brothers, Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, were arrested and released hours later without being charged. Guglielmi said the two were released after they were interviewed and provided ""new evidence.""

Law enforcement sources told local news outlets the brothers told detectives that Smollett paid them to take part in the alleged attack and bought the rope found around the actor's neck. They reportedly said they were paid $3,500 before they left for Nigeria on the day of the attack and were promised $500 once they returned to Chicago. They also reportedly said they rehearsed the attack ""days"" before it happened.

Smollett's defense layers, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued another statement Saturday night, insisting he did not play a ""role in his own attack.""

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

The attorneys said one of the men interviewed by police is a personal trainer hired to get Smollett ready ""physically for a music video.""

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,"" the statement read.

They said Smollett will continue to cooperate with police, adding, ""At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.""

During an appearance on Good Morning America last week, Smollett called rumors the attack was a hoax ""offensive.""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" Smollett said. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.""

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had “shifted” — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police “are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

“And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,” Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push “the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.”

The response from Smollett’s celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn’t know what to say, but that the situation is a “mess” and a “travesty.”

“I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

“I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,” Gay wrote. “Because more often than not they are telling the truth.”"

An investigation into an alleged attack on an openly gay black actor has ""shifted"" and police are now seeking a follow-up interview with the ""Empire"" cast member, a spokesman said Sunday.

Jussie Smollett, 36, reported to police on January 29 that two men beat him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck while he walked downtown in the third-largest American city.

The announced change in direction came two days after police said that the two ""potential suspects"" in the attack had been released without charge and as US media outlets reported that the attack may have been staged.

""The information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview,"" he added.

Multiple US media outlets reported the two men are brothers who were arrested at Chicago's O'Hare airport upon their return from a trip to Nigeria.

At least one of the men reportedly worked on ""Empire,"" a TV series about the fortunes of a hip-hop mogul and his family battling over control of a multi-million-dollar music company.

In an emotional interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" broadcast Thursday, Smollett gave details of the purported attack and said he was angry at doubts about its veracity.

Smollett said a masked man yelled ""Empire"" as the actor was walking through an intersection after a late-night stop at a sandwich shop.

After he ignored the man, Smollett said the attacker yelled out a racial slur and used President Donald Trump's campaign slogan acronym ""MAGA,"" which stands for ""Make America Great Again.""

Smollett said the man called Chicago ""MAGA country"" and then punched him in the face, at which point the actor fought with the attacker, and was kicked by a second man he had not noticed earlier.

""It felt like minutes, but it was probably like 30 seconds, honestly,"" Smollett said.

Initial reports of the attack shocked the entertainment industry and brought waves of support from advocacy groups and senior politicians, including Democratic presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand."

On Sunday, the Bronx-based rapper uploaded an Instagram live video where she, while eating lobster, pondered the latest developments in the unpredictable and divisive case.

'I am really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, whatever the f*** his name is. I'm really disappointed in him.

'I feel like he f***d up Black History Month bro. Like damn. I'm not going to say yet until he said out his mouth at it was fake and staged, I don't want to completely blame him because you know like somebody, that I was talking to, they said that police in Chicago are racist so they might try to frame him and make him look like he's a liar, but if he's not then bro you f***d up for real.

'Why would you do that? Then you f****** give Donald Trump immunity to f****** laugh at n*****s and s**t,' she said.

Some said they were waiting for more information before passing judgement again, and others questioned the integrity of the Chicago Police Department which has a historically racist reputation.

'Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t,' said director Ava DuVernay.

Reporter: Tonight, police telling ABC news the two brothers seen in this surveillance video claim ""Empire"" star jussie smollett paid them to carry out a fabricated homophobic attack. Sources say detectives are actively investigating that allegation. Who the Would make something like this up, or add something to it, or -- or whatever it may be? I can't -- I can't even -- I'm an advocate. Reporter: Now smollett doubling down on his story as police probe whether he staged a hoax. The actor's criminal defense attorney saying in a statement, ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation,"" smollett is ""Angered and devastated"" by the suggestion he was involved in the alleged attack. ""Nothing is further from the truth, and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" I'm -- off. What is it that has you so angry? Is it the attackers? It's the attackers. But it's also the attacks. Reporter: Chicago police saying they urgently want to talk to smollett, now waiting to hear back from his attorneys. Investigators also combing through phone records to see whether the brothers spoke to smollett the night of the alleged incident. They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna do that. Why? Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers. Reporter: The brothers now said to be cooperating with police after being confronted with evidence they bought the rope found around smollett's neck. Authorities confirming they had a previous relationship with smollett. The star telling our robin Roberts earlier this week he was sure the men in that shadowy video were his attackers. I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. Never did. Reporter: But now, in that statement, smollett's attorneys saying one of the brothers was his personal trainer, claiming, ""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against jussie or would falsely claim jussie's complicity."" If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal? I don't know. Let's just hope that they are. You know what I'm saying? Let's -- let's not go there yet. Erielle, authorities still want to talk to smollett. That hasn't happened yet. And if he's convicted, he could face serious prison time? Yes, he could face charges for filing a false police report, that's a felony in Illinois, with a punishment of up to three years in prison. But again, the case is still being investigated.

Unfortunately for Nancy, the internet never forgets.

Pelosi is just one snowflake in an avalanche of liberals who accepted Smollett's bizarre story without so much as questioning the logic behind two Trump supporters, who watch Empire, out at 2 a.m. in a wealthy Chicago enclave, who not only recognized Smollett - but knew he was gay, and happened to be packing a bleach-like substance and a noose (in ""MAGA Country).

The Speaker of the House wasn't alone in her uncritical support of Smollett - who faces up to three years in prison if charged and found guilty of filing a false police report.

As the Daily Caller's Kerry Pickett notes, 2020 Democratic contenders Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Corey Booker (D-NJ) have yet to delete their tweets.

Booker - another kneejerk snowflake in the avalanche of MAGA-hate, called the Smollett ""attack"" a ""modern day lynching.""

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.

Harris parroted Booker 90 minutes later, also calling it a ""modern day lynching.""

Oddly, quickdraw Booker seems be taking his sweet time time figuring out what he thinks of the Smollett situation now that his two Nigerian friends have apparently flipped on the Empire star and accused him of paying them to stage the attack - practicing beforehand and purchasing the rope and red hats used in the ""MAGA Country"" attack.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) refuses to comment until the facts come out on the allegations that Jussie Smollett orchestrated the attack

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”– a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more."

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he said.

Smollett, an actor in the show “Empire” who’s black and gay, told police two white men shouting racial and homophobic slurs put a noose around his neck, poured chemicals on him and told him, “This is MAGA country.” Police now suspect Smollett set the alleged attack up himself, paying two Nigerian men he knew to carry out the attack, according to reports.

Advocates say most hate-crime reports — which have been on the rise in recent years, according to the federal government — are not found to be fake, but there have been a string of high-profile hoaxes over the past several years.

Last month, a Native American man in Washington D.C. made national headlines after he said a group of MAGA-hatted teens confronted and mocked him after he and they were coming from different marches. Video later showed that the man, Nathan Phillips, had sought out the confrontation and gotten in one of the teens’ faces.

Last November, a student at Kansas State tweeted out a picture of what she said was a racist note placed on her door. Following an investigation, police said the student admitted placing the note there herself.

In November 2016, a 20-year-old admitted he lied when he told Malden cops he was harassed by two men who he said used a racial slur, referenced lynching and proclaimed it’s “Trump country now.”

Five black Air Force Academy cadets in 2017 found racial slurs written near their rooms, leading to the school’s superintendent delivering a stern speech against racism in a viral and widely-praised video. But authorities later said one of the five cadets had written the messages.

Farther back, in Lunenburg, Mass., in 2013, police said the mother of a biracial teenager who was a member of the football team spray painted a racial slur on the side of their home, prompting vigils and a suspension of the football program."

“People can just throw the word ‘racist’ out there without and real justification or dialogue about it, and it becomes something that becomes very hard to defend,” said Geoff Diehl, a former state rep and U.S. senate candidate who co-chaired Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts.

Smollett, who is black and gay, told Chicago police that he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racist and anti-gay slurs and telling him, “This is MAGA country!”

The actor and singer said the attackers looped a rope around his neck and poured a chemical on him before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Police originally investigated the report as a hate crime, but sources have told various media outlets that the department now suspects Smollett set the whole thing up himself. The wheels started to fall off of Smollett’s claims after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, according to a police spokesman, who said cops now want to talk to the actor again.

Anne Kavanagh, spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday she couldn’t comment on whether he had agreed to another interview with police.

The police had described the two men as suspects, but said they are not longer under suspicion after interviewing them and searching their apartment.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in a statement.

Smollett’s lawyers also said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Local fans of President Trump, however, say the rush to conclusions is just the latest in a series of incidents where the media and the political left was quick to exploit an incident that could be used to make the president and his supporters look bad.

New Hampshire state Rep. Al Baldasaro, a former Trump campaign adviser, said, “Anything dealing with Trump, they’re jumping on the bandwagon without looking at the facts. It gets aggravating — they keep saying it over and over that we’re racist.”

Alex Veras, a Republican from Haverhill, said liberals are going after Trump like this because they’re “at their wits’ end” — and that kind of response just lends credence to Trump’s claims that the media and left are out to get him.

Veras, who himself is Hispanic, added of Smollett, “He did a grave injustice to people of color, to the gay community — because these things really do happen.”

The incident took place in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where police say the Tennessee resident was shopping at the Sam’s Club store. As WNKY reported, Phillips saw a man and woman wearing MAGA hats and made an obscene gesture with his finger. The man then confronted Phillips, returning the gesture and sparking an argument.

It was then that police say Phillips pulled a .40 caliber Glock that he had concealed in his right rear pocket. Phillips had a conceal carry permit for his home state of Tennessee, which is also valid in Kentucky.

Other shoppers in the store called 911, saying that Phillips threatened the couple as he pulled the gun. Police arrived and arrested the 57-year-old man.

The story of Phillips’ arrest gained national attention, with many pointing out that there have been similar attacks on Trump supporters that have not gotten as much attention as acts of violence that were carried out by Trump’s supporters.

Man arrested for pulling a gun on Sams Club shopper because he was wearing a MAGA hat. https://t.co/RxZPcMwFT5 — Mark Dice (@MarkDice) February 18, 2019

This is the latest viral incident in connection with Trump’s trademark red campaign hat. Critics have called the hat a symbol of hatred, and actress Alyssa Milano sparked controversy when she compared the hat to a white Ku Klux Klan hood.

“The red MAGA hat is the new white hood,” she tweeted in response to an incident in which it appeared students from Covington Catholic high school were taunting a Native American man at the March for Life rally. “Without white boys being able to empathize with other people, humanity will continue to destroy itself.”

The MAGA hat was also at the center of an allegedly hoax attack against Empire actor Jussie Smollett. The actor claimed that two men wearing MAGA hats beat him on a night at the end of January while he was walking on a Chicago street, shouting “This is MAGA country!”

The allegations have since come under suspicion, with Chicago police saying that the focus of the investigation has turned to Smollett amid allegations that he worked with two other men to stage the attack.

Critics say that his story was an attempt to stir up anger and hatred toward supporters of Donald Trump.

In Kentucky, James Phillips was arrested and charged with first-degree wanton endangerment for pulling a gun on the couple wearing MAGA hats."

The Jussie Smollett claim of a racial and homophobic attack in late January in Chicago by two white men wearing MAGA hats is falling apart.

The story was suspicious from the start. While not impossible, it was improbable that two white guys were running around Chicago in the middle of the night during a sub-zero Polar Vortex wearing MAGA hats while carrying bleach and a noose and just happened to find a high-profile gay black actor to attack.

Democrat politicians ran with the story as a cudgel against Trump and Trump supporters.

Yet even more fervor was shown by the mainstream and entertainment media, who fell all over each other to amplify Smollett’s claims without critical analysis. The media out-hustled the politicians on this story to tell an anti-Trump narrative smearing Trump supporters, particularly those who wear MAGA hats, as racist, homophobic and violent.

Non-liberal media is pointing the finger at the media role. As Sean Davis noted:

News media hopped from the laughable Steele dossier, to CNN’s bogus Don Jr. emails scoop, to BuzzFeed’s bogus Michael Cohen scoop, to the vile Covington smears, to the obvious Jussie Smollett hoax, and yet journos wonder why people say “Learn to code” when they finally get fired.

While the current specific hoaxes and accusations are new, the media tactic is not.

I covered the media mistreatment of the Tea Party starting in 2009, and the same pattern took hold: An act or alleged act of violence immediately was blamed on Tea Party supporters in the absence of actual evidence that the alleged perpetrator was a Tea Party supporter, and in many cases where there was evidence the alleged perpetrator was liberal or leftist.

It all was for the purpose of portraying Tea Party supporters specifically and the “right-wing” more generally as “eliminationist,” people who were prone to political violence:

It started with Bill Sparkman, the part-time Census worker who went missing and then was found dead, setting off an avalanche of mainstream media and left-blogosphere accusations that he was the victim of anti-government “right-wing” hate. It turned out that Sparkman killed himself, but there were few if any apologies coming. The Sparkman accusations were based on nothing more than a desire to demonize the newly formed and rapidly growing Tea Party movement as terrorists and un-American. It was as if they were hoping for an act of Tea Party violence.

The false eliminationist narrative directed at the Tea Party went on for years, aided and abetted by Democrat operative groups like Think Progress and by establishment Republicans who hated the Tea Party.

The prolonged — to this day — attempt to blame Sarah Palin for the shooting of Gabby Giffords by Jared Loughner was one of the worst examples, but just one of many that we covered.

In each of these cases, when the hoax or false narrative was exposed, the mainstream media no longer was around, they had moved on, leaving the false perception that Tea Party supporters were dangerous and violent.

Nothing has changed, other than the names and faces. The media still plays the role of creating false narratives that ordinary law-abiding Americans who oppose liberals are dangerous and prone to violence.

Watch how they will run from their complicity in the Jussie Smollett story, how they will try to blame Smollett and society at large for their own journalistic malfeasance and political bias.

Simon'],https://static.pjmedia.com/rogerlsimon/user-content/12/files/2019/02/images-1.sized-770x415xt.jpeg,"['aoc', 'magical', 'heights', 'dems', 'media', 'young', 'thinking', 'believe', 'reach', 'trump', 'ago', 'smollett', 'left']","What’s with the left? Why have they so abandoned logic and reason that not only do they contradict virtually everything they stood for ten years ago (secure borders, etc.), their spokespeople have gone so far off the deep end as to embrace the incoherent proposals of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (no high-paying jobs for Long Island!) and to encourage the extraordinarily bizarre and increasingly hysterical narrative of Jussie Smollett?

It is as if the Democratic Party has decided, once and for all, to adopt the psychological concept of “Magical Thinking” as its modus vivendi.

Good Therapy defines magical thinking as “the belief that one’s own thoughts, wishes, or desires can influence the external world. It is common in very young children. A four-year-old child, for example, might believe that after wishing for a pony, one will appear at his or her house.”

MT pops up in various guises from a child believing in Santa Claus to adults adhering to numerous utopian cults, secular and religious. That communism would result, as Marx declared, in the “withering away of the state” was one form of magical thinking. Political correctness, in essence, is also magical thinking because there is no such thing, nor should there ever be. It’s almost as oxymoronic as “settled science.”

Democrats (liberals and progressives in general) have been headed in the direction of magical thinking for some time and, in fact, have been well over the line since the advent of Trump. Remember, moments after the inauguration, thousands of women marching through the streets of our major cities wearing pudenda hats because something terrible was about to happen to their sex? Nothing did.

That was only the beginning. That was followed by a raft of accusations that Trump, the most pro-Israel president in memory, with Jewish grandchildren, was an anti-Semite and to blame for some isolated swastikas. He wasn’t. And it went on from there.

Calling this Trump Derangement Syndrome is an understatement because it’s more psychologically disturbing than a mere political catchphrase can capture. With Smollett and AOC, this actual psychopathology — because that’s what it is — has reached new heights, in an apotheosis of magical thinking.

In the case of Smollett, it was not only assumed his “attack” was a “hate crime,” it was actively wished for as such. Many on the left seriously willed it to be hate to validate their imaginary (i. e. magical) conception of the other side as evil and racist. They were fairly chortling all over Twitter — or offering Jussie their sincerest condolences for the unforgivable offense. An amazing number seemed to have known or met him.

Of course, it’s becoming obvious how wrong they were. But look back at the numerous tweets that appeared, many from famous liberal celebrities, none questioning even for a second what had occurred, even though the facts were always at the very least suspicious to even a casual observer. That Smollett would believe he could get away with such an outlandish hoax speaks not just to his own unbalanced psyche but to the zeitgeist. A wildly biased media could be relied upon, he undoubtedly thought, to back him up on almost any absurd claim where Donald Trump was even remotely concerned.

He was almost right. The media are that enmeshed in their own version of magical thinking. The Smollett affair burst on the scene only days after the supposed racism of the Catholic boys (Covington kids) against a Native American was disproven, but that message was apparently forgotten in an instant, assuming it was ever received. As the Loving Spoonful asked years ago, “Do you believe in magic?” Only this time, it’s not in a young girl’s heart. It’s, as The Shadow used to say, in evil lurking within the hearts of men (and women) who make the claim of being liberal, whatever that means. They should examine it.

In the case of AOC, her Seventh-day Adventist-style “end times” warning of a world ending in twelve years should have been met with a bit of skepticism (or possibly a guffaw) considering it was exactly twelve years ago that Al Gore made myriad similar predictions in his An Inconvenient Truth documentary, not one of which came true. Gore himself got filthy rich from the endeavor (will AOC?), even though the documentary was deemed propaganda in the UK. As Patrick Moore, the former president of Greenpeace, put it, “There is no definitive scientific proof through real-world observation that carbon dioxide is responsible for any of the slight warming of global climate which has occurred during the past 300 years.”

That AOC wants to completely revamp the U.S. economy — and undoubtedly impoverish the working class in the process for this chimera — is not amazing, even though she comes from a working-class neighborhood herself (go figure). There are useful idiots in every generation and doubtless always will be. What is scary is how many people want to believe her, how many are so invested in this form of magical thinking they are willing to abandon their critical faculties.

Unwinding this is not going to be easy. The therapeutic community is, alas, awash in the same manner of thinking and then some. But the left may have gone so far into the magical realm this time that the old silent majority, what Kurt Schlichter calls “the Normals,” may be shaking their heads and starting to act. Things are beginning to backfire, sometimes with surprising speed.

Keep on shaking. Meanwhile… do you believe in magic?

In pushing back against that, there is an emerging effort to draw distinction between rapid fire activists and celebrities on social media, and members of the press.

Dave Weigel of the Washington Post, for example, made the distinction in a Tweet on Sunday.

Twitter often blurs “the media” into a blob of celebrities, pundits, and randos, and it does a disservice to the reporters who covered this story the right way. https://t.co/oIabRr00Lk — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) February 17, 2019

On CNN’s Reliable Sources, Vox’s Liz Plank emphatically made this point, saying she couldn’t find “a real reputable media outlet reporting” that the attack was motivated by MAGA or included a statement about “MAGA country. “I couldn’t find one,” she said. “We can’t confuse celebrity tweets with the media and the press.”

This is a fine idea, and there should be some distinction when referring to the media at large, but in this case the facts simply don’t bear out the premise that the press was not involved in an early pile-on. In fact, dozens of reporters Tweeted these very things, on the day the story broke.

These are only some of the examples. Take a look at these reporters/members of the press/journalists, from…

April Ryan is, of course, a very high profile White House correspondent for Urban Radio Networks, and is a regular contributor on CNN. That’s not second-guessers or critics blurring a line, that’s a journalist doing the thing that we’re being told they didn’t do.

Mara Liasson of NPR appeared on MediaBuzz on Fox News to talk about the media reaction with Howard Kurtz. The two discussed the difference between jumping the gun and simply reporting on the latest information, and there is a difference. Liasson and Kurtz also it would be equally irresponsible to jump the gun now and declare the Smollett case decided in the other direction. Absolutely true, and collecting the above tweets does not imply otherwise. But it does show that the notion that members of the press were studiously avoiding piling-on after the TMZ story broke are simply not correct. Many, many, many did.

There is a big push to fight fake news by naming, shaming, and driving off of social media those would propagate it. Usually these are far out there people like conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who is by no stretch a journalist. This push is on the grounds that the influence and ability to spread false info are damaging and should be stopped. Yet here, there is an effort to say it doesn’t matter what someone famous says, only what a journalist says.

That is a relevant point not because the Smollett story is the same as, for example, an Infowars story, but because the principle of differentiating between press and people who are merely famous is applicable in both cases. That is, either it is worth differentiating between journalists and everyone else, or it is not.

Much like Kmele Foster on CNN, over on FNC, Mara Liasson’s advice to reporters was “just wait before you tweet.” Sound advice for anyone.

Editors’ note: Jussie Smollett is now yet another hoax victim in the ongoing and endless narrative of the Unholy Alliance's fake and self-made 'hate-crimes.' The leftist establishment media, doing its faithful Unholy Alliance duty, uncritically embraced and sensationalized Smollett’s elaborate “hate crime” story -- of him being a victim of assault of white supremacist, homophobic Trump supporters. But, again, it turns out to be all untrue. In light of this new, but very expected, development, Frontpage has deemed it important to bring attention to this escalating phenomenon of fake “hate crimes” that very conveniently serve the Unholy Alliance's agenda.



We are therefore reprinting, below, Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov’s article, The ‘Hate-Crime’ Victims Of Trump Who Weren’t, from the November 18, 2016 issue of The Daily Caller, which reveals how totalitarian movements portray themselves in order to gain power. This phenomenon is at the core of Glazov's new book, Jihadist Psychopath, which unveils how the Leftist-Islamic matrix masks itself in victimhood while being the actual abuser and perpetrator.

The ‘Hate-Crime’ Victims Of Trump Who Weren’t.

The deranged fantasy world of the totalitarian cry-bully.

By Jamie Glazov

Daily Caller, November 18, 2016.

To gain power, totalitarian movements always portray themselves as victims. And while they are in the process of abusing, they cry in front of the world posing as the abused. They stage “hate-crime” attacks against themselves because hate crimes are their political and cultural capital. When those hate-crimes don’t exist, they must be invented.

We are witnessing precisely this phenomenon at this very moment in regards to the myriad hoax “hate-crimes” that anti-Trump forces are manufacturing out of thin air and blaming on Trump supporters. The media are bolstering the entire hallucination process, with CNN leading the way.

Central to the whole narrative is the supposed “Islamophobic” anti-Muslim crime-wave sweeping the nation. The rumors spread and the media regurgitates the lies without any evidence to back them up. And then, after the hoaxes are debunked one by one, the media is, by that time, bored and no longer interested.

The latest “Islamophobia” counterfeit involves a Muslim student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (ULL). The Muslima alleged that her hijab and wallet were stolen by two white Trump supporters who were shouting racial slurs. The woman’s accusation incensed leftists and Muslims across the nation and the world, prompting the ACLU of Louisiana to issue a statement denouncing both the incident and, of course, Donald Trump. The investigation into the incident involved several law enforcement agencies, including the FBI. The Washington Post, New York Times and CNN, meanwhile, ate the story up.

But what happened to this Muslima’s story under tough police questioning? Well, the ULL student eventually broke down and admitted to police that she had fabricated the entire thing. By that time, of course, the media wasn’t too interested in such an innocuous little detail.

Recently, The Huffington Post reported on an incident of “Islamophobia” under the headline “Islamophobia Just Drove This Boy And His Family Out Of America.” It was all so heartbreaking and unjust. The one little problem with the story, however, was that it never happened.

Trump supporters, meanwhile, are supposedly involved in a lot of other evil than just attacking Muslim women on campuses and driving little Muslim boys out of America:

A gay Canadian filmmaker, Chris Ball, was alleged to have been beaten up by Trump supporters on election night in Santa Monica. It was upsetting, but it turned out the incident never really happened at all.

An image also recently went viral online that purported to show KKK members in North Carolina celebrating Donald Trump’s victory. It was really awful. And it was also confirmed to be a hoax. The proof of the hoax, however, didn’t go viral.

Many other hoaxes of Trump-induced terror are being debunked as we speak.

All of these “hate-crime” fabrications made up by the anti-Trump forces are nothing new. They are a completely natural ingredient of how totalitarians operate and, hence, how the Unholy Alliance of the Left and Islam operates. Shillman Fellow Daniel Greenfield explains this phenomenon in the context of the Left:

“The left is a victimhood cult. It feeds off pain and fetishizes suffering as a moral commodity to be sold and resold in exchange for political power.”

Greenfield calls this leftist charade “victimocracy” and labels its foot soldier the “cry-bully” who is, in reality, the “abuser-victim.” This monster, Greenfield writes, is

“the abuser who pretends to be a victim. His arguments are his feelings. He comes armored in identity politics entitlement and is always yelling about social justice or crying social justice tears. If you don’t fight back, the cry-bully bullies you. If you fight back, the cry-bully cries and demands a safe space because you made him feel unsafe.”

Thus, because now the Unholy Alliance maniacs feel “unsafe” because they didn’t get their way in the election, it becomes very clear why it’s crucial for them to play the victim – and, most importantly, to fabricate “hate-crimes” being perpetrated against themselves. Greenfield explains:

“If cry-bullies can’t safe-bait you, they will manufacture threats by faking hate crimes against themselves or phoning in bomb threats to validate their need for a safe space in which no one is allowed to disagree with them. Surviving their own fake crimes turns cry-bullies into social justice heroes.”

Islamic supremacists play a key part in this story. And since the Left controls our culture and boundaries of discourse, it makes complete sense that the media, instead of focusing on how the Muslim community should make Americans feel safe by repudiating Islamic texts that inspire and sanction violence against unbelievers, instead amplify the narrative that it is Muslims who are afraid and that it is non-Muslim Americans who need to make Muslims feel safe. Leading scholar of Islam Robert Spencer explains this charade, unveiling why Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as the CAIR need there to be hate crimes against Muslims so badly:

“The Hamas-linked Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) wants and needs hate crimes against Muslims, because they’re the currency they use to buy power and influence in our victimhood-oriented society, and to deflect attention away from jihad terror and onto Muslims as putative victims.”

This is why the Muslima at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette fabricated the “hate-crime” against herself. And it is also why her lie is only the latest example in a long list of so many other Muslim counterfeit stories.

Just to list a few of the typical and notorious incidents:

In February 2016, a Michigan Muslima, Said Chatti, was arraigned in Dearborn’s 18th District Court for making a false police report about an “Islamophobic” plot to bomb Dearborn Fordson High School, a majority-Muslim high school. She contacted the Dearborn Police Department and claimed that an “anonymous” friend of hers overheard a group of individuals plotting to blow up the school to retaliate against the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. When the police presented her with the evidence of the holes in her story, she admitted it was a false report.

In December 2015, a 37-year-old Muslim man, Gary Nathaniel Moore of Houston, was charged with first-degree arson for setting a Houston mosque on fire on Christmas day – a mosque where he himself was a regular, having attended it for five years, coming five times per day to pray seven days per week. Using surveillance video from multiple businesses nearby, investigators were able to identify Moore and a search warrant of his home recovered a backpack and clothing similar to that which was seen in surveillance footage, as well as half of a two-pack of charcoal lighter-fluid bottles that seemed to match another lighter fluid bottle found inside the mosque.

In March 2012, we beheld the murder of Muslima Shaima Alawadi. At first reported as a “hate-crime,” it then turned out to be an honor murder. The media and Unholy Alliance were extremely vocal and indignant while the murder was a hate-crime, even staging a campaign, “One Million Hijabs for Shaima Alawadi.” But once the murder turned out to be an Islamic crime, Shaima turned out not to matter to even one of the activists who had, at one point, made so much noise and howled so many cries of indignation.

The list goes on and on: a Muslim woman in England was proven to have lied to police about claiming to have been punched in the face for wearing a hijab; a Muslim woman in Dearborn dropped a lawsuit against police after video proved she was lying when claiming they forced her to remove her hijab; a supposed “hit-and-run” on a Muslim woman in Brussels blamed on “far right” anti-Islam demonstrators turned out to be perpetrated by a Muslim named “Mohamed.”

Many more of these Muslim victimization fantasies and lies have been documented by Robert Spencer in his special report, “The Top Anti-Muslim Hate Crime Hoaxes of 2014,” and in his recent video, Yet Another “Islamophobic Hate Crime” Hoax.

And so, we come to see that faking hate-crimes is a long and standard tradition of the cry-bully, and the Unholy Alliance is the premier cry-bully of our modern age. With Trump’s victory now a reality, the Left/Islam forces are foaming at the mouth and gnashing their teeth.

And while they set fires and break windows, brutally beat young girls for liking Trump, break the faces of those they think look like Trump and injure police officers, they cry and whine because they are the real victims of real hate-crimes. But, as the evidence reveals, these are the hate-crimes perpetrated by the Trump supporters who might have been — and inflicted on the victims who weren’t."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is Black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts.

Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may

hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had “shifted” — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police “are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

“And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,” Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push “the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.”

The response from Smollett’s celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn’t know what to say, but that the situation is a “mess” and a “travesty.”

“I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

“The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait,” DuVernay said.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

“I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,” Gay wrote. “Because more often than not they are telling the truth.”

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had “shifted” — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police “are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

“And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,” Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push “the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.”

The response from Smollett’s celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn’t know what to say, but that the situation is a “mess” and a “travesty.”

“I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

“I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,” Gay wrote. “Because more often than not they are telling the truth.”"

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

Less than three weeks after being indicted on 16 felony counts, Chicago prosecutors on Tuesday dropped all charges against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who had been accused of filing a false police report claiming he was the victim of a hate crime attack carried out by two men on a city street in January.

Here is what else we know in the twisting timeline of events:

Initial report

On Jan. 29, Smollett filed a report with the Chicago Police Department stating that he had gone out for food at around 2 a.m. after returning from New York, when masked men hurled racist and homophobic slurs before beating him. The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay also said his attackers poured what he believed was bleach over him and put a noose around his neck in the upscale neighborhood of Streeterville. Many celebrities, including ""Empire"" cast members and gay rights advocates showed their support for Smollett on social media.

Possible hate crime

From the onset, the police department said it was investigating the alleged attack as a possible hate crime.

'Persons of interest'

Chicago police said on Jan. 30 that a thorough review of security video in the alleged assault and battery on Smollett revealed ""potential persons of interest"" that investigators would like to question. Officials released pictures from a surveillance camera located near where Smollett says he was attacked. Before that break, the case seemed to stall as detectives reviewed hundreds of hours of security and other types of video and came up with no leads.

Decline to share phone records

On Jan. 31, Chicago police said Smollett declined to provide telephone records that could show he was speaking with his manager just as the alleged assault happened, which he had claimed. The manager had told police he heard the attackers say, ""This is MAGA country,"" during the assault, officials said.

President Donald Trump weighed in that day from the Oval Office saying that the attack was ""horrible"" and that it ""doesn’t get worse.""

Smollett family speaks out

On the same day, authorities said Smollett refused to turn over his cellphone to investigators, his family released a statement saying: ""We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""

Treating him like a victim

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson told NBC Chicago on Feb. 1 that detectives would not demand Smollett hand over his cellphone or phone records. Johnson said the allegations as described to police ""are horrendous, horrible, and quite frankly cowardly.""

""He is a victim, and we treat him like a victim. He's been very cooperative,"" Johnson said.

'100% factual'

Smollett released his first official statement on Feb. 1, thanking family, friends and fans for their support in the wake of the alleged attack.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Partial records turned over

Smollett on Feb. 11 gave detectives partial records of his cellphone usage, marking 13 days since the alleged assault. The actor gave investigators a PDF file containing a redacted list of his calls, a police spokesman told NBC News.

Anger at those who doubted his story

In his first interview about the incident, the actor told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he was angry about the alleged attack and at those who doubted his story.

Social media users began to cast doubt over his claims after police said they were not able to find video of the alleged attack.

Smollett said he didn't want to hand over his phone because he has ""private pictures and videos and numbers,"" and he was already wary because of the way some reacted to his account of the attack.

He also said that he believed if he had claimed his attacker was a minority, no one would have doubted him.

'Persons of interest' identified

On Feb. 14, hours after the airing of Smollett's ABC News interview, Chicago police announced that ""through meticulous investigation"" they had identified two persons of interest.

The men being questioned by police were two Nigerian brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, that investigators said were the same two men seen in the surveillance video pictures they had released.

Police later said they searched at least one property in connection with their investigation but still had no motive for the attack.

Guglielimi said Feb. 15 that the Osundairo brothers had been arrested on suspicion that they may have been involved in a crime, but they hadn't been charged in the attack. Guglielimi added that at least one of the men worked on ""Empire.""

Reports of a hoax deemed unconfirmed

Guglielmi tweeted Feb. 14 that local reports surfacing that the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed.

He said Johnson had contacted one Chicago news outlet to inform them that ""their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

'Pleased there is progress'

In a statement to NBC News earlier on Feb. 14, a representative for Smollett welcomed the identification of two persons of interest.

""We are pleased there is progress in the case and are waiting to hear further details,"" his representative said.

Released due to new evidence

On the night of Feb. 15, police said they released the two men who had been questioned in the case without charge, and that they are no longer considered suspects.

Probe shifts to whether actor staged incident

On Feb. 16, a police source familiar with the investigation told NBC News that the probe has shifted into whether the actor paid two men who were questioned in the case to stage an assault.

A Chicago police spokesman said Saturday night that ""the trajectory of the investigation"" changed.

""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview,"" the spokesman said.

Smollett’s attorneys denied any suggestion that the actor was complicit. They said Smollett is the victim of a hate crime and that he has been cooperative with police.

'Follow-ups to complete'

The Chicago Police department on Feb. 17 said investigators need to speak with Smollett after a police source had confirmed to NBC News and other media outlets that the probe had shifted into whether the actor paid two men who were questioned in the case to stage an assault.

""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,"" Chicago police spokesman Guglielmi said in a tweet.

'No plans to meet with police'

Attorneys for Smollett said that he would not be meeting with Chicago police on Feb. 18, after the department said it needed to conduct follow-up interviews with him regarding the alleged attack he reported last month.

""There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett's attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf,"" said Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson.

Top prosecutor recuses herself

The top prosecutor in the Chicago area, Cook County State’s Attorney Kimberly Foxx, on Feb. 19 recused herself from the case.

The state's attorney stepped away from the matter because she had had ""conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department,"" a spokesperson for the office said.

'Consummate professional'

On Feb. 20, Fox studio denied a report that Smollett's scenes on ""Empire"" had been significantly reduced in the wake of suggestions that he may have staged the attack on himself.

'Considered a suspect'

Smollett was charged Feb. 20 with felony disorderly conduct for the allegedly false report he made with Chicago police. He turned himself in the next day.

""Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony),"" police spokesman Guglielmi announced in a tweet. ""Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.""

'Enjoys presumption of innocence'

In a statement released after Smollett was charged, his attorneys said he ""enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.""

""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,"" attorneys Pugh and Henderson said.

'Took advantage of pain and anger of racism'

Johnson accused Smollett of staging the attack on himself because he was unhappy with his salary on ""Empire.""

""This announcement today recognizes that 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Johnson said at a news conference.

Police also said Smollett sent himself a letter containing racist language, and when that did not work, he paid the Osundairo brothers $3,500 to orchestrate the attack.

'What about MAGA'

Trump, who said earlier in the investigation that the alleged attack was ""horrible,"" addressed Smollett directly in a tweet on Thursday saying: "".@JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA""

Cut from 'Empire'

As a result of the allegations against Smollett, his role on ""Empire,"" where he played Jamal Lyon, was cut from the final episodes of the fifth season ""to avoid further disruption on set,"" the show's executive producers said in a joint statement on Feb. 22.

Free on Bond

Smollett posted $10,000 of his $100,000 bond on Feb. 21, and a Chicago judge later ruled he would be allowed to travel.

'Tremendous regret'

A lawyer representing Ola and Abel Osundairo released a statement on Feb. 28 saying her clients ""have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.""

'More evidence'

Johnson said on March 1 that there was additional evidence in the case that hadn't been made public.

""As far as the evidence goes, we laid everything out in the bond proffer, the highlights of it, but there’s additional evidence out there that we haven’t released yet, but it’ll help support that the alleged incident didn’t occur the way that he claimed,"" Johnson said.

16 counts

Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for making a false report by a grand jury in Chicago on March 8.

All charges dropped

Chicago prosecutors abruptly dropped all of the charges against Smollett on March 26.

During a brief news conference after the announcement, Smollett said he has been ""truthful"" from the beginning. ""This has been an incredibly difficult time. Honestly, one of the worst of my life,"" he said.

Chicago Police Department commander Ed Wodnicki told NBC Chicago that the reversal of charges was a ""punch in the gut"" and prosecution did not discuss their decision with the police department prior to Tuesday's announcement.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Johnson railed against the decision to drop the charges.

""This is without a doubt, a whitewash of justice and sends a clear message that if you are in a position of influence and power you'll get treated one way, other people will be treated another way,"" Emanuel said.

Questioning the top prosecutor

Chicago police union, the Fraternal Order of Police, asked the Department of Justice to investigate Foxx’s role in the decision to not prosecute Smollett.

The union had accused Foxx on March 19 of interfering in the Smollett case before recusing herself after the Chicago Sun-Times that Tina Tchen, a Chicago lawyer and former chief of staff to first lady Michelle Obama, had put Foxx in touch with members of Jussie Smollet's family days after he told police he was the victim of a homophobic, racist attack.

There was no direct response from Foxx. Her spokeswoman, Tandra Simonton, insisted that the Smollett case was treated no differently from the more than 5,700 other “cases for alternative prosecution” that the office has handled in the past two years.

“We did not exonerate Mr. Smollett,” Simonton added. “The charges were dropped in return for Mr. Smollett’s agreement to do community service and forfeit his $10,000 bond to the City of Chicago. Without the completion of these terms, the charges would not have been dropped. This outcome was met under the same criteria that would occur for and is available to any defendant with similar circumstances.”"

On Monday, Bennett College, in Greensboro, N.C., will argue its case for maintaining its accreditation at a hearing before the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, or SACS.

Bennett has been on probation for two years due to financial instability — SACS does not offer a third year of probation, so Bennett's hearing will either result in its probation being lifted, or the loss of its accreditation. Revocation would cut off Bennett's access to federal funds, which would all but certainly close the school.

Representatives for Bennett plan to argue at the hearing that the school has secured the funds necessary to maintain its accreditation, its president, Phyllis Worthy Dawkins, told Michel Martin in an interview for NPR's All Things Considered.

In December, SACS voted to strip Bennett of its accreditation because the school failed to demonstrate ""sound financial resources"" and a ""stable financial base to support the mission of the institution and the scope of its programs and services."" Bennett appealed the decision.

""We were only called on one standard ... and that standard is on financial resources,"" Dawkins said. ""They did not question the quality of our academic programs, the credentials of our faculty and staff, or the leadership on our campus.""

In response to the SACS decision, Bennett launched a fundraising campaign aimed at raising $5 million. A #StandWithBennett campaign went viral on social media, thanks in part, Dawkins said, to support from celebrities like Jussie Smollett and his family. Donations soon began to pour in.

""[W]e've raised at least ... over $8.2 million that we announced on February 4th,"" Dawkins said. Since then, the total has risen to $8.7 million, she said.

Dawkins is depending on this appeal to overturn the agency's decision.

""We will win this appeal. We will remain accredited, as we are accredited right now,"" Dawkins explains.

But if their revocation is sustained, there is a contingency plan. Dawkins said the college is working to secure accreditation from a second body, the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools. The association is smaller than SACS, but is recognized by the Department of Education — meaning the college would still be eligible for federal funding.

Bennett College's financial woes aren't dissimilar to those faced by other historically black colleges and universities, which are notoriously underfunded. In December, Saint Augustine University, just 80 miles east in Raleigh, was removed from probation after demonstrating to SACS that it had addressed its financial concerns.

Bennett is now hoping for a similar successful outcome in order to preserve one of the nation's seminal institutions in educating black women. Dawkins understands this.

""Women's institutions, HBCUs, need to continue to thrive and survive into the future,"" she said.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

There are only two historically black women's colleges in the U.S. One of them, Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C., has been facing a loss of accreditation because of shaky finances, and that would lead to a loss of federal funding among other consequences. An appeals hearing before an accreditation board is scheduled for tomorrow. But, going into the hearing, Bennett has some good news to report. After launching a social media campaign at the beginning of this month, Bennett exceeded its goal and raised some $8.7 million. The president of Bennett, Phyllis Worthy Dawkins, told me how the fundraising took off.

PHYLLIS WORTHY DAWKINS: We came up with this slogan - stand with Bennett. And then we secured the Smollett family - Jussie, Jess (ph) and Jake - to wear our T-shirts and to post it on social media via Twitter, Instagram. And really, that really platformed us into national prominence. And so, to this end, we have had a number of supporters from faith-based groups, sororities and fraternities, corporations, foundations - even high school students, elementary kids, a variety of different people coming out to support Bennett College.

MARTIN: So this week, you're going to argue your case for accreditation to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. And, as we noted, that accreditation, you know, matters. I mean, without it, perhaps the student - the graduates' degrees will not be recognized by other institutions if they want to go on to graduate work - and not to mention the federal funding. So what is going to be your argument, if you don't mind giving us a bit of a preview?

DAWKINS: Right. The biggest argument is that we were only called on one standard out of 90 to 95 standard, and that standard is on financial resources or financial stability. We were not called on any other standards. They did not question the quality of our academic programs, the credentials of our faculty and staff or the leadership on our campus. We were only called on financial resources. And, according to the sanction, we can introduce new financial funds to support our appeal case on this Monday.

MARTIN: If you don't win this appeal, what's next?

DAWKINS: We will win the appeal - trying to stay very positive about that. We will win this appeal. But - and we will remain accredited, as we are accredited right now. But, at the same time, we are also seeking another accreditation called TRACS to ensure that we are accredited, whether we are accredited by SACS or by TRACS.

MARTIN: How would people know Bennett? I mean, if people are not familiar with the area, or perhaps they don't have kids who are headed to college or young women who are headed for college, how would they know Bennett? I mean, I know that certainly Greensboro is an historic area, plays a - certainly an important role in the civil rights movement. I mean, give us a sense of how people would know Bennett.

DAWKINS: Well, Bennet was a part of the civil rights movement. And Bennett students promote social justice, and they're also heavily engaged in civic activities. Bennett's history in terms of social justice dates back to 1937, when they protested the Carolina Theatre. And then Bennet was also known in 1958. We hosted Martin Luther King on our campus when other schools turned him away because of potential conflicts at that time. And then, in 1960, when the North Carolina freshman students sat in at the Woolworth's counter, Bennett women were behind the planning of that event.

And so Bennett's history is rich in social justice and civic engagement, located in Greensboro, N.C. And in North Carolina, there are 10 HBCUs, and Bennett is the first all-women's institution among the HBCUs - the other one being Spelman. So Bennett has a rich history of contributions to the Greensboro community and to the U.S.

MARTIN: That was Phyllis Worthy Dawkins, president of Bennett College.

President Dawkins, thank you so much for talking with us.

DAWKINS: And thank you.

MARTIN: Now, you just heard President Dawkins mention that the family of actor Jussie Smollett helped jumpstart Bennett College's fundraising campaign. A quick update on the other Jussie Smollett story in the news. Police have released without charge two men arrested in connection with an alleged attack against Smollett due to new evidence.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is Black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts.

Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may

“I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

“The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait,” DuVernay said.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

Smollett claimed to law enforcement he went to a local Chicago Subway eatery at 2 a.m., and he was physically assaulted by two men in ski masks who poured a bleach-like substance on him and tied a rope around his neck like a noose. (RELATED: Here Are All The Politicians Who Rushed To Judgement On The Smollett ‘Hate Crime’)

Smollett, who is gay and black, also told police his attackers yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him as well as told him, “This is MAGA country.”

Politicians and celebrities alike rallied around Smollett, including Pelosi, who tweeted on January 29, “The racist, homophobic attack on [Smollett] is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love.”

However, as the case unfolded over the past two weeks more questions arose as to whether Smollett was telling the complete truth about the January 29 incident.

Others have yet to retract their original statements or delete their original tweets, including California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Democratic Sen. Corey Booker. Both are running for the Democratic nomination for president.

Booker was asked about the recent developments in the case and would only say he is waiting for more information before he makes any further statements about the matter. (RELATED: Cory Booker Called Smollett ‘Attack’ A ‘Lynching,’ Now He’s Refusing Comment Amid New Evidence In The Case)

According to ABC News, two Nigerian brothers, initially arrested by Chicago Police in connection to the assault against Smollett were later released after telling law enforcement that Smollett paid them to stage the attack.

One of the brothers is Smollett’s personal trainer, according to a statement to ABC News from Smollett’s attorneys. They had decided to cooperate after investigators revealed that they had evidence the brothers had bought the rope that was put around Smollet’s neck at a local hardware store.

Smollett’s attorneys released a statement denying he staged his own attack, saying in part, “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

I’m sure you know the general background, but just in case: Jussie Smollett claimed he was bum-rushed by two masked men shouting anti-gay and racial slurs, claiming, “This is MAGA country!”

Many on the Left — as is their wont — immediately believed Jussie and proclaimed the horrific assault the end of anecdotal irrelevance: “From now on, this one situation proves all other situations! #EvilGOPSuxx”

There. A recap.

But now, an interesting turn.

As stated by Fox News:

A Chicago police spokesperson on Saturday said Empire actor Jussie Smollett is no longer considered a victim in the case…

Police earlier said that the “trajectory of the investigation” shifted and that they wanted to conduct another interview with Smollett about the alleged hate crime last month. Police released two Nigerian brothers who were held for questioning about the reported attack. They were released late Friday without charges. “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the “Empire” case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Courtesy of USA Today:

Two brothers told Chicago police investigators that they were paid by Empire actor Jussie Smollett to stage an attack on him, according to a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly.

Some followers of the story had smelled fish from the beginning, and Trump Jr. was apparently sniffing his share of snapper.

Hence, a tweet dropping the bomb on Jussie over a MAGA-menace hoax:

Shocked, I really thought MAGA folks (who are all over downtown Chicago) were waiting with a rope/bottle of bleach to ambush a righ guy at 2am in minus 4 degrees because those are conditions where all people go out for Subway rather than order Seamless.

On October 25, 1994, a frantic young South Carolina mother named Susan Smith told police that her car had been carjacked by a black man who drove away with her two boys, aged three years old and 14 months. For nine days, with a nationwide search underway, she made tearful pleas on television for their safe return. “I wanna say to my babies,” she sobbed with her distraught husband by her side, “your mama loves you so much.” Finally her story unraveled and she confessed to intentionally sending her Mazda into a nearby lake with her two young sons strapped inside.

Apart from the unconscionable drowning of her own helpless children, Susan Smith’s story contained a racial dimension that tore at the nation’s social fabric: her false accusation that a black man had victimized a young white mother and murdered her innocent babies. It was an ugly but shrewd lie that exploited bigotry for sympathy in order to conceal her own evil.

On January 29, 2019, Jussie Smollett, a 36-year-old, gay black actor on the Fox drama series Empire, told police he had been assaulted outside his apartment building at 2 a.m. on a snowy Chicago night by two men in ski masks who identified him as the Empire actor, hurled racial and anti-gay slurs at him, draped a makeshift noose around his neck, and tossed some bleach on him before disappearing. TMZ reported that sources claimed the attackers had boasted to Smollett, “This is MAGA country”; he confirmed this in a follow-up interview with the police.

The story instantly made big news, but anyone not consumed by hatred for President Trump and his supporters immediately suspected a hoax because Smollett’s narrative lacked any credibility whatsoever. A pair of Trump supporters were walking the icy streets of Chicago at 2 a.m. with a noose and bleach (which inexplicably did not freeze in the literally sub-zero weather) when they recognized a little-known (to anyone but Empire fans) actor from a TV show no white supremacist would watch, assaulted him without causing any more physical damage than a scratch on his cheek but managed to get a noose around his neck, and then made sure to announce that “This is MAGA country”? Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s Chicago is “Make America Great Again” country? Who knew?

But Democrat politicians and celebrities predictably leapt to Smollett’s defense and denounced the Trump-inspired white supremacism that clearly was the culprit. Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both 2020 presidential hopefuls who have taken the art of grandstanding to a stratospheric level, described the attack as a modern-day lynching. Booker wasted no time pushing Congress to pass the federal Anti-Lynching Bill he and Harris co-sponsored (because apparently our porous border isn’t a national emergency, but lynching is). Rep. Maxine Waters took a quick break from chanting “Impeach Trump!” to blame him for “emboldening” racists. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the incident undeniably a racist, homophobic attack that reflected “what is happening to our country.” Her Congressional colleague Rashida Tlaib tweeted hyperbolically that “the lies of the right wing is [sic] killing and hurting our people.” Yet another 2020 Democrat hopeful, Joe Biden, pontificated that “racism and homophobia have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, another noted pontificator, called the attack an “affront to our humanity.”*

The Progressive media, also predictably, rushed to judgment as well because that’s what they do when they see an opportunity to demonize Trump and/or his supporters (recall the hysterics over the Covington Catholic high school students?). ABC’s Good Morning America granted Smollett the kind of lengthy sit-down interview usually reserved for presidents (more on that below). Joshua Rivera at GQ, ostensibly a men’s style magazine but actually a leftist propaganda rag, race-baited that “Whiteness in 21st century America has an endgame,” and that Smollett’s attack proved “racist homophobes [are] stalking the streets of your city, who want you to know that they could lynch you if they really wanted to, and maybe get away with it too.” Kevin Fallon, a senior entertainment reporter for the Daily Beast, tweeted, “People in MAGA hats recognized and then beat and poured bleach on Jussie Smollett, calling him that ‘faggot’ from Empire. Anyone who thinks supporting You Know Who isn’t tantamount to providing artillery for weaponized bigotry needs to take a hard look in the mirror.” In light of new developments, it looks like Fallon is the one who needs to take a hard look in the mirror – but he won’t. Neither will Rivera or ABC or anyone else who wasted no time slamming white conservatives.

Hollywood leftists, of course, had to chime in because they’re all virtue-signaling posturers who live in walled estates and travel with armed bodyguards. Jussie’s co-star Grace Byers wrote that “hatred, inequality, racism and discrimination continue to course through our country's veins.” Actor Nico Tortorella said the “red hat is the white hood. No ifs ands or buts. If you wear it, you attacked Jussie.” Another purported entertainer who is light-years away from being a household name, Billy Eichner, tweeted, “I want Trump and all MAGA lunatics to burn in Hell.” The insufferable, anti-Christian bigot/actress Ellen Page declared tearfully on Stephen Colbert’s late night talk show that Vice President Mike Pence was somehow to blame. And on and on. Too many celebrities-in-their-own-minds to count.

Smollett, who is also a singer, put on a show at the Troubadour in Los Angeles only a few nights after the incident, where he greeted the crowd by saying he felt compelled to perform because he refused to “let the m*th*rf*ck*ers win.” So brave. The crowd roared in support.

He went on to participate in a (seemingly) emotional Good Morning America interview with Robin Roberts, who asked why he thought he was targeted. Smollett replied, “I come really, really hard against 45 [President Trump]. I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.” Except when it comes to telling the truth, apparently. He also expressed frustration at not being believed. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” he told Roberts. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Actually, what says a lot about the country right now is that the leftist media uncritically accepts and disseminates reports of hate crimes that time and again prove to be hoaxes perpetrated to stoke racial hatred of white conservatives. When exposed, the hoaxers are rarely taken to task, and the media simply moves on to the next fake incident that supports The Narrative. It says a lot about the country right now that long before the Smollett investigation was complete, and on the basis of a story that had less credibility than what I tell my kids about the tooth fairy, a professed Trump-hater can get an interview on network television, rally the national support of celebrities and power-mad leftist politicos, and become the face of identity politics resistance to “hate.”

No Trump supporters victimized by leftist Antifa thugs – truly victimized, with actual evidence such as video footage captured in broad daylight – have ever secured an interview with Robin Roberts on GMA and been asked why they believe they were targeted. (Yes, Nicholas Sandmann, the teenager at the center of the Covington controversy, was interviewed on Today by Savannah Guthrie, but the interview’s angle was that Sandmann was guilty. “Do you feel from this experience that you owe anybody an apology?” Guthrie prodded. “Do you see your own fault in any way?” This would never be asked of someone from one of the left’s Official Victim Categories.)

Police had initially found a grainy surveillance camera image of two persons of interest but no footage of Smollett being attacked. Neither he nor his manager would allow authorities to examine their phones – potentially a critical source of evidence because the two were reportedly in mid-conversation with each other when the attack occurred. The manager said he actually heard the attack, including the phrase “MAGA country” and a racial slur. Eventually Smollett turned over phone records too heavily redacted to be of any assistance in the investigation.

Then Smollett’s story began to unravel. On February 13, police raided the home of the two persons of interest in the surveillance photo. Turns out they weren’t white Trumpsters who get their kicks from sub-zero lynchings, but Nigerian bodybuilders and brothers who just coincidentally happen to know Smollett. They have even acted as extras on Empire. Police found bleach in the residence and evidence that the rope found around Smollett’s neck was purchased at a nearby hardware store. The two men had left the country for Nigeria the day after the incident and were arrested after arriving on a return flight February 13. Sources say that the two are cooperating fully with police and admitted to being paid $3,500 by Smollett to stage the attack before leaving for Nigeria and promised an additional $500 upon their return. As for Smollett, he has hired a criminal defense attorney team.

The whole story has yet to be pieced together. As of this writing, Smollett has neither confessed nor been found guilty of anything. Indeed, he claimed through an attorneys’ statement that he is “angered” and “devastated” by insinuations that he orchestrated the incident. If further investigation confirms that the actor was indeed assaulted by two white, racist Trump supporters, then I will do what practically no one in the mainstream media or the entertainment industry who accepted his story unquestioningly is doing now: publicly apologize. But at this moment, everything points to Smollett having concocted a hate crime, weaponized it in service to the left’s hateful ideology, and milked it for nationwide sympathy and possibly a career boost (a rumor has circulated that Smollett was about to be written off his show).

How will all those who rushed to condemn white people, Trump supporters, Mike Pence, America in general, etc. respond if and when Jussie Smollett proves to have staged the attack? Good Morning America and the rest of the mainstream media won’t follow up with an apology. Neither will any of the Democrat politicians who exploited it. Neither will any of the holier-than-thou moral paragons in the cesspool of decadence that is Hollywood. They will find a way to spin the narrative. They will claim that being morally right supersedes being factually correct (as if the two are not inextricably linked), and say that Smollett sparked a conversation that we need to have in this country about our corrosive legacy of slavery, about the rising white cisgender supremacism in the country, blah blah blah. They will not take responsibility, much less question their own ideological fundamentalism.

Unlike Susan Smith, Jussie Smollett didn’t commit a monstrous crime. But like Susan Smith’s lie, Jussie Smollett’s ratcheted up racial tensions in America and drove the wedge deeper between the political left and right. In addition to wasting police resources that could have gone toward legitimate criminal investigations in crime-rotten Chicago, Smollett has betrayed the minority communities that he supposedly championed. He has made things more difficult for actual victims of bigotry. And he has fueled the ongoing demonization of white conservatives in America as the fount of all racism, oppression, and hatred. That’s the real hate crime here.

But this isn’t all on Smollett; Hollywood, the news media, and Democrat Party bigwigs were all complicit. They weren’t taken in by him, because to them it was irrelevant whether his claims were true or not. All that mattered, and all that will matter to them henceforth, was to keep on the offensive, to keep up the pressure on evil President Trump and white America.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed on Saturday that following the arrest and release of two brothers who were taken into custody as persons of interest, the “case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” Police are requesting a followup interview with the Empire star, 36.

The authorities now believe Smollett paid the two men to orchestrate the assault, according to CNN.

Following the claims that he staged his attack, Smollett’s attorney released a statement to ABC 7 Chicago. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement read in part. “One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

The men arrested in the case were released from police custody on Friday, February 15. “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Guglielmi said via a statement on Twitter.

Earlier that day, the Chicago Police Department confirmed to Us Weekly that two men had been arrested in the case. Hours later, Guglielmi told the Associated Press that the alleged criminals were “persons of interest” and were brought in to police custody because of “probable cause that they may have committed a crime.”

After ABC 7 Chicago called the incident a “hoax” on Thursday, February 14, Guglielmi told Us that Smollett is being “treated by police as a victim, not a suspect” and that there is “no evidence” that proves the attack was staged.

The Mighty Ducks alum was hospitalized on January 29 after he was allegedly attacked in the early morning hours by men who screamed “racial and homophobic slurs” at him while he was out getting food from a local Subway sandwich shop.

Smollett spoke out in an emotional Good Morning America interview with Robin Roberts on Thursday. “They called me a f—-t, they called me a n–ga. There’s no which way you cut it,” he said of his attackers. “I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative.

Sara Burnett And Greg McCune, The Associated Press





Chicago police said Sunday they're still seeking a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett after receiving new information that ""shifted"" their investigation of a reported attack on the ""Empire"" actor.

The trajectory of the investigation ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett's attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue co-operating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

This has to be like a slow drip drip drip torture for Jussie Smollet with all these reports leaking out about what is coming next for him.

As I wrote here yesterday BREAKING: Actor Jussie Smollett LIED About Racial Attack. and the news keep leaking out slowly, all bad for him since.

According to Page Six a Grand jury is now going to be involved.

The Jussie Smollett case will go before a grand jury early next week, according to a new report. Law enforcement sources tell TMZ that a panel will hear the case, but the outlet didn’t elaborate on who is facing charges — or what they might be. The “Empire” star told cops he was assaulted in Chicago on Jan. 29 by two men spewing racist and homophobic slurs at him — but his story has since come under fire as sources have alleged to news outlets that he actually paid some pals to stage the whole thing.

The police have released the two brothers picked up on Wednesday that were allegdly involved in the attack. Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo are said to be cooperating with police and have not been charged with anything.

Smollet through his attorney had this to say…

“One of the brothers was his personal trainer, and the star finds it “impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

If this Jussie guy is lying, he is really good at the acting thing.

This is a total who know what and if it is found that Smollet actually did this, part of his rehabilitation should be to explain to this country why he would do something like this. When you are a famous actor singer and pull a stunt like this to inflame racial tensions it is inexplicable.

Maybe someone could explain it to me but I might need a half bottle of a really good Bourbon to help with the reasoning.

Share Tweet By: AFP

CHICAGO (AFP) – An investigation into an alleged attack on an openly gay black actor has “shifted” and police are now seeking a follow-up interview with the “Empire” cast member, a spokesman said Sunday.

Jussie Smollett, 36, reported to police on January 29 that two men beat him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck while he walked downtown in the third-largest American city.

The announced change in direction came two days after police said that the two “potential suspects” in the attack had been released without charge and as US media outlets reported that the attack may have been staged.

“The information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

“We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” he added.

Multiple US media outlets reported the two men are brothers who were arrested at Chicago’s O’Hare airport upon their return from a trip to Nigeria.

At least one of the men reportedly worked on “Empire,” a TV series about the fortunes of a hip-hop mogul and his family battling over control of a multi-million-dollar music company.

In an emotional interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” broadcast Thursday, Smollett gave details of the purported attack and said he was angry at doubts about its veracity.

Smollett said a masked man yelled “Empire” as the actor was walking through an intersection after a late-night stop at a sandwich shop.

After he ignored the man, Smollett said the attacker yelled out a racial slur and used President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan acronym “MAGA,” which stands for “Make America Great Again.”

Smollett said the man called Chicago “MAGA country” and then punched him in the face, at which point the actor fought with the attacker, and was kicked by a second man he had not noticed earlier.

“It felt like minutes, but it was probably like 30 seconds, honestly,” Smollett said.

Initial reports of the attack shocked the entertainment industry and brought waves of support from advocacy groups and senior politicians, including Democratic presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand.

The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the Empire star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in U.S. President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had “shifted” — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again. Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police “are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

“And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,” Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push “the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

The NYPD said Sunday it was reviewing allegations by 50 Cent that a police officer told other cops to shoot the rapper and actor on sight.

The Grammy-winner, whose given name is Curtis Jackson, tweeted that he took the threat seriously and was consulting his lawyer. Jackson called Deputy Inspector Emanuel Gonzalez a ""dirty cop abusing his POWER.""

The NYPD told NBC 4 New York that the incident was under internal review.

The allegations stem from a report in The Daily News that Gonzalez told officers at a roll call last summer to ""shoot him on sight,"" referring to Jackson's expected appearance at an NYPD boxing match. The report was based on an anonymous source.

Gonzalez and Jackson apparently had an ongoing feud involving one of Jackson's favorite bars in Sunset Park, The Daily News reported. Jackson accused Gonzalez of shaking down the bar in a since-deleted Instagram post. Gonzalez filed an aggravated harassment complaint accusing Jackson of threatening him in a comment on that post. No charges were filed.

Now there are rumors saying something unbelievable.

According to Associated Press, Chicago police said that their investigation has “shifted” because of new information they have received. Meanwhile, Jussie’s attorneys released a statement that he is “angered and devastated by recent reports,” following the rumors that he orchestrated the said attack.

Two Nigerian brothers, Olbaninjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, were arrested by the police, they were questioned then released without charges. One of them was apparently, Jussie’s trainer and the other was an extra on Empire.

“We can confirm the information received from the individuals’ questions by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” said Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi to Associated Press. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

There are a number of unnamed sources that were released, like CBS Evening News, that say that the attack was staged. Jussie allegedly paid the two brothers and had them buy the rope found around his neck.

Jussie responded through a statement released by his attorneys: “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” it said. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement further said. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate,” Jussie’s attorneys added.

Spokesman Anthony continued to push back the reports that the crime was a hoax, he tweeted that these rumors are unconfirmed.

Media reports anout the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.

All these prove just how hard it is to fight and report about hate crime.

Reporter Elana Schor of the Associated Press caught Cory Booker in Washington, D.C., Sunday morning, and asked the presidential hopeful if he had further thoughts on Smollett’s case, after calling the incident a “modern day lynching” mere hours after Smollett claimed to have been attacked by two assailants yelling racist and anti-gay slurs.

“The information is still coming out. I’m going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources,” Booker said.

This is a far cry from how Booker treated the case immediately after news of the incident originally came to light.

Smollett reported being accosted in downtown Chicago by two unknown men dressed in black on the morning of January 29. In his initial police report, Smollett claimed the two men were waiting for him outside of his apartment building when he returned from purchasing a sandwich from a Subway shop three blocks away. The two men allegedly knocked Smollett to the ground, poured an “unknown liquid” on him, believed by Smollett to be bleach, and tossed a rope around Smollett’s neck.

TMZ reported the incident as a “hate crime” later that morning.

Although local Chicago reporters were already pointing out potential holes in Smollett’s story, Booker expressed his unqualified support for the “Empire” actor, calling the attack a “modern-day lynching” in a tweet and encouraging his colleagues in Congress to support his anti-lynching legislation.

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe,” Booker tweeted. “To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention.”

This past Saturday, sources within the Chicago Police Department revealed to CNN, among other mainstream outlets, that Smollett was no longer being considered a “victim” in the incident, and that Smollett may have orchestrated the attack himself.

Media networks also reported that two Nigerian men arrested in connection with the incident had indicated to police that Smollett paid them $4,000 each to help him stage the attack, and substantiated their claims with receipts listing their purchase of rope and two “plain red hats.”

On Sunday, the Chicago Police Department pleaded with Smollett to submit to additional interviews with detectives on the case: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told media Sunday afternoon, adding, “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Chicago police say they still want to do a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett about a reported attack that the ""Empire"" star says included his attackers yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday the investigation had ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges.

Guglielmi said Sunday police have told Smollett's attorneys they want to do a follow-up interview with the actor. He said he couldn't comment on reports that police believe the actor staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case.

A spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers said Sunday she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett's lawyers said Saturday the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports he played a role in the assault. They also said Smollett would continue co-operating with police.

Chicago police and representatives for Jussie Smollett aren't speaking publicly about the investigation into a reported attack on the ""Empire"" actor.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said police had reached out to Smollett's attorney to request a follow-up interview with him.

Pam Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett reported last month that he was attacked by men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs.

Ingraham didn’t stop with Smollett, though — she also named Kavanaugh accusers Julie Swetnick and Christine Blasey-Ford, suggesting that they should also be subject to prosecution. (RELATED: ‘Reliable Sources Guest Blamed Celebs For Stirring Up Smollett Story — Stephen Miller Has Receipts)

While some argued from the very beginning that the pieces in the Smollett case didn’t quite add up, official reports only began emerging on Saturday that police were investigating the “Empire” actor for his possible role in staging the attack himself.

Meanwhile, multiple politicians and celebrities seized on the narrative as Smollett told it. Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker even referred to the alleged incident as a “modern-day lynching” — an assessment he has not qualified in light of new evidence suggesting it was nothing of the sort.

Jussie Smollett’s lawyers have come out to state that the Empire actor does not know anything about paying 2 Nigerian brothers for his attack in January.

Reports spread recently that the two Nigerian brothers, Abimbola Abel and Olabinjo Ola Osundairo received cash from Smollett to play out the attack.

The brothers were apprehended on February 13, 2019, in connection to the case.

His lawyers said, “Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,”

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”"

In the latest unexpected development to emanate from what had originally appeared to be a simple (albeit horrific) case of assault against the star, Smollett has released a statement through his legal team.

It seeks to end speculation that Smollett actually staged the attack late last month in which he was allegedly beaten and taunted by a pair of racist assailants.

This is what Smollett's attorney said late Saturday on his client's behalf:

As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

How did we possibly get to this point?

It's a long and convoluted story...

Smollett told Chicago police that he was savagely beaten early on the morning of January 29.

He told authorities back then that the two suspects screamed yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" that they tied a rope around his neck, that they poured bleach all over him and that he eventually took himself to a hospital for treatment.

The case made national headlines.

Numerous 2020 Presidential candidates sent their thoughts to Smollett, celebrities everywhere showered him with support and Donald Trump told the press it was a ""horrible"" incident.

The beating was referring to in the press as a ""hate crime"" and a ""modern-day lynching.""

Shortly after this story went viral, however, the police and the media were given reason to have some doubts.

Smollett, for example, reportedly refused to turn over his full cell phone records to the cops.

According to a new TMZ article, the police were also suspicious after Smollett took them to the scene of the alleged crime and immediately pointed out an obscure security camera in the vicinity.

Questions were raised internally over how Smollett know about this camera and whether he actually planned the attack to occur within the sight of it.

Then... two arrests were made in the case.

However, the men arrested were brothers from Nicaragua who actually worked in the past as extras on Empire. They knew Smollett somewhat well.

This raised even more questions, along the lines of:

Would two African-Americans really scream racial epithets at Smollett?

Might Smollett have paid these associates off as part of an elaborate hoax?

This theory is now gaining quite a bit of momentum.

For starters, the brothers were released without being charged -- and the reason given by Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi certainly raises a bunch of eyebrows:

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

Shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

The latest update from CNN also begins as follows:

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation tell CNN that Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month...

Multiple outlets claim that Smollett paid the siblings $4,000 in exchange for their role in the assault.

Why would he do this?

Presumably, sources have alleged, because he was being written off Empire and thought producers would change their minds after he became such a sympathetic figure on the national stage.

It's worth noting, however, that all executives and writers associated with Empire have strongly denied having any plans to let Smollett go.

As you can see, this is a confusing and disturbing case all around.

Either Smollett really was the victim of a violent hate crime... or he's lying about it. There's no in between at this point.

Speaking to Robin Roberts of Good Morning America last Thursday, Smollett insisted he was telling the truth.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" Smollett said.

""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now."""

I think I can speak for many in that I will be genuinely pissed off royally if Smollet did this for attention or to keep his job on “Empire.”

I’ve remained silent on this, but as it continues playing out like a bad film, I’ve started checking on some things that have been whispered about. It was only days after the attack that things were beginning to feel like the tide was slowly turning against the actor. Whispers began that he was being written off “Empire,” and this type of event would raise his profile so the producers would want to keep him for a ratings bump.

FOX Entertainment and 20th Century FOX Television, which produces the Chicago-based family drama, pushed back against the notion that Smollett was being written off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” the statement said.

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation tell media outlets that Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month.

Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi has changed his comments today when asked by MTTG if investigators still believe that Smollett was the victim of an attack. He stopped just shy of categorizing how investigators were currently viewing the actor.

“We have some new information that we would like to corroborate,” he said.

Smollett denies playing a role in his attack, according to a statement from his attorneys.

The men, who are brothers, were arrested Wednesday but released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of “new evidence.”

The sources told media outlets the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

The sources told media outlets there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at a hardware store in Chicago.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement to media outlets Saturday night saying Smollett was angry about these latest developments.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s attorneys said they expect further updates from Chicago police on the investigation and will continue cooperating with authorities.

“At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels,” the statement read.

Smollett identifies as gay and since 2015 has played the gay character of Jamal on the Fox TV drama “Empire.”

How This All Began

According to Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, the actor told detectives he was attacked by two men near the lower entrance of a Loews hotel in Chicago. Police were told the two men yelled “‘Empire’ fa***t” and “‘Empire’ n***er'” while striking him.

In a supplemental interview with authorities, Smollett confirmed media reports that one of the attackers also shouted, “This is MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump‘s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

The day after the incident, police released surveillance images that showed two silhouetted individuals walking down a sidewalk, and police said they were wanted for questioning.

The two men were arrested Wednesday. Police on Friday said the men were being viewed as “potential suspects” and that detectives had “probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.”

But by Friday night they had been released, Guglielmi said, “due to new evidence as a result of today’s investigations.”

“And detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” he added.

One of the men has appeared on “Empire,” Guglielmi said. A police source also told MEDIA OUTLETS on Friday night that the men had a previous affiliation with Smollett, but did not provide additional details.

Jussie Smollet Has Held Claim This Wasn’t A Hoax

Following the alleged attack, Smollett’s colleagues and fans rallied around him, expressing shock and sadness.

“We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows that we are united on a united front,” Lee Daniels, the creator of “Empire,” said in a video posted to his Instagram page on January 29. “And no racist f*** can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up, Jussie. I’m with you.”

Smollett gave his first detailed account of what he says was a hate crime against him, and the aftermath, in an interview with ABC‘s “Good Morning America” that aired Thursday.

During the interview he expressed frustration at not being believed.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Smollett stated that one of the attackers shouted “this is MAGA country” before punching him in the face. But he refuted reports that said he told police the attackers wore “Make America Great Again” hats.

“I never said that,” he told ABC’s Robin Roberts. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t , they called me a n****r . There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story. — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 17, 2019

Naturally, Donald Trump’s family has used this opportunity to sound off and Jr. has shot off a few tweets about Smollett.

If this is a hoax, I honestly hope that Jussie pays for it as these types of things affect people who are truly victims of hate crimes. We’ll see how things play out, but Smollett will have set things back for real victims of racism, homophobia and hate crimes if this was all a stunt to feed his need for attention."

A grand jury will reportedly hear the Jussie Smollett case sometime early this week, according to a report out this afternoon on TMZ.

Law enforcement sources close to the investigation have revealed that the two Nigerian brothers previously detained as suspects in the case are “under the watchful eye of police so no one gets to them” ahead of the grand jury investigation.

Related: Police Want To Question Jussie Again

Cops apparently “especially want to make sure” that Jussie does not have any contact with either of the brothers.

According to sources related to this investigation, Jussie was asked early on if he’d sign complaints against the two men who attacked him — and when he found out that the two brothers (who he knew) were the ones in custody, he “said he knew them, felt bad for them, and declined to sign the complaints.”

Hmmm…

It’s a tricky scenario, and the grand jury may shed more light on it this coming week.

Of course, prosecutors can use grand juries in many different good and not-so-good ways, so we may not see a resolution in the case for quite some time…

The announcement came after investigators released two men – brothers who know Smollett – without charging them after having identified them as potential suspects Friday. At least one of them had appeared on Empire and Smollett, through his lawyers, has acknowledged hiring one of the men as a personal trainer.

Several news outlets, including CNN, reported that law enforcement sources said the brothers had told investigators they were paid to take part in a hoax. On Sunday, Anthony Guglielmi, chief spokesman for the Chicago Police Department, reported the lattest official developments in a Twitter post.

On Friday, Smollet’s lawyers issued a strong statement in which the actor rejected any suggestion that he had any role in staging an assault on himself. The episode has been in the national spotlight for weeks, and even President Donald Trump has weighed in on it.

As of Sunday, police said they were interested in interviewing Smollett again as they sort out what occurred.

Ttimeline: how we got here

Jan. 29: Smollett, who is black and openly gay, tells police that at about 2am local time, two masked men he believed to be white attacked him on the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street in Downtown Chicago. The assailants, according to Smollett, hurled homophobic and racial slurs at him, put a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him.

Smollett says he went home and a close associate of his reported the incident to police 40 minutes after it happened. Guglielmi later told The Chicago Sun-Times that Smollett had been hesitant to call the police because of his status as a public figure.

Law enforcement officials say they are treating the incident “as a possible hate crime”. At a follow-up visit by investigators, Smollett says the attackers mentioned “MAGA country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Several A-list celebrities, politicians, and advocacy groups offer their support to Smollett. Fox, the network on which Empire airs, issues a statement saying the “entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate”.

Detectives comb through surveillance camera recordings but say they can’t find images of the attack.

Jan 30: Investigators announce the first tangible progress in the case: a surveillance image shows “potential persons of interest wanted for questioning” in connection to the case. The images are of two men with their backs to the camera. At this point, the FBI is investigating a threatening letter sent to Smollett at the Empire production offices in Chicago the week before.

Jan 31: President Trump is asked about the incident. He refers to it as “horrible” and added that it “doesn’t get worse” . The Smollett family releases a statement: “Jussie was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

Feb 1: Smollett releases his first public statement through his publicist. It says: “Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Acknowledging some scepticism about his story on social media, Smollett adds, “I am working with authorities and have been 100 per cent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

The Chicago police superintendent, Eddie T. Johnson, says in an interview with a local television station: “We have to remember, he’s a victim. You know, so we have to treat it like he’s a victim. We have no reason to think that he’s not being genuine with us.”

Feb 3: Smollett appears in public for the first time since he reported the attack, performing a concert in West Hollywood. “I have so many words on my heart that I want to say, but the most important thing I can say is, thank you so much, and that I’m OK,” Smollett tells the crowd.

Feb 4: Chicago police say the people of interest have not been identified yet but they are continuing to follow up on leads.

Feb 11: The department reacts to phone records that Smollett turned over to investigators. Police had asked Smollett for access to his phone because he had been in conversation with his manager when the incident occurred. Smollett provides the police with redacted records that they say “do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation”.

Feb 13: Two brothers of Nigerian descent, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, are detained by authorities after landing in Chicago on a flight from Nigeria. Police raid their home and, according to CBS Chicago, remove items including an Empire script and two hats.

Feb 14: Smollett gives his first interview about the incident to Good Morning America, where he is adamant that he is telling the truth. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,” Smollett tells ABC’s Robin Roberts. “A lot more.” He also says he is convinced that the men in the surveillance images were his attackers. “Because I was there,” Smollett says. “For me, when that was released, I was like, ‘OK, we’re getting somewhere.’ I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.” Chicago police reveal publicly that at least one of the men detained has appeared as an extra on Empire. The department also says they “are not yet suspects”. Their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, tells CBS Chicago, “They’re really baffled why they are people of interest. They really don’t understand how they even got information that linked them to this horrific crime. But they’re not guilty of it. They know that the evidence is going to prove them innocent. They send their best to Jussie.”

The local news media releases its first reports that investigators are beginning to look at the possibility that this is a hoax, something Chicago police dispute publicly.

Feb 15: In a whirlwind day, the detained brothers are identified as potential suspects by police, but that night are released without being charged. Investigators announce they are no longer considered suspects but do not say why.

Feb 16: Police say they are seeking to speak with Smollett again. Media outlets, including CNN, report that the two men have told investigators they were paid to take part in a hoax. Guglielmi says in a statement, “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Lawyers for Smollett release a statement saying, “As a victim of a hate crime who has co-operated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.”

It added: “One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

The lawyers say that Smollett will “continue to co-operate” and that they “have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation.” – New York Times"

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had “shifted” — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police “are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to co-operate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

“And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,” Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push “the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.”

The response from Smollett’s celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn’t know what to say, but that the situation is a “mess” and a “travesty.”

“I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

“The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait,” DuVernay said.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

“I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,” Gay wrote. “Because more often than not they are telling the truth.”"

Here’s 12 establishment media commentators and journalists who fueled the Jussie Smollett flames with impassioned and uncritical reactions to the Empire actor’s imaginative account of his supposed run-in with Trump supporters in “MAGA country” Chicago.

1. Eugene Scott – Washington Post‘s The Fix reporter

“To many, the Smollett incident — and the political nature of the assault — is yet another reminder for many black gay Americans that this president’s vision of a ‘great America’ does not appear to include them,” wrote Eugene Scott for Washington Post‘s The Fix.

2. Don Lemon – CNN journalist

CNN’s Don Lemon told Red Table Talk that he wasn’t shocked when he heard Smollett’s story, adding that he was concerned about the actor’s “well-being” in having to deal with being black, gay, and famous.

“One, he has to deal with discrimination as a black man,” said Lemon, “then, on top of that, he has to be gay — and then, fame — fame is not natural — When something happens to you and it’s controversial, everyone is coming for you, and so I knew everyone would be picking apart his story.”

3. Yamiche Alcindor – PBS NewsHour White House correspondent

“We have to do better as a country. This is disgusting,” said PBS NewsHour White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, in a tweet referring to the alleged attackers shouting “This is MAGA country,” which was then retweeted by CNN commentator Sally Kohn.

4. Joyce Vance – MSNBC contributor

“If someone commits this kind of act under your banner, you should have the decency to publicly condemn them and say it’s not what you stand for. But I doubt Trump will,” tweeted MSNBC contributor Joyce Vance in response to Alcindor.

5. Jamil Smith – Rolling Stone journalist

“The brutal attack on him in Chicago appears to be yet another example not just of further moral decay, but of the brand of terrorism that still doesn’t seem to spark enough response by Americans,” tweeted Rolling Stone journalist Jamil Smith.

6. April Ryan – CNN analyst

“This attack on @JussieSmollett is a hate crime and should be treated as such!” affirmed CNN’s April Ryan, in response to the NAACP’s Derrick Johnson, who claimed the actor had been a victim of a “racist, homophobic attack” and that “divisive, hateful rhetoric” is putting “lives at risk.”

7. Jemele Hill – The Atlantic journalist

“I’ve met @JussieSmollett a few times at social events and he emanates warmth and joy. I’m just disgusted and appalled that he has suffered the unimaginable,” tweeted an uncritical Jemele Hill.

“The media is broken. If they can’t call the attack on Jussie racist straight up then they need to find alternative employment,” argued the MSNBC analyst, scrutinizing any media that had been referring to the incident as an “apparent hate crime.”

“Apparent HATE CRIME?” continued Maxwell, “Sure bc that has a legal definition. But to be clear pouring bleach on a Black person while you are yelling about MAGA = RACIST”

9. Joy Reid – MSNBC correspondent

“Nooses never really disappeared as messages of a very specific kind of terror,” said MSNBC’s Joy Reid, “but every time they’re used, my God, it’s chilling. Praying for Jussie’s full recovery. And for us all.”

10. Karen Attiah – Washington Post editor

“Regarding the heinous attack on @JussieSmollett, yet another reminder that Trump’s ascendance and the resulting climate of hate has meant that lives have been increasingly at stake since 2015. Smollett could have been killed by those thugs screaming MAGA. Let that sink in,” tweeted Washington Post editor Karen Attiah.

11. Amy Siskind – Huffington Post contributor

“Can we get anyone in the Trump orbit to condemn the 2 MAGA men who brutally attacked Jussie Smollett, a gay black man, and put his head in a noose while saying ‘This is MAGA country,’ so others don’t feel like your silence is legitimizing hate? How about you @realDonaldTrump?” tweeted Huffington Post contributor Amy Siskind.

“Confirmed. Trump needs to address this attack publicly and condemn it!” continued Siskind in another tweet, which included a Huffington Post article that did not confirm anything, other than the fact that Smollett had spoken to the police.

“Absolutely despicable,” said CNN’s Brooke Baldwin on CNN Newsroom, “and this is America in 2019.”

By Lindsey Bahr / Associated Press

LOS ANGELES — The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had “shifted” — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police “are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

“And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,” Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push “the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.”

The response from Smollett’s celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn’t know what to say, but that the situation is a “mess” and a “travesty.”

“I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

“The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait,” DuVernay said.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

“I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,” Gay wrote. “Because more often than not they are telling the truth.”

In essence, that’s what it has always meant to be black in America: shining through the shit even as it swirls, daring to be boldly yourself against individual and structural contempt. Black History Month is always an interesting study in that reality—a chance to most proudly display all that we are, and a reminder that we remain who we are in spite of it all. With the current presidential administration and cultural climate, it’s been especially significant to see black folks loving on themselves. And lately, it feels like there’s a lot pushing back against that joy.

This Black History Month began with a flurry of blackface scandals: one involving Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who was reported to be photographed in his 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook in blackface—and Northam responded by denying it was him in the photo while admitting that on a separate occasion, he’d put on black shoe polish to look like Michael Jackson. The news was met with a flurry of calls for Northam to resign. “There is no place for racism in America,” former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted. “Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately, Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now.”

One of many people who’d lobbied for Northam’s resignation, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring subsequently revealed that, “In 1980, when I was a 19-year-old undergraduate in college, some friends suggested we attend a party dressed like rappers we listened to at the time, like Kurtis Blow, and perform a song,” admitting that he’d also worn blackface. “It sounds ridiculous even now writing it. But because of our ignorance and glib attitudes—and because we did not have an appreciation for the experiences and perspectives of others—we dressed up and put on wigs and brown makeup.”

Fashion giant Gucci was also blasted for a wool balaclava jumper on its website that mimics blackface. The piece is a black turtleneck, worn up over the nose, with a red-outlined cutout for the mouth. The outcry against Gucci came on the heels of a similar criticism of Prada products that resembled blackface; and soon after, athletic brand Adidas pulled back an ill-advised all-white Harlem Renaissance-themed sneaker, as did singer Katy Perry with her minstrel-esque shoes.

Hollywood superstar Liam Neeson inexplicably revealed his own racist inclinations during a now-infamous interview with The Independent. While promoting his latest action film Cold Pursuit, a movie in which his character exacts bloody revenge after his son’s murder, Neeson delved into his own history with bloodlust—and racism. He recounted a story about how he reacted to the news of a friend’s rape at the hands of a black perpetrator. The interview read:

“I went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I’d be approached by somebody—I’m ashamed to say that—and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some [Neeson gestures air quotes with his fingers] ‘black bastard’ would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could,” another pause, “kill him.”

Neeson’s firebomb of an admission became an international controversy and the actor would give a follow-up interview to Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts that only further stoked the criticism. “I went out deliberately into black areas in the city, looking to be set upon,” he said. “It shocked me and it hurt me... I did seek help, I went to a priest.” But Neeson’s candor doesn’t negate the undeniable racism of the story he’s shared and shouldn’t be used to squelch the justifiable reaction from the general public. If you find what he said relatable, that speaks to the cultural depths and societal scope of racist conditioning. And at that, everyone should be more than just taken aback.

And there’s the incident involving Jussie Smollett, the embattled star of Empire who was reported as having been attacked in a vicious hate crime in Chicago on January 29. On Jan. 22, Smollett, a gay black man, reported to police that he’d received a threatening letter at the Fox studio where his show is filmed; seven days later, he told police two masked assailants attacked him, pouring “an unknown chemical substance” on him (possibly bleach), wrapping a rope around his neck, and yelling, “This is MAGA country!” Two persons of interest were arrested, but this weekend it was reported that the police have shifted their focus to Smollett, who has been suspected of orchestrating the attack. “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” said Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Since those reports, there have been those rushing to indict both Smollett and the communities that rallied around him. It’s a reminder that so many are looking for any reason to unleash their contempt and rage against the efforts to empower victims; there has been gleeful schadenfreude coming from those who never want to take hate crimes seriously in the first place—especially when the victims are black and/or LGBTQ.

As more information is released involving what happened to Smollett, those who dismiss or even condone the marginalizing and oppression of black and LGBTQ citizens will revel in any opportunity to downplay the realities of what it means to be an “other” in America. As is always the case with bigots, any one person’s transgression will be used as ammo for disparaging an entire community or mindset—to decry one incident as proof we’ve “gone too far” in these efforts to ensure our friends, family and neighbors aren’t denigrated by the society in which they live. It’s important to remember, before you go to war with such people, that they will find validation in whatever unscrupulous act they can clasp onto as a sweeping indictment. You have no obligation to sway them. They’re bigots.

February is when so many Americans recognize the struggles and triumphs of black folks; a month where we celebrate all that it means to be black, and an amplified version of how we trumpet our heritage all year long. It’s been a mentally throttling BHM this year, however. Even though nothing diminishes our self-love, there have been so many affronts, scandals and head-scratchers this year that you almost forget that we’re supposed to be in a more celebratory mood: an incarcerated Bill Cosby likening himself to Martin Luther King, Jr., J. Lo’s headlining of what was allegedly a Grammy tribute to Motown, Candace Owens still being Candace Owens—it’s been a lot. Maybe we’ll have a better Juneteenth.

Black History Month 2019. One for the ages."

Chicago police are refusing to comment on a number of recent reports claiming that authorities believe Jussie Smollett orchestrated the Jan. 29 apparent hate attack on himself.

“While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement released on Sunday afternoon via Twitter.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

The spokesman went on to write that “detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

The police statement was released one day after multiple outlets reported that the two brothers who were arrested and released without charges in the case have reportedly claimed that the Empire star paid them to stage the incident.

According to CBS Evening News, a police source told the outlet on Saturday that the brothers said Smollett paid them to participate in the alleged incident and purchase the rope that was found around the star’s neck.

CNN also reported on Saturday that two Chicago police sources said investigators believe Smollett paid the men in exchange for carrying out the attack and the men are now fully cooperating with authorities.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement on Saturday, according to the Associated Press. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

“Detectives have reached out to his attorneys hoping to speak with him again,” Chicago police spokesman Thomas J. Ahern later said in a statement to PEOPLE.

Smollett responded to the reports in a statement released by his attorneys on Saturday. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” Smollett’s lawyers said. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continues. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate,” Smollett’s attorneys added. “At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

A rep for Fox, which airs Empire, had no comment, while the brothers’ attorney did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.

On Friday evening, Guglielmi said on Twitter that the two brothers who had previously been arrested were released after being called in for questioning by authorities.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging,” he tweeted.

“Detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Guglielmi added.

A spokeswoman previously told PEOPLE the pair was arrested Wednesday evening. Because they were not charged, police withheld identifying information about them.

The police spokeswoman also confirmed the suspects are the same people as those previously identified as persons of interest.

An attorney for the men, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS Chicago on Thursday that the men know Smollett from working on Empire and go to the same gym on occasion. Schmidt did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

Officials also recently denied reports that the attack on Smollett was staged.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Guglielmi said in a statement on Friday. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

Responding to the claims, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment also released a statement on Thursday, writing, “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” the statement said, adding, “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett was also brought in for questioning on Thursday.

At around 2 a.m. in Chicago on Jan. 29, Smollett transported himself to a doctor after he said he was the victim of an apparent hate crime.

“Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the statement continued. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

Early Thursday morning, Smollett appeared on Good Morning America for his first in-depth, televised interview since the incident occurred.

After detailing what occurred and hitting back at critics who have questioned the accuracy of his account, Smollett got emotional, saying he feared that his assailants won’t be found.

The Chicago Police Department had confirmed that Smollett, who is gay, was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery.” They also released two photos of the persons of interest; however, the images did not show the individuals’ faces.

“I want that [surveillance] video found so badly for four reasons,” Smollett said in the GMA interview. “Number one, I want them to find the people that did it. Number two, I want them to stop being able to say ‘alleged attack.’ Number three, I want them to see that I fought back. And I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought back. It does not take anything away from people who are not able to do that, but I fought back. They ran off, I didn’t.”

“Learn to fight. Learn to be a fighter,” he continued, addressing young gay men. “I am not advocating violence at all, so let’s be clear about that. If you’re going to die, fight until you do. If you don’t fight, you have no chance. I have fought for love. I’m an advocate. I respect too much the people — who I am now, one of those people — who have been attacked in any way.”

After being asked if one can heal if their attackers are never found, Smollett broke down.

“I don’t know. Let’s just hope that they are, you know what I’m saying? Let’s not go there yet,” he said, crying."

Try it. Frequently.

This week, now that the Chicago Police Department has “shifted the trajectory of the investigation” and now believes Jussie Smollett may have faked his own bias attack, we’ll be hearing apologies from a lot of progressive activists, celebrities and politicians.

With three simple words, they’ll disarm their detractors, pour oil on troubled waters. They’ll help to reunify a culture by admitting that sometimes their ideological opponents are correct.

Just kidding. Don’t hold your breath waiting for mea culpas from Cory Booker, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris, or (throwback time!) Al Sharpton, who opined that if Donald Trump simply remained silent on the Smollett matter, it would be sinister. The formerly successful actress Ellen Page blamed the nonexistent assault on … Mike Pence.

People said to be super-smart, and also Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, fell all over themselves to announce that they not only believed the woke 21st-century version of a 1980s abducted-by-aliens story but that they were in anguish about it. And they were not only in anguish but had detected an urgent sociological message about the nefariousness of the hateful right in America today.

Just to grease their path as they were skiing off the cliff, Trump pulled off one of his subtlest trolls yet when he publicly agreed with them, so they couldn’t accuse him of being insensitive. As an old military saying goes, never interfere with an enemy while he’s in the process of destroying himself.

Ariana Grande tweeted, “what happened to jussie makes me really f—ing sick to my stomach. i can’t believe s–t like this is really still happening everyday.” Yeah, I couldn’t believe it either, so I didn’t. GQ writer Joshua Rivera, in a piece blaming “late-stage whiteness,” came up with this unforgettable description of the supposed attack: “While its veracity isn’t confirmed, its sentiment needs no fact-check.”

“I stand with you @JussieSmollett. We all do. This is America. Unfortunately,” said actress and writer Lena Waithe on Instagram. Fortunately not, I guess. Writer Roxane Gay tweeted, “I am so sorry to hear what happened to @JussieSmollett,” adding that she was “committed to holding this administration and its ilk accountable for this hothouse of hate being fostered.”

Oscar-winning “Moonlight” director Barry Jenkins tweeted, “Thinking of Jussie. Saddened. Heartbroken. Angry. ALL of it…this is F***ED. This what all that hateful mongering has wrought. Are you PROUD???” The question might today be turned back on him: How proud are you feeling of Smollett? How ashamed do you feel of yourself now?

“I was wrong” solves so much, but this week the apologies will be few and grudging, if there are any at all. Some progressive hysterics — the progsterics — will quietly delete their outraged tweets (as activist Shaun King has already done). Some will simply stew silently.

Most will use the latest #NarrativeFail to find some other reason for bashing President Trump, Vice President Pence, their supporters, the Republican Party and anyone declared guilty of “gloating” after being proven correct to doubt Smollett’s ridiculous made-for-television story.

Progsterics who made the previously little-known actor the most talked-about TV performer in America for the last three weeks will denounce conservatives for not shutting up about the whole affair. Smollett won’t apologize either. Nor will he suffer much in the way of repercussions, because he “started a conversation,” meaning he smeared the right people.

Denzel Washington, in a 2016 speech, had some wise words about media practices. “In our society, now it’s just first — who cares, get it out there. We don’t care who it hurts. We don’t care who we destroy. We don’t care if it’s true. Just say it, sell it. Anything you practice you’ll get good at — including BS.”

Given how social media has become a publishing platform for anyone famous enough to attract an audience, actors and activists have become a huge new source of progsteria.

These loudmouths and lamebrains have no editors, no oversight and no standards. They live in their fantasies. So it’s hardly surprising that they’re among the biggest spreaders of fake news."

The “Empire” star is accused of orchestrating a fake attack on himself in January.

TMZ reports that law enforcement sources revealed that two brothers who were arrested last week in connections to Smollett’s alleged attack in Chicago, were released after authorities obtained “new information” in the case.

While it’s unclear exactly what the new information is, police reportedly found magazines in their Chicago apartment with some of the pages cut out. Smollett allegedly received a paper with magazine letters cut out that spelled, “You will die f**.”

The threat was mailed to Smollett eight days before the alleged attack.

Further, the brothers, who met Smollett while working as extras on “Empire,” reportedly bought the rope found around Smollet’s neck from the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store on January 25. While police reportedly have receipts of the purchase, security videos at the store erase after a week; authorities apparently didn’t obtain a warrant to search the videos in time.

When Smollett found out who authorities arrested, he supposedly declined to press charges, allegedly claiming he felt bad because he was friends with the brothers.

Police never found surveillance video of the alleged attack. Smollett claimed two men attacked him on January 29, called him”‘Empire’ fa***t” and “‘Empire’ n***er,” then poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around his neck while striking him.

CNN reports the Smollett denied making the attack up, but law enforcement sources close to the investigation said investigators think otherwise.

Late last month, the star shocked America when he said he’d been attacked while walking alone in downtown Chicago. He claimed to have been targeted by two men who were shouting racist and homophobic slurs in his direction. Not only is Smollett an African-American man who is openly gay, but he is famous for playing a gay character on Empire.

He said that during the attack, the men assaulted him, threw an unknown substance in his face, and put a rope around his neck. At first, many sympathized with the actor for having to go through such an ordeal. However, before long, inconsistencies were pointed out in his story, according to Celebrity Insider.

While it was originally believed that Smollett was a victim of a hate crime, new information released by the Chicago Police Department suggests that he may have orchestrated the entire event himself. Last week, two Nigerian brothers were arrested for possible relation to the alleged crime. They fit the vague description the actor gave of the men who attacked him and were caught on surveillance footage in the area where the attack was said to have taken place. However, both men were released by Friday due to new evidence.

#JussieSmollett Hired a ‘Crisis Manager’ to Handle Media After Alleged Attackhttps://t.co/LloYRTuZ7a — SEV (@Sev_Ren) February 13, 2019

Reports now claim that Smollett may have hired the brothers and staged the attack for reasons that are not yet known. Smollett continues to deny that he had anything to do with planning the attack, or that he gave police a false report. Nevertheless, with so much doubt now surrounding his story, it’s not looking good for his career or reputation.

To make matters worse, new reports say that the actor failed to hand over his cellphone to law enforcement at the start of the investigation. This is causing many to wonder what he has to hide.

As the situation grows in severity, Smollett has hired Anne Kavanaugh, a crisis manager. Kavanaugh’s Chicago-based firm helps deal with public scandals such as Smollett’s, in addition to providing other legal services. Still, many wonder if this is a mess to big for even her to attempt to clean up.

Twitter users spoke out in sympathy with Kavanaugh, who certainly has her hands full with this highly publicized issue.

“I feel sorry for her, this is a PR nightmare,” one user wrote."

LOS ANGELES -- The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the ""Empire"" star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive - and it's all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!""- a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump's election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett's own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack - something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers - or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had ""shifted"" - that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police ""are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released.""

Smollett's attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D'Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

""And Libs wonder why we don't believe their BS stories,"" Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push ""the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.""

The response from Smollett's celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn't know what to say, but that the situation is a ""mess"" and a ""travesty.""

""I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,"" Gay wrote. ""The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.""

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a ""modern-day lynching."" On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment ""until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.""

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she ""can't blindly believe"" the Chicago Police Department.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it's that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: ""Whatever the outcome, this won't stop me from believing others. It can't.""

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

""I'm not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,"" Gay wrote. ""Because more often than not they are telling the truth.""

One of the men bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request.

Cbslocal.com reports: The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

The brothers, who were questioned by police this week before being released, were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return.

They left for Nigeria later in the day on Jan. 29, after the attack.

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett.

The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening.

Smollett claims two men attacked him in Streeterville early Jan. 29 as he was heading to his apartment. He said they yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, poured a chemical on him and put a rope around his neck.

The brothers are now cooperating with police.

Since being released Friday night, the brothers have been staying in an undisclosed location.

Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said:

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Police raided the the brothers’ home on Wednesday, the same day police met them at O’Hare International Airport, as they were returning from Nigeria.

The two were in custody at Area Central detective headquarters since Wednesday night, before they were released on Friday evening.

Police at one point had placed them under arrest and referred to them as suspects in the case. Then, after interviews on Friday, they were released.

Pictures from the raid show the front door busted off its frame, items thrown across the living room, bedroom doors damaged and clothes tossed everywhere.

Police left behind an inventory list. Some of the items seized include a black face mask hat, an Empire script, phone, receipts, a red hat and bleach.

CBS 2’s Brad Edwards reported Thursday that a source with intimate knowledge of the investigation said investigators believe Jussie Smollett “potentially staged the attack.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, released a statement Saturday about the latest allegations.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity."

The responses were swift and brutal. But they boiled down to-""How dare you question that Smollett was anything other than a Black viciously assaulted by venomous Trump goaded racists?"" Anything less than outrage at homophobic, black hating Trumpites was nothing short of racial heresy and spewing right-wing Fox News talking points.

The counter-attack made some sense. Smollett is young, black, male, and gay. These are the prime attributes that seemingly make him a prime target. He also had an activist track record backing the parents of Trayvon Martin in their quest for justice in the murder of Trayvon. What didn't make sense were the holes in his story. And what made even less sense is the history and danger of a knee jerk scream of racism in cases such as this.

That history goes like this. A celebrated black entertainer, athlete, or official comes under withering fire for getting caught in a personal and or criminal indiscretion, wrong doing, or malfeasance, and they scream race. Bill Cosby is the latest and best known to flip the race card. He wasted no time in flipping it when he pleaded for the black media to remain ""neutral"" in the mounting furor and outrage over his alleged rapes of multiple women.

Cosby quickly walked down this tired, well-worn path for a good reason; in fact, several good reasons and none of them were any good. Others have done it before him. The litany of names from O.J. Simpson to Tiger Woods to Clarence Thomas is well known. They all had some things in common. They were wildly lionized as pillars of society. They said or did little or nothing about racial issues. And they were likely guilty when dumped on the legal and public scrutiny hot seat.

They had one more thing in common. They knew that by screaming that they were victims of a long-standing diabolical plot to demean, malign, pillory, and dehumanize black men, especially wealthy, prominent black icons, they could get a ready, sympathetic ear, and even circle the wagons push back by many African-Americans. Some black personalities have raised this ploy to a state-of-the-art enterprise when they are accused of, or nailed for, sexual hijinks, bribery, corruption, drug dealing and possibly even murder.

The wrong-headed misplay of the race card to cover or absolve blacks of abhorrent even criminal behavior and actions was on sorry display a decade ago during the rash of burnings of black churches. Nearly one-third of the more than 100 people arrested by FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms agents in the burning of over 200 churches were black. In some cases, there was strong evidence of a loose conspiracy by a disjointed group of racist whites to burn these churches. But this obscured the fact that the blacks that burned their own churches got a pass.

There was hardly any claim or case to be made of anything racial about their motives. They burned their churches out of revenge, anger, to conceal thefts, or to perpetuate insurance fraud. They were criminals and no one should try to excuse or justify their shameful acts. Despite the damning evidence, many blacks still clung to the racist conspiracy theory about the church burnings. Their blindness to reality was the ultimate in collective racial denial.

In the Trump era, it's even easier to see hidden plots, conspiracies, and diabolical plans to savage blacks behind every seeming allegation of racial victimization. Trump has unarguably opened the sewer and allowed many unreconstructed bigots of all stripes to ooze out and launch a barrage of racial digs, harangues, and in some cases physical assaults on blacks. The climate of hate is real, dangerous, and must be confronted. However, that's far different than reflexively assuming racial victimization when the evidence is scant, and likely rests solely on the word of one person making the charge.

Here 's the great damage done. And it has nothing to do with the proverbial crying wolf. It has everything to do with taking the legitimate sting, public outrage, and action that real, not invented, racial acts stir. Manufacturing a racial assault, which almost always is sooner than later uncovered, does in fact give aid and comfort to the Fox News talking heads and the right that delight in finger pointing blacks for eternally screaming race about everything. At the very least it's silly and counter-productive.

Smollett may well turn out to have been the victim of exactly what he said, a racist hate crime. However, when there are clouds of doubt about his claim or any other such claim, the wise course is to step back, take a deep breath, and wait to make sure the claim is more than a claim, but a fact. Smollett is another cautionary warning of the danger of not doing that.

LOS ANGELES - The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the ""Empire"" star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it's all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!""— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump's election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett's own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had ""shifted"" — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police ""are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released.""

Smollett's attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to co-operate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D'Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

""And Libs wonder why we don't believe their BS stories,"" Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push ""the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.""

The response from Smollett's celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn't know what to say, but that the situation is a ""mess"" and a ""travesty.""

""I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,"" Gay wrote. ""The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.""

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a ""modern-day lynching."" On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment ""until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.""

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she ""can't blindly believe"" the Chicago Police Department.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it's that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: ""Whatever the outcome, this won't stop me from believing others. It can't.""

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

""I'm not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,"" Gay wrote. ""Because more often than not they are telling the truth.""

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

The 11-year-old refused to recite the pledge, telling his teacher that he believes the flag is racist and America’s national anthem is offensive to black people, according to a Bay News 9 report that cited a statement the teacher gave to district officials.

The teacher, who was substituting at Lawton Chiles Middle Academy in Lakeland, Florida, then had what appeared to be a contentious exchange with the sixth-grader.

If living in the United States “was so bad,” why not go to another place to live? the teacher asked the student, according to the statement cited by Bay News 9.

“They brought me here,” the boy replied.

The teacher responded by saying, “Well you can always go back, because I came here from Cuba and the day I feel I’m not welcome here anymore I would find another place to live.”

The teacher said in the statement that she called the district office because she did not want to keep dealing with the student, Bay News 9 reported.

The student was later charged with disruption of a school facility and resisting an officer without violence, Gary Gross, a spokesman for the Lakeland Police Department, told The Washington Post. Gross said the agency can’t release further information because the student is a minor.

The Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem have been an increased source of tension after critics, including President Trump, denounced former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for taking a knee during the anthem, an act to protest racial injustice and police brutality.

But many also followed Kaepernick’s lead and defended his right to free speech and to protest.

In 2017, a black student was expelled from her Houston high school for refusing to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. India Landry’s silent protest prompted a lengthy legal battle in federal court, with the teen’s family accusing the school of violating her free speech rights. Last year, the Texas attorney general intervened and defended a state law requiring students to recite the pledge.

In the Florida school, district spokesman Kyle Kennedy told the Ledger that the student was arrested for being “disruptive and refusing to follow repeated instructions” from an officer and school officials – and not for refusing to recite the pledge.

Doing so is voluntary, Kennedy said.
