LOS ANGELES, Feb 4 — Actor Jussie Smollett appeared onstage in Los Angeles on Saturday in his first public appearance since he told police he was the victim this week of a racist and homophobic attack.

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama Empire, performed in West Hollywood less than a week after he reported to Chicago police that he was attacked on Tuesday by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck.

“The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all,” the 36-year-old actor and R&B performer told a crowd of hundreds of cheering fans, according to media reports.

He said his doctors had cleared him to perform at the show, which was scheduled before the alleged attack.

News of the alleged assault sparked outrage on social media, but some questioned Smollett’s account as the Chicago police have not found video evidence.

The ""Empire"" actor said Tuesday that he was attacked by two men who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"" in what Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime. He identifies as gay and plays a gay character on the series.

Smollett said one of his attackers put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

During his concert Saturday night at West Hollywood's Troubadour club, Smollett told fans that he wanted to clarify that following the attack, he was bruised but his ribs were neither cracked nor broken. He also said that he went to the doctor immediately, but he wasn't hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to perform at the concert.

""I'm not fully healed yet,"" he said. ""But I'm going to (be), and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all.""

Smollett: I can't let attackers win

Smollett thanked the more than 300 people gathered at the event and struck a defiant note.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all, I couldn't let those (expletives) ... win,"" he said, referring to his attackers. ""Above all I fought ... (expletive) back.""

He reiterated his calls for love, telling fans they needed to do away with hate because love is the only thing they had.

""I don't even care to name any names,"" he said. ""The hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop. But guess what, it stops with the people that believe in love.""

After the encore, an impassioned Smollett told the crowd, now is the time to be ""blacker"" and gayer.""

While this is his first public appearance since the attack, this is not the first time he has spoken out. In a statement first published by Essence on Friday, Smollett said his attack wasn't an isolated incident.

""These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,"" he said in the statement.

""During times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know,"" he said.

The investigation

Earlier this week, Smollett addressed speculation that he had changed his initial story and was less than forthcoming with authorities.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

Smollett's family issued a statement Thursday supporting the actor and condemning the attack, calling it a ""racial and homophobic hate crime.""

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning,"" the statement read. ""His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""

Chicago police have released photos of potential persons of interest in the attack and are asking for the public's help in identifying who they are.

Investigators said they have video of Smollett entering the hotel after the alleged attack with what appears to be a noose around his neck.

CNN's Don Lemon spoke to Smollett last week, and the actor told him he was shaken and angry that an attack like this could happen. He told him that he fought back against the attackers."

Jussie Smollett performed at an emotional concert on Saturday, February 2, days after he was attacked in Chicago in an apparent hate crime and used the platform to tell his story.

The Empire star, 36, took a break during the show to address the situation and share his heartfelt thanks to his friends and family for their support, noting that though he was injured, he didn’t suffer bruised or cracked ribs. Smollett added that he took himself to the doctor directly after the incident, however, he was not hospitalized.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let [them] win,” the Mighty Ducks alum told the crowd at the Troubadour in West Hollywood as he fought back tears. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

Smollett — who came out as gay during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres in 2015 — later joked to a cheering audience: “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Meanwhile, in Chicago, police superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters on Friday, February 1, that they are “making gains in the investigation” of Smollett’s report that his attackers shouted racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and tied a noose around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed to Us Weekly on Tuesday, January 29, that Smollett had transported himself to a local hospital following the incident that took place in the early hours of that morning.

TMZ reported on Friday that the California-born actor and singer had canceled the meet and greet that was supposed to take place prior to his concert on Saturday due to safety concerns.

Earlier that day, Smollett broke his silence on the attack, clarifying that he is “OK.”

The statement continued: “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me. With Love, respect & honor … Jussie.”"

""The most important thing I can say is 'thank you so much, and I'm OK,"" said the ""Empire"" actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

""I'm not fully healed yet,"" said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, ""but I'm going to be, and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all.""

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn't do that.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those (expletives) win,"" he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. ""I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.""

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

""And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,"" he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, ""I'm the gay Tupac.""

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she's glad he did.

""It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,"" Davis said. ""He showed everyone in the room he was strong.""

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he's not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in ""Empire,"" the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, ""Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night's set, along with songs from ""Empire.""

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

""To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,"" Joel Smollett Jr. said. ""But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie's healing. He's been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight."""

""I’m not fully healed yet,"" he said, ""but I’m going to be. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.""

Smollett plays Jamal Lyon on FOX's Empire, and like his character on the hit drama, Smollett is both black and openly gay. He was returning to his hotel from a Subway sandwich shop in the early morning Tuesday when the alleged assault occurred. Chicago police confirmed that the actor and singer reported his assailants shouted ""MAGA country"" during the attack, and that responding officers smelled bleach on Smollett's clothing. The police department told reporters that it located video footage of Smollett returning to his hotel with a noose around his neck after the attack, and released security camera images of two persons of interest they seek to question.

Just days prior, a letter containing white powder was sent to Empire’s Chicago set. A HAZMAT team responded and determined that the envelope contained crushed aspirin.

In the aftermath of the attack, Smollett’s colleagues and friends have been vocal in their support of the performer. Empire creator Lee Daniels posted an emotional video to Instagram.

You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown you, to be called ‘die f*ggot, *igga,’ or whatever they said to you. You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are. Because it shows we are united on a united front, and no racist fuck can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up Jussie. I’m with you. I’ll be there in a minute, because it’s just another fucking day in America.

Though Smollett’s celebrity made the attack news, hate crimes are all-too common. The number of such offenses reported to the FBI increased 17 percent from 2016 to 2017, and the total number of hate crimes tallied—7,175—is the highest figure the Bureau has reported in ten years. And experts suggest that the number could be higher still, as local jurisdictions vary in the accuracy of their reporting of such crimes to federal law enforcement. Just 12 states mandate that their police officers are trained to identify and investigate hate crimes. ""The current statistics are a complete and utter joke,"" a former Justice Department attorney told ProPublica in 2017.

Despite the high number of hate crimes nationwide, Smollett's report has come under fire amongst conservative media figures who suggest that it is little more than a hoax. During his concert, the actor read a statement in hopes of setting the record straight. ""I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately,"" said Smollett. ""I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all: I fought the fuck back.""

His siblings, who include fellow actors Jurnee and Jake, also took the stage Friday. Their brother Jojo Smollett read a statement saying that Jussie was hurt by the false reports that have trailed his story, and that they’d at first urged Jussie to cancel the show, since it occurred so soon after the attack. ""Then after much debating, some arguing, and many tears, my family and I realized that tonight is a an important part of Jussie’s healing,"" Jojo read. ""So on behalf of the Smollett family, we are so proud of our brother. And we are here tonight with all of you to give him confidence, the highest praise, and unyielding support as he shares his music, his soul, and his love to make this world a better place—and not to concede to hate.""

Nick Cannon used the hashtag to urge others to donate to Kaepernick’s Know Your Rights Camp, a free campaign that the former quarterback founded to educate youth on higher education, self-empowerment, and how to interact with law enforcement.

#ImWithKap#7Challenge! I am donating $7 to Colin’s Know Your Rights Camp. The number 7 symbolizes Kap’s jersey number.

Lena Waithe also shared the image of Davis wearing the jersey alongside a fist emoji.

While Jenifer Lewis didn’t use the #ImWithKap hashtag, she did include #TakeAKnee in her post of a song she wrote for Jussie Smollett. “You want a standing ovation, take a knee for the next generation,” she said in the video.

As previously noted, two caucasian males wearing ski masks reportedly attacked Jussie Smollett, put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him. As they left him, they reportedly screamed, “MAGA country.”

Drouin scored seconds after Canadiens goalie Carey Price made back-to-back saves on Leon Draisaitl and Darnell Nurse

Jesperi Kotkaniemi pulled Montreal even with 6:25 left in regulation, roofing the puck over Mikko Koskinen from a tight angle after Max Domi battled for the puck behind the net.

Domi and Shea Weber also scored for the Canadiens, and Price made 21 saves for his fifth straight victory.

Draisaitl scored twice for Edmonton, Connor McDavid added a goal and Koskinen stopped 23 shots. The Oilers have lost five games in a row, allowing 24 goals during the skid.

Peters resigned as Carolina’s coach last offseason and took over in Calgary. Shortly after, the Flames acquired Lindholm and Hanifin in a trade, and Ryan signed after three seasons in Carolina.

Garnet Hathaway, a Kennebunkport native, also scored, and David Rittich made 33 saves to help Calgary improve to 9-1-1 in its last 11 games. Sebastian Aho, Teuvo Teravainen and Dougie Hamilton scored for the Hurricanes.

Conley added eight rebounds and seven assists in a strong return to the lineup after missing a game with left knee soreness. Gasol chipped in nine rebounds in what could have been the longtime teammates’ final road game with the Grizzlies.

The team has fallen from playoff contention after a strong start and told the players it will listen to offers for both ahead of Thursday’s NBA trade deadline. Conley and Gasol both acknowledged it’s been hard not to think about their futures in recent days.

The Grizzlies have one more game before the deadline, at home Tuesday against Minnesota.

Justin Holiday added 19 points and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 16 in the Grizzlies’ first road victory since Dec. 23 at the Lakers. Memphis had lost three in a row and 17 of its last 19 overall.

Kevin Knox scored 17 points and DeAndre Jordan had 12 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks, who lost their 13th straight overall and 14th in a row at Madison Square Garden.

The Knicks started Dennis Smith Jr. and Jordan in their first game in uniform since coming to New York from Dallas along with Wesley Matthews on Thursday in the Kristaps Porzingis trade. Smith made the first basket of the game, but the Knicks shot just 38 percent against one of the league’s best defensive teams.

Smith finished with eight points and six assists.

RAPTORS 121, CLIPPERS 103: Kawhi Leonard scored 18 points, Serge Ibaka had 16 points and 12 rebounds and host Toronto beat Los Angeles for its 10th victory in their last 11 home games.

Ibaka has a career-best six straight double-doubles, Toronto’s longest streak since Chris Bosh had eight in November 2009.

Pascal Siakam and C.J. Miles each had 15 points, and Delon Wright added 14. All-Star guard Kyle Lowry sat out because of a sore back. Lowry also missed six games in December and January because of back pain. Fred VanVleet started in Lowry’s place.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the guard born in nearby Hamilton, had 19 points to lead Los Angeles. Lou Williams had 18. The Clippers have lost three of four.

Before the game, Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers bemoaned the tight turnaround his team faced from a 5 p.m. start Saturday in Detroit, in which the Clippers erased a 25-point deficit to beat the Pistons 111-101.

“This is a ridiculous back-to-back,” Rivers said.

Toronto, improved to 8-0 when playing with at least one day of rest and facing an opponent playing the second game of a back-to-back. The Raptors are 4-0 at home in such games.

“The most important thing I can say is thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the “Empire” actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubador in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had attacked him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The concert had been planned long before the incident.

Family members and others had urged Smollett to cancel the show while he recovers and police investigate.

But Smollett said he couldn’t do that.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,” he said to screams and cheers from the packed room.

“I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans.

Smollett kept the tone lighter through a celebratory hour-long set.

He addressed the attack again directly only toward the end of his hour-slong set.

He told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things. He was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

“And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,” he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said emphatically, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

It had floral accents on the bottom and on the bra portion, while the rest was made of sheer fabric. She wore her hair down in luxurious waves and looked straight at the camera with a slight smile. Recently, Padma has been sharing snippets from her past, including another throwback photo from January 25 that was a portrait of herself at 9-years-old.

Four days prior to that, Lakshmi shared a picture from her high school yearbook. At the time, she rocked curly bangs and what appears like pigtails, as she accessorized with drop earrings. Perhaps her flashbacks were inspired by the 10-Year Challenge that spread like wildfire on social media. But when Padma took part, she took it a step further with a 20-Year Challeng, and proved she’s maintained her looks impeccably in a new bikini snap.

With that being said, the model and TV personality has something else to celebrate, as she shared a video commemorating her milestone of surpassing 500,000 followers on Instagram. She sported a long-sleeved and turtleneck shirt to thank fans about helping her have a better week. No doubt she is still impacted by the recent death of one of her favorite Top Chef contestants, Fatima Ali.

The connection that Fatima had with Padma on her season of Top Chef was immediately clear, as the contestant held the TV host in high regard and discussed how important it was for Lakshmi to enjoy her food. After Ali passed away, Padma wrote a touching message to her friend, as detailed by Bravo TV.

“Goodbye lil’ sis. One of our brightest stars has fallen from the sky…. I have no words, but here are some of hers: ‘I dream of being better. I dream of being myself again, but I know I’ll never quite be the same, and that’s okay. I know I’ll be different, and, despite the worry that settles into me every time I wake up, I look forward to meeting that woman one day.’ #teamfati.”

Following some emotional tributes to Ali, Lakshmi transitioned to sharing a workout video of her as she did pull-ups while her legs were strapped in the air, so it looked like she was doing a backward plank. And later when the story of Jussie Smollett being attacked broke, Lakshmi shared a portrait of him and extended her sympathies."

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama Empire, performed in West Hollywood less than a week after he reported to Chicago police that he was attacked on Tuesday by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck.

""The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I'm okay. I'm not fully healed yet, but I'm going to be and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all,"" the 36-year-old actor and R&B performer told a crowd of hundreds of cheering fans, according to media reports.

He said his doctors had cleared him to perform at the show, which was scheduled before the alleged attack.

News of the alleged assault sparked outrage on social media, but some questioned Smollett's account as the Chicago police have not found video evidence.

Chicago police said they are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime."

Smollett told the crowd Friday he is OK but ""not fully healed yet,"" after he was attacked by two men in what Chicago police described as ""possible racially charged assault and battery.""

Smollett has released multiple statements standing by his initial account of the attack and clarifying that he is cooperating with authorities for the ongoing investigation.

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett performed at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California with his band Friday night in his first show since his reported attack earlier this week.

Smollett told the crowd Saturday he is ""not fully healed yet,"" after he was attacked by two men in what Chicago police described as ""possible racially charged assault and battery.""

After the attack, police said two men in ski masks approached an ""Empire"" cast member, yelling out ""racial and homophobic slurs."" The attackers then ""poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim"" and put a rope around his neck before leaving.

The 36-year-old actor, who identifies as gay and plays a gay character on the series, offered a message of hope before beginning his set to Saturday's crowd.

""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,"" Smollett said tearfully. ""We hope that you all stand with us.""

Alluding to reports that there were additional security concerns for Smollett's first public appearance since the attack, Smollett offered a defiant message.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,"" he said, prompting screams and cheers from about 400 people, according to the Associated Press. ""I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.""

Smollett also told the crowd he wanted to clarify reports of the attack, specifically that though he was bruised, none of his ribs were broken. The actor also said he went to the doctor but was not hospitalized.

""Above all, I fought the (expletive) back,"" he said to cheers, the Associated Press reported.

After a pause, Smollett laughed, ""I'm the gay Tupac.""

Smollett offered a similarly defiant tone in a statement provided to Essence on Friday, where he said he was OK but condemned the ""cowardly attacks.""

""As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,"" Smollett wrote. ""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.""

No arrests have been made in the investigation, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Police also identified two potential persons of interest who are seen in surveillance video near the area of the alleged attack.

""While the video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,"" Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department tweeted.

While multiple surveillance cameras failed to capture the alleged attack by two MAGA supporters, which reportedly took place near a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago, Emmy award-winning reporter Fox 32 Chicago reporter Rafer Weigel reported that a Chicago police source said surveillance did capture Smollet “still holding” his Subway sandwich when he returned to the building afterwards.

#ChicagoPolice source tells @fox32news that #JussieSmollett was seen on surveillance still holding his #Subway sandwich when he returned to the building after the alleged attack. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 1, 2019

This would suggest that either the “Empire” actor never dropped his sub during the terrifying attack he described, or that after being viciously attacked and left with a rope around his neck, he was still of the frame of mind to search for and retrieve his sandwich.

Even though he was allegedly doused in bleach.

Keep in mind that Smollett also said he was on his cell phone when the alleged attack occurred — never mind that he did not use that phone to immediately call police, waiting about 40 minutes to do so.

Interestingly, he spoke about the alleged attack Saturday night at a Los Angeles performance, his first since he belatedly reported the alleged incident.

Reading from a list, Smollett corrected the record on some things that were reported, telling the crowd his ribs were not broken and that he was not hospitalized.

He even said that he put up a fight.

No, Smollet did not mention his Subway sandwich, nor did he say what became of it as he was engaged in battle — though one social media user suggested it could have been a potential weapon.

If it had been a club sandwich, he could have used it as a weapon. — Hill?Buzz (@HillBuzz) February 1, 2019

“And above all, I fought the f–k back. I’m the gay Tupac (Shakur),” a defiant Smollet told the smattering of fans.

While racially motivated attacks are no laughing matter, to say that there are more than a few skeptics when it comes to the alleged attack on Smollett is no understatement.

And with that in mind, the Subway angle of the story proved to be serious fodder for social media snark.

Here’s a sampling of responses from Twitter:

Smollett performed for the first time since the racially-charged attack during performance at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on Saturday night (Feb. 2). During a break in the action he took some time to clear a few things up in regards to his attack.

""I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately,"" he said. ""I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take care, obviously and, above all, I fought the fuck back. I'm the gay Tupac.""

As previously reported, Smollett was reportedly assaulted by two men ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"" on Tuesday (Jan. 29). Following the assault, the men poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" onto the actor and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing on foot. Police are looking into the assault as a hate crime.

A number of rappers offered their well-wishes to the actor in the wake of the incident including 50 Cent, T.I. and Meek Mill.

Andrew Dalton/AP Jussie Smollett delivered an emotional set at The Troubadour on Saturday.

The investigation is ongoing.

""There are so many words on my heart that I want to say. The most important that I can say, to keep it simple, thank you so much... Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,"" a misty-eyed Smollett said on Saturday before launching into his emotional set.

""We hope that you all stand with us.""

The actor appeared despite his family reportedly cautioning him against performing.

""If I'm honest, as his big brother, I wanted Jussie to sit this one out,"" Joel Smollett Jr told People.

""I sincerely wanted him to stay out of the public until he heals. Then, after much debate, some arguing and many tears, my family and I realised that tonight is an important part of Jussie's healing.""

Jussie Smollett said he ""had to be here tonight"", adding that he couldn't let his attackers win.

Willy Sanjuan/Invision/AP Jussie Smollett told fans he's 'not fully healed yet' but he's 'gonna stand strong with y'all'.

""I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. I hope that you all stand with me.""

""Love is too short not to love who you want to love, and life is too long to not love who you love,"" he later added.

He played several emotional songs in the course of the night, including Heavy, which includes the lyrics ""Strong back, strong shoulders / Cause I'm holding up a lot... I refuse to let my people down. I'm the boss, I'm the leader.""

Throughout the night, the actor offered a message of love in the face of pain.

""In times of trauma or hurt or grief, we still have a responsibility to lead with love,"" Smollett said at one point. ""If we don't, then we just die inside, and we've got to... live, ya'll.""

He later added: ""The hateful rhetoric has to stop and it stops when you believe in love. People who celebrate love get wrapped up in so much hate. We cannot let that happen. We are destined to fail to even exist. Take love back. We have to take it back because it was ours to begin with. Hurt people hurt people, they don't know why.""

After finishing his set, the crowd roared until he returned to play a song titled Powerful. During the encore, he also clarified reports about the attacks - which varied wildly as the news broke Wednesday morning.

Evan Agostini/Invision/AP Police are investigating the assault against the actor as a hate crime.

""Just because there has been a lot of stuff that has been said about me that is absolutely not true,"" Smollett told the crowd. ""There are just a couple of points that I wanted to make really quick... I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked. I went to the doctor immediately - I was not hospitalised. Both my doctors in LA and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take it easy, obviously. And, above all, I fought... back.""

Smollett first spoke out about the attack on Friday in a statement to Essence magazine, and his comments on Saturday echoed that message.

""Let me start by saying that I'm OK,"" Smollett told Essence. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. ""

""As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.

""We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,"" he continued.

""Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""﻿"

According to Smollett, he was attacked in Chicago by two men who put a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him, all the while shouting racial and homophobic slurs. For the first time since the traumatizing incident, Smollett is speaking out about what he endured, according to CNN.

Smollett is an African American man who publicly identifies as gay, and portrays a gay character on hit drama series Empire. Many believe that Smollett’s attack was well planned, targeting him specifically for his racial identity and sexual preference.

After being bombarded with questions, concerns, and statements of support from fans, the actor wanted to speak out to assure everyone that he is going to be okay. Smollett appeared at a concert on Saturday evening at the Troubadour club in West Hollywood. His voice full of emotion, he recounted the experience and thanked fans for their support. The actor acknowledged that the incident could have been far worse, and he is grateful that he sustained only bruises. While he was transported to the hospital immediately following the attack, doctors told him that he had luckily gotten away without any broken ribs. He was later cleared to perform at the concert that evening.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” he said. “But I’m going to (be), and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

Smollett was adamant that he would not miss out on the concert. He felt that doing so would amount to letting his attackers win, giving them just what they wanted.

“I don’t even care to name any names,” he said. “The hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop. But guess what, it stops with the people that believe in love.”

In addition, the actor emphasized that the experience will not scare him into hiding or cause him to hide his identity. Whether he is accepted for who he is or not, he will continue to strive to be the most authentic version of himself. While this particular hate crime received widespread media attention, he acknowledges that it was certainly not an isolated incident, as members of minority groups experience this sort of terror every day.

Many fans in attendance at the concert — as well as other actors and actresses — have spoken out in support of Smollett for his courage and resiliency."

TMZ reports:

Jussie performed in WeHo at the famed Troubadour in front of a packed audience of 400 and generally addressed the incident in Chicago. He told the crowd he’s okay and still healing.

He asked for solidarity and the crowd was with him, as he said, “I’m going to stand strong with y’all.”

At the end of the show, Jussie lit up the stage with a call to action about being black, being gay and being proud. The crowd went absolutely wild.

Chicago police are still investigating the attack and Smollett says he is cooperating with the authorities in order to bring his attackers to justice.

Just days after falling victim to a viciously racist and homophobic attack in Chicago, actor and singer Jussie Smollett took the stage last night to assure fans and media that he was both in good enough health and spirit, as authorities begin their investigation.

At an intimate gathering in Los Angeles, Smollett took the opportunity to not only perform his single “Hurt People,” but also clarify some of the reporting on the details of his attack. Smollett claims that he sustained bruised ribs, not cracked or broken, as it was previously reported, states that doctors in both NYC and LA cleared him to perform ahead of his appearance, and caps with the corrective declaration “I fought the fuck back.”

But the Empire star isn’t letting hatred or a few bruised ribs win. Smollett took the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on Saturday both to perform and address the attack, defiantly shouting, “Be as black, be as brown, be as gay as the fuck you want to be!”

Smollett performed to a sold-out crowd Saturday night, opening his set with an update on his health and feelings after the January 29 attack. He acknowledged not having fully recovered—clarifying afterward that his ribs had been bruised, not broken—but stated, “The hateful rhetoric that gets thrown around, I’m not gonna name names, it has to stop But it stops with people who believe in love. Take love back because that’s all that we have . . . These last few days I couldn’t have gotten through without the love of my family and the love of y’all.”

According to Entertainment Weekly, the singer also said: “And above all, I fought the fuck back! I’m the gay Tupac.”

The performance was attended by Empire creator Lee Daniels and California Representative Maxine Waters, as well as Smollett’s brother Jocqui Smollett. “My family realized that tonight was an important part of Jussie’s healing,” Jocqui reportedly told the crowd. “On behalf of the Smollett family, we are so proud of our brother.” That said, a scheduled meet-and-greet for certain ticket-holders was justifiably canceled over security concerns.

Smollett was attacked in Chicago early in the morning of January 29, as two men confronted him with racial and homophobic epithets before allegedly pouring a chemical substance over him and wrapping a rope around his neck. The pair also allegedly yelled, “This is MAGA country!”—a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan. Chicago police have released video surveillance images of two persons of interest seen in the area at the time of the attack, but no arrests have yet been made."

(Reuters) - Actor Jussie Smollett appeared onstage in Los Angeles on Saturday in his first public appearance since he told police he was the victim this week of a racist and homophobic attack.

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” performed in West Hollywood less than a week after he reported to Chicago police that he was attacked on Tuesday by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck.

“The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all,” the 36-year-old actor and R&B performer told a crowd of hundreds of cheering fans, according to media reports.

He said his doctors had cleared him to perform at the show, which was scheduled before the alleged attack.

News of the alleged assault sparked outrage on social media, but some questioned Smollett’s account as the Chicago police have not found video evidence.

Addressing the crowd before singing, he said he had to go on with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win. He said;

“I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let these motherf*****s win. And above all, I fought the fuck back,” he said to cheers. Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh: “I’m the gay Tupac.”

“I’m not fully healed yet but I’m going to and I’m going to stand strong with y’all. I had to be here tonight,” Smollett, choking back tears, told the audience. “I couldn’t let those motherf—ers win!”

Police said Smollett was walking when two offenders started yelling the racist and homophobic slurs. The offenders then “began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” and one put a rope around his neck, according to police. Smollett later told detectives his attackers yelled about “MAGA,” referring to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Towards the end of his set Saturday, Smollett said that he had suffered bruises, but his ribs were not cracked or broken, adding that he was not hospitalized and that both his doctors in L.A. and Chicago “cleared” him to perform.

“And above all, I fought the f— back,” he said to a roaring crowd. “I’m the gay Tupac.”

This wasn’t the first time Smollett addressed the incident. Earlier this week, the actor spoke out about speculation that he had changed his initial account o the attack.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” he said. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Chicago police released phots last week of “potential persons of interest” in the attack which showed two silhouettes walking in the area of where Smollett was sometime between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m., but does not show the actual attack.

The performance marked the first time he’d been on stage since he was assaulted in Chicago on January 29.

Smollett’s family opened up the show with their own speech before giving him the stage. The actor/singer was obviously dealing with a lot of emotions but managed to address the fans in attendance with a clear message.

“I have so many words on my heart that I wanna say,” he said. “The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m OK … I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all. It sounds … I had to be here tonight, y’all. It sounds proud, but I couldn’t let those motherfuckers win.”

He added, “I will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me. So thank you.”

Later in the show, Smollett took an opportunity to clarify what injuries he suffered in the alleged hate crime.

“I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken,” he explained. “I went to the doctor immediately … I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take care, obviously. And above all, I fought the fuck back.”

Smollett’s speech at The Troubadour wasn’t the first time the singer has publicly spoken about the hate-fueled assault, which was allegedly perpetrated by two masked attackers shouting racial and homophobic slurs. Last Friday (February 1), he issued an official statement to the press.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett stated. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”"

“The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the “Empire” actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn’t do that.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,” he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

“And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,” he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she’s glad he did.

“It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,” Davis said. “He showed everyone in the room he was strong.”

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he’s not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in “Empire,” the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, “Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night’s set, along with songs from “Empire.”

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

“To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,” Joel Smollett Jr. said. “But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie’s healing. He’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.”"

(Reuters) - Actor Jussie Smollett appeared onstage in Los Angeles on Saturday in his first public appearance since he told police he was the victim this week of a racist and homophobic attack.

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” performed in West Hollywood less than a week after he reported to Chicago police that he was attacked on Tuesday by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck.

“The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all,” the 36-year-old actor and R&B performer told a crowd of hundreds of cheering fans, according to media reports.

He said his doctors had cleared him to perform at the show, which was scheduled before the alleged attack.

News of the alleged assault sparked outrage on social media, but some questioned Smollett’s account as the Chicago police have not found video evidence.

Jussie Smollett performed last night for the first time since being attacked in Chicago earlier this week, telling the crowd at the Troubador in West Hollywood that “he had to be here tonight, y’all” as he fought back tears, according to Variety. “I can’t let the motherf—ers win.”

The “Empire” actor, who is gay, says his two attackers used both homophobic and racial slurs on January 29 and wrapped a rope around his neck to simulate lynching. Chicago police are investigating the incident as a hate crime.

“I have so many words on my heart,” Smollett said. “The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to.

And I hope that you all will stand with me. So now…let’s do it.”

“Just because there has been a lot of stuff said about me that’s absolutely not true…” said the actor and singer, likely in reference to some online commenters’ doubts about his account of the incident. “I’m sure my lawyer’s sitting up there like, ‘No, Jussie, no! No! Shut the f— up and sing.'”

Smollett had notes with him onstage and shared “four points” with the audience: “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately…I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all: I fought the f— back.”

Smollett also referred to himself as “the gay Tupac” and concluded the evening by announcing, “We are proud. We are gay.”

Donald Trump, Who once complained that the NFL was getting too soft just admitted that he believes football is “a dangerous sport” and he’d have a “hard time” allowing his son Barron to play.

Trump sat down for an interview with CBS News’ Margaret Brennan who asked Trump if he would let his 12-year-old son Barron play football if he chose to.

“It’s very, it’s a very tough question,” Trump said. “It’s a very good question. If he wanted to? Yes. Would I steer him that way? No, I wouldn’t.”

Trump then went on to explain, “I just don’t like the reports that I see coming out having to do with football — I mean, it’s a dangerous sport and I think it’s- really tough.”

“I thought the equipment would get better, and it has. The helmets have gotten far better, but it hasn’t solved the problem.” “So, you know I hate to say it because I love to watch football. I think the NFL is a great product, but I really think that as far as my son — well I’ve heard NFL players saying they wouldn’t let their sons play football. So … it’s not totally unique, but I would have a hard time with it.”

Ironically, back in 2017, Donald Trump complained that the NFL was ruining the game for adding to many penalties to big hits!

Andrews | The Washington Post

Jussie Smollett appeared publicly Saturday night for the first time after being reportedly attacked in Chicago earlier this week.

Smollett performed songs from his debut record and the Fox show “Empire,” on which he portrays an openly gay R&B singer, at West Hollywood’s Troubadour club, where he said he is “not fully healed yet, but I’m going to (be), and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The actor said he was attacked in Chicago around 2 a.m. Tuesday by “two unknown offenders” who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown “chemical substance” on Smollett and wrapped a thin, white rope around his neck. Chicago police said they are investigating the assault against the actor, who is black and openly gay, as a hate crime.

The investigation is ongoing.

“There are so many words on my heart that I want to say. The most important that I can say, to keep it simple, thank you so much. … Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,” a misty-eyed Smollett said on Saturday before launching into his emotional set. “We hope that you all stand with us.”

The actor appeared despite his family reportedly cautioning him against performing.

“If I’m honest, as his big brother, I wanted Jussie to sit this one out,” Joel Smollett Jr. told People. “I sincerely wanted him to stay out of the public until he heals. Then, after much debate, some arguing and many tears, my family and I realized that tonight is an important part of Jussie’s healing.”

Smollett said he “had to be here tonight,” adding that he couldn’t let his attackers win. “I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. I hope that you all stand with me.”

“Love is too short not to love who you want to love, and life is too long to not love who you love,” he later added.

He played several emotional songs in the course of the night, including “Heavy,” which includes the lyrics “Strong back, strong shoulders / Cause I’m holding up a lot … I refuse to let my people down. I’m the boss, I’m the leader.”

Throughout the night, the actor offered a message of love in the face of pain.

“In times of trauma or hurt or grief, we still have a responsibility to lead with love,” Smollett said at one point. “If we don’t, then we just die inside, and we’ve got to … live, ya’ll.”

He later added: “The hateful rhetoric has to stop and it stops when you believe in love. People who celebrate love get wrapped up in so much hate. We cannot let that happen. We are destined to fail to even exist. Take love back. We have to take it back because it was ours to begin with. Hurt people hurt people, they don’t know why.”

After finishing his set, the crowd roared until he returned to play a song titled “Powerful.” During the encore, he also clarified reports about the attacks — which varied wildly as the news broke Wednesday morning.

“Just because there has been a lot of stuff that has been said about me that is absolutely not true,” Smollett told the crowd. “There are just a couple of points that I wanted to make really quick … I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked. I went to the doctor immediately — I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take it easy, obviously. And, above all, I fought … back.”

Smollett first spoke out about the attack on Friday in a statement to Essence magazine, and his comments Saturday echoed that message.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett told Essence. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. ”"

And he had something to say before launching into his set.

""I am not fully healed yet, but I'm going to, and I'm gonna stand strong with ya'll,"" the actor/singer said during a concert at the Troubadour club on the Sunset Strip.

Referencing the heinous attack, Smollett added:

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those motherf-ckers win. So I will always stand for love.

""I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope that you all stand with me.""

Smollett was taken by surprise by two assailants around 2 a.m. last Tuesday on his way back from Subway.

These attackers tied a rope around his neck and poured bleach all over him, committing an obvious hate crime against someone who is African-American and openly gay.

Speaking to the audience last night, Smollett actually clarified a few details around the incident.

He said that he was driven to see a doctor but was not hospitalized... suffered bruises but did not break any ribs...and was cleared by his physicians to perform this weekend.

""And above all, I fought the f-ck back,"" he said, drawing loud cheers. ""I'm the gay Tupac.""

Folks all over Hollywood have sent Smollett their best wishes, while President Donald Trump did not address the alleged fact that the suspects screamed to Smollett that he's in ""MAGA country.""

But the Commander-in-Chief did say the following about the attack on the Empire star:

“That I can tell you is horrible. I’ve seen it. Last night. It’s horrible. Doesn’t get worse.”

Before Smollett began his set yesterday, his siblings Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Jazz Smollett, Jake Smollett, Jocqui Smollett and the eldest, Joel Smollett Jr., took the stage.

Said Joel to the crowd:

""Jussie is a true artist, that's how he breathes.

""But above all else, above all else, he is the epitome of love.

""So on behalf of the Smollett family, we are so proud of our brother and we are here tonight with all of you to give him confidence, the highest praise and unyielding support as he shares his music, his soul and his love to make this world a better place and not to concede to hate.""

Jussie then came out and hugged his relatives.

The day before Smollett broke his silence about the hate crime.

He said via statement:

My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.

Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.

I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.

Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me."

Alfonso Cuaron has won the Directors Guild Award for top feature film for “Roma,” keeping up his awards-season momentum.

Cuaron topped Bradley Cooper for “A Star Is Born,” Spike Lee for “BlacKkKlansman,” Adam McKay for “Vice,” and Peter Farrelly for “Green Book.”

“Thank you, cabron — you are my film career,” a deeply moved Cuaron told last year’s winner, Guillermo del Toro.

Cuaron explained backstage that he had used “cabron,” often an expletive in Spanish, as a term of endearment for del Toro. “Like everything else, it’s a matter of context,” he added.

Cuaron also thanked Participant Media, which financed the black-and-white Spanish-language film, and Netflix, which released it, for their “glorious stupidity.”

The filmmaker singled out Oscar-nominated stars Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira.

“‘Roma’ simply doesn’t exist without the generosity of spirt and effortless grace of Yalitza and Marina,” he said. “They somehow, with the rest of my beautiful cast, managed to bring to life this film from my memory.”

“Roma,” which is set in Mexico City in the 1970s, is based on Cuaron’s boyhood.

It’s the second time that the DGA has honored foreign-language film, 18 years after Ang Lee won for “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” And it’s the second DGA Award that Cuaron has won, five years after taking the trophy and the directing Academy Award for “Gravity.”

Cuaron won the Golden Globe for directing “Roma” against the same four men — Cooper, Farrelly, Lee, and McKay. Cuaron also won the director award from the New York Film Critics Circle.

The DGA Award is one of the top indicators of Oscar glory, with all but seven of the DGA winners since 1948 going on to take the best director Oscar — including del Toro last year for “The Shape of Water.” The last divergence came in 2013 when Ben Affleck won the DGA Award for “Argo,” even though he did not receive an Oscar nom.

About 80% of DGA nominees have gone on to be in the running for an Academy Award in recent years. Cuaron, Lee, and McKay have been nominated for an Oscar this year, along with Yorgos Lanthimos for “The Favourite” and Pawel Pawlikowski for “Cold War.”

Mexico-born directors have won four of the last five directing Oscars, starting with Cuaron in 2014, followed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for “Birdman” and “The Revenant,” and del Toro for “The Shape of Water” last year. Damien Chazelle won the DGA Award and Oscar in 2017 for “La La Land.”

Cuaron’s script for “Roma” is up for a Writers Guild of America award, which will be announced on Feb. 17. “Roma” scored 10 Oscar nominations, tied with “The Favourite.” The Academy Awards will take place Feb. 24.

McKay was still a big winner, taking home the drama series award for HBO’s “Succession.” Ben Stiller nabbed the movies for television and limited series prize for Showtime’s “Escape at Dannemora.”

“This is a dream come true,” Stiller said. “I’ve wanted to be a director since I was 8 years old.”

Tim Wardle’s “Three Identical Strangers” won the documentary award over “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?,” “RBG,” “Free Solo,” and “Hale County This Morning, This Evening.”

“Three Identical Strangers” did not receive an Oscar nomination. Wardle gave a shoutout to Lee for “Do the Right Thing,” saying that it had changed his life.

In an upset, Bo Burnham received the first-time directing award for “Eighth Grade,” topping Cooper, who had been widely expected to win, Carlos Lopez Estrada for “Blindspotting,” Matthew Heineman for “A Private War,” and Boots Riley for “Sorry to Bother You.” The comedy-drama starred Elsie Fisher as an insecure eighth-grader in the final week of school.

“I didn’t think this was mathematically possible,” a stunned Burnham said in his speech.

Bill Hader won the comedy series award for the first episode of HBO’s “Barry.” It topped two episodes of “Atlanta” and two from last year’s winner, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” Hader won the Emmy for actor in a comedy series in September.

“I first came to this ceremony is 2001 when I was a PA on ‘James Dean: An Invented Life’ so be nice to your PAs,” Hader said in his acceptance speech.

Cuaron, in accepting his nomination medallion earlier in the night, took a shot at the Trump administration in noting that many of the world’s 70 million domestic workers are immigrants. “When we vilify them, calling them rapists, we diminish ourselves,” he said.

Cooper gave a passionate reaction to receiving his medallion, saying, “It’s the humanity of making films. I love it so much. I’m never going to stop.”

DGA president Thomas Schlamme opened the ceremony by sending well wishes for a speedy recovery to DGA member Jussie Smollett, who was attacked earlier this week in Chicago in what local law enforcement is investigating as a hate crime. He also promised that the DGA, which has 17,000 members, will push for more inclusion of women and minorities.

“Unions are under near-constant threat,” he said. “Our industry is one of the last strongholds of labor. It’s something that we must never take for granted

Aisha Tyler hosted the event at Hollywood & Highland Center, noting, “Last year’s host Judd Apatow has been recast as a six-foot-tall black woman.”

She evoked major laughter on her opening set by saying she was nostalgic for the presidency of George W. Bush: “He was a cute dumb, not a ‘We’re all gonna die’ dumb.’”

The first award went to Jack Jameson for children’s programs for “Sesame Street’s” “When You Wish Upon a Pickle: A Sesame Street Special.” The variety/talk/news/sports winner was Don Roy King for “Saturday Night Live: Adam Driver; Kanye West” and the variety/talk/news/sports specials victor was Louis J. Horvitz for the “60th Grammy Awards.” King has now won the category for “Saturday Night Live” for four consecutive years.

The reality programs prize went to Russell Norman for the “Japan” segment of Netflix’s “The Final Table.” Spike Jonze of MJZ won the commercials award for “Welcome Home, Apple Homepod.”

FX Networks’ John Landgraf received the DGA diversity award and cited a 2015 Variety article spelling out diversity problems at the cabler as a spur to actively seek changes.

Associate Director Mimi Deaton received the Franklin J. Schaffner Achievement Award and Unit Production Manger Kathleen McGill was awarded the Frank Capra Achievement Award and fell down while walking up to the podium, evoking a standing ovation. “I’m not nervous anymore, that’s for sure,” she said when she began speaking.

Quincy Jones presented Don Mischer, best known for handling live events such as the Olympics and presidential inaugurations, with the previously announced lifetime achievement award in television. He’s won 10 DGA Awards.

“When I was 12, I built my own TV studio in my garage,” Mischer said. “It’s hard for me to put into words how it feels to be included with all of you.”

Here is the complete list of the DGA Awards winners."

Jussie Smollett took the stage Saturday night in his first performance since he was brutally attacked earlier this week in Chicago.

The Empire star performed to a sold-out show at Los Angeles’ Troubadour, using the opportunity to share a message of resilience with his fans.

“I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to, and I’m going to stand strong with you all,” he told the crowd.

He also clarified specific details about the attack, including the facts that he had suffered bruises, not any cracked ribs; that he had gone to a doctor promptly; that he was not hospitalized; and that his doctors in LA and Chicago had said he could perform.

“And above all, I fought the f*** back,” he added.

Smollett was grabbing a quick bite from a local Subway Tuesday morning when he was attacked by two men wearing “Make America Great Again” hats. The thugs beat him, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him, and tied a noose around his neck while calling him racist and homophobic slurs.

Smollett is now set to have 24/7 armed security at least until the two men who attacked him Tuesday morning are apprehended. He had to cancel the scheduled meet-and-greet with fans in L.A. on Saturday due to security concerns.

“For security reasons, we cannot accommodate any meet & greets,” the email to ticketholders said.

The FBI and Chicago Police Department are investigating the attack as a possible hate crime. Investigators have located a surveillance camera that shows people who are now wanted for questioning, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement on Twitter.

Smollett exclusively told ESSENCE that he’s recovering, but that he’s thankful for the mass outpouring of support he’s received over the last few days.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett began in his statement to ESSENCE. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. “"

“It’s not true. It’s just completely not true,” Bush told TMZ. “There are 32 backup quarterbacks. Kaepernick is better than all 32 backup quarterbacks, and he’s better than some starting quarterbacks. I can name a few, but I won’t do it for their sake.”

—Father of Chicago teenager said school resource officers were too aggressive in using stun gun and punching his daughter after incident—

The truth is the NFL is not giving Kap a chance due to him taking a knee for Black lives and against racial injustice, not for the dubious claims Goodell made in the State of the NFL press conference. The ostracized quarterback has what it takes to help an NFL team win, Bush said. He should know: he’s seen it up close and personal.

“Kaepernick should be in the NFL right now, but he’s not ’cause none of the owners are giving him a shot,” Bush told TMZ.

During the press conference when Goodell was asked about the league’s collusion against Kaepernick, Goodell said “I’ve said it many times – privately, publicly – that our clubs are the ones that make decisions on players that they want to have on their roster… I think if a team decides that Colin Kaepernick or any other player can help their team win, that’s what they’ll do. They want to win, and they make those decisions individually in the best interest of their club.”

—At first show since the attack, Jussie Smollett tells fans, he can’t let mother****** win—

Hey, sports fans, the day has arrived in which “men and women gather round their ludicrously gargantuan flatscreens to watch people attempt to cripple each other in order to celebrate capitalism’s rousing defeat over such nefarious forces as ’empathy’ and ‘moderation.'”

That’s the Super Bowl according to Dave Schilling, an American sportswriter who has contributed a think piece on the game in general (not tonight’s in particular) to the left-wing British publication The New Statesman. The essay sounds so much like a parody of what a clueless left-wing British intellectual would think about the Super Bowl that I wonder if this is the sports equivalent of the Sokal Hoax.

Avers Schilling, “My household Super Bowl tradition involves each guest being forced to eat an entire bucket of fried chicken in one sitting. The last person to finish gets punched in the stomach.” Did that really happen or does that sound like the kind of thing you’d tell a Brit who would believe any gluttony story you can offer about us?

Schilling adds, “The Super Bowl might not be quite as pedantic [sic] as watching a person stand around doing nothing, but it is on at an unseemly hour [in the U.K.] and features esoteric, labyrinthine rules that can alienate even the most devoted follower of the NFL” and “NFL games are one of the last places that it’s socially acceptable to enjoy country music.”

Rehearsing some extremely tired points about Colin Kaepernick (that guy? still?), Schilling insists that the ex-quarterback’s “thesis” has been backed up by “everything from Charlottesville to the latest tragedy [sic] involving Empire star Jussie Smollett.”

Schilling predicts tonight’s game will take a political turn: “Surely, another front will open up in this rhetorical pillow fight. Maybe halftime show performers Maroon 5 will unfurl a Palestinian flag during their set. Could Patriots quarterback Tom Brady remove his jersey to reveal a ‘Build the Wall’ t-shirt?” Pursuant to that, he longs for the relative cultural distance of Britain, which unlike the U.S. is a place where people don’t have to fret about the politics of the Super Bowl: “I envy all those in the UK, able to watch Sunday’s game without wondering what it says about you as a citizen.”"

(Danny Moloshok/Reuters)

Jussie Smollett, the gay black actor who appears on the TV show Empire, wants the world to know he’s okay. He did a concert last night during which he addressed the alleged hate-crime assault he suffered early Tuesday morning near a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago. In his latest comments on his case Smollett said,“There has been a lot of stuff said about me that’s absolutely not true.” He then paused to glance at the balcony and add, “I’m sure my lawyer’s sitting up there like. ‘No, Jussie, no! No! Shut the f*** up and sing.’” Consulting his notes, he moved on to “four points” he said he wanted to make: “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately. . . . I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all: I fought the f*** back.”

Smollett has previously said he was talking to his manager on his cellphone during the attack and still had that phone after the attack. Chicago reporter Rafer Weigel of Fox32 News tweeted that police sources had confirmed that Smollett also still had the Subway sandwich on him when he turned up at an apartment building shortly after the alleged attack.

So Smollett underwent a vicious beating by two attackers that apparently lasted less than 60 seconds, since that is the reported gap in surveillance footage between an image of him without a rope around his neck and an image of him with the rope. Smollett now says he fought back, but apparently he lost neither his Subway sandwich nor his cell phone in this brawl. Also he didn’t immediately call the police on that phone to describe the suspects and inform the police which way they had gone when they suddenly ran away from him, but instead waited about 40 minutes to inform the police.

Also Smollett for some reason thinks his lawyers are eager for him not to publicly discuss the case. Curious."

Performing for an audience of more than 300 fans at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California , Smollett also addressed some of the rumors about the attack :

“I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately...I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take care, obviously. And above all, I fought the fuck back.”

Police are investigating the January 29 attack on Smollett as a “possible hate crime,” after two men wearing ski masks yelled racial and homophobic slurs while they beat him, placed a noose around his neck, and doused him with an unknown chemical substance.

Earlier this week, Smollett’s family issued a statement that called the attacks “domestic terrorism”:

“ We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

Chicago police are still looking for two persons of interest in connection with the attacks . The suspects are described as white men, one of whom was “ 5-foot-10 to 6-foot-1 and about 170 pounds,” according to The Washington Post.

After his encore , Smollett told the crowd to “Be as black, be as brown, be as gay as the fuck you want to be. Now is the time. B e blacker, be gayer, do it right the fuck now.”"

Smollett was reportedly assaulted on Tuesday morning by two men who lobbed homophobic and racist slurs at the actor, put a noose around his neck, and doused him in an unknown chemical substance.

Various accounts of what allegedly happened have surfaced in the days since the incident, many of them attributed to anonymous officials rather than named police officers or Smollett himself. That's led to some conflicting views of what actually happened.

Smollett hit the stage in a West Hollywood nightclub on Saturday with the intention of setting the record straight. Using notes scrawled down on a crumpled piece of paper, the actor ticked off four points of fact that have been the subject of some confusion.

""Just because there's been a lot of stuff said about me that's absolutely not true ... there's just a couple of points I want to make really quick,"" he said.

""I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately ... I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in LA and in Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care obviously.""

Then he added: ""And above all, I fought the fuck back."" The crowd cheered Smollett into silence for a good 30 seconds before he spoke again, with a joke to break the tension and get the show rolling: ""I'm the gay Tupac."""

Video of the incident show Chicago police officers, who are assigned to Marshall High School, using a stun gun on Dnigma Howard — who responded by grabbing the gun — and swinging at the girl with a closed fist after they tried to remove her following an altercation, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Dnigma, who was charged with two felony counts of aggravated battery against police, was suspended Tuesday morning, but allegedly refused to leave the school.

—At first show since the attack, Jussie Smollett tells fans, he can’t let the mother****** win—

“My first instinct was to protect her,” Laurentio Howard, who witnessed most of the confrontation between his daughter and police, told the Sun-Times. “But they told me to step back, so I could only watch. I told them they didn’t need to do that. I think it really just shows that officers like that shouldn’t be in a school.”

Chicago Public Schools (CPS) issued a statement in response to the incident, saying the officers involved will not return to the school.

“CPS strives to create safe and supportive learning environments for all students, and this disturbing incident has absolutely no place in our schools,” district spokesman Michael Passman said, according to the Sun-Times. “To ensure a thorough review of this situation is conducted, we are asking the district’s Office of the Inspector General to review the matter and we will fully support the ongoing investigation by the City’s Civilian Office of Police Accountability.”

This incident is a reminder of longstanding issues between Chicago police and CPS. Last year, a report from the Inspector General’s office found problems with the way police officers are used in CPS schools, faulting both entities for failing to keep records of where the officers were deployed and finding that officers lacked the training to deal with conflicts with students.

Chicago police said they would make adjustments, including working with CPS to define the responsibilities of school resource officers as part of a wide-ranging consent decree filed in federal court that stemmed from a 2017 lawsuit, the Sun-Times reported. The consent decree, which was protested by the Chicago police union, was approved Thursday by U.S. District Judge Robert Dow.

After this latest incident, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Sun-Times that police “take these complaints very seriously.

“If the family feels they need to, they can file a complaint” with the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which investigates alleged misconduct, Guglielmi said.

Police said when they sought to remove Dnigma Howard from school, she kicked, bit and spit at them, causing three officers to fall down a flight of stairs. The officers were taken to University of Illinois Medical Center for injuries and Dnigma was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital and released.

The teen appeared for an initial hearing Friday in Cook County Juvenile Court, where Judge Linda Pauel ordered her placed on electronic monitoring and banned her from the school’s grounds.

Dnigma denies the officer’s version of events. In an interview with the Sun-Times, she said she grabbed an officer’s vest, only after she was pushed first and that both of them fell. She said a female police officer punched her several times, causing a cut to her face. She said she bit the officer’s hand in retaliation, after which she said she was struck with the stun gun."

He is accused of allegedly staging an attack in Chicago with the help of two other people.

Empire actor and musician Jussie Smollett told fans at a concert in Los Angeles late Saturday that while he has “not fully healed yet” from a possible hate crime that left him hospitalized several days ago, “I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

Smollett, who is Black, gay, and Jewish, told Chicago police Tuesday that he was accosted by two people who assaulted and subjected him to racist and homophobic slurs.

His assailants are alleged to have battered his face before pouring what has been described as an unknown chemical substance on him. “At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck,” the police report reads.

Police confirmed Wednesday that the attackers yelled “MAGA country,” during the attack, a sign that the assailants were likely inspired by the inflammatory and racist rhetoric of President Donald Trump, who has yet to release a statement on the attack. Since Trump took office, hate crimes have increased, reaching the highest level in more than 10 years.

Smollett’s public appearance on Saturday was the first since he was hospitalized days ago. He told a cheering audience of nearly 300 people that it was important to him to “be here tonight … I couldn’t let those (expletives) … win … Above all, I fought … (expletive) back.”

“I don’t even care to name any names,” he added. “The hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop. But guess what, it stops with the people that believe in love.”

He also told his fans not to be afraid to be “blacker and gayer.”

Chicago police are still investigating the attack and have not yet made any arrests. They have released photos of possible suspects and have asked the public to aid in identifying them."

Timothy and Tina Hauschultz and their 15-year-old son made the 7-year-old, whose name was Ethan, hold a 44-pound log for two hours every day for a week, Newsweek reports. While being monitored during his punishment, a medical examiner believes that the teen hit and kicked the younger boy 100 times, rolled the heavy log over his chest and stood on his head and body while Ethan was face-down in a puddle. He then allegedly buried him in ""his own little coffin of snow."" Ethan died in April 2018 of hypothermia and blunt force trauma.

The Hauschultz's son has been charged with first-degree reckless homicide, while his father Timothy, 48, is charged with felony murder and felony contributing to the delinquency of a child. Both the father and son face an additional number of charges. Tina, 35, is charged with failing to prevent bodily harm and intentionally contributing to the delinquency of a child.

The 15-year-old told police that he was put in charge of supervising Ethan and his twin, who were both undergoing the punishment of carrying logs for not knowing 13 Bible verses of Timothy's choosing. Ethan's birth mother, Andrea Everett, spoke out after the boy's death in April.

Chicago police said they are investigating the assault against the actor, who is black and openly gay, as a hate crime.

The investigation is ongoing.

“There are so many words on my heart that I want to say. The most important that I can say, to keep it simple, thank you so much. . . . Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,” a misty-eyed Smollett said Saturday before launching into his emotional set. “We hope that you all stand with us.”

AD

The actor appeared despite his family reportedly cautioning him against performing.

“If I’m honest, as his big brother, I wanted Jussie to sit this one out,” Joel Smollett Jr. told People. “I sincerely wanted him to stay out of the public until he heals. Then, after much debate, some arguing and many tears, my family and I realized that tonight is an important part of Jussie’s healing.”

Jussie Smollett said he “had to be here tonight,” adding that he couldn’t let his attackers win. “I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. I hope that you all stand with me.”

“Life is too short not to love who you want to love, and life is too long to not love who you love,” he later added.

He played several emotional songs in the course of the night, including “Heavy,” which includes the lyrics “Strong back, strong shoulders / Cause I’m holding up a lot . . . I refuse to let my people down. I’m the boss, I’m the leader.”

Throughout the night, the actor offered a message of love in the face of pain.

“In times of trauma or hurt or grief, we still have a responsibility to lead with love,” he said at one point. “If we don’t, then we just die inside, and we’ve got to . . . live, ya’ll.""

He later added: “The hateful rhetoric has to stop and it stops when you believe in love. People who celebrate love get wrapped up in so much hate. We cannot let that happen. We are destined to fail to even exist. Take love back. We have to take it back because it was ours to begin with. Hurt people hurt people, they don’t know why.”

After finishing his set, the crowd roared until he returned to play a song titled “Powerful.” During the encore, he also clarified reports about the attacks — which varied wildly as the news broke Wednesday morning.

“Just because there has been a lot of stuff that has been said about me that is absolutely not true,” Smollett told the crowd. “There are just a couple of points that I wanted to make really quick. . . . I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked. I went to the doctor immediately — I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take it easy, obviously. And, above all, I fought . . . back.”

Smollett first spoke out about the attack on Friday in a statement to Essence magazine, and his comments Saturday echoed that message.

“Let me start by saying that I’m okay,” Smollett told Essence. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. ”

The Empire actor and singer proceeded with a scheduled show at the Troubadour, in Los Angeles, California, where he delivered an impassioned conclusion to his set, clarifying some of the reports that circulated about the attack itself—he was not hospitalized, but did see a doctor; his ribs are bruised, not broken—and urging the audience to “be as black, be as brown, be as gay as the f--k you want to be,” according to a tweet by Entertainment Weekly’s Tim Stack.

Smollett released his album, Sum of My Music, in March of last year, and the Troubadour show was scheduled before last week’s attack; in an introduction to the show, according to Vulture, Smollett’s brother Jake said he had urged Jussie not to proceed with the show. “As his big brother, I wanted Jussie to sit this one out,” he said. “But after much debating, much arguing, and many tears, my family and I realized tonight is an important part of Jussie’s healing. You see, he has been a fighter since he was a baby.” (Smollett, per Vulture’s account of the set, was still visibly bruised from the attack; though he proceeded with the show itself, a planned meet-and-greet was canceled.) Later, towards the end of his set, Smollett said something similar: “Above all, I fought the f--k back.”

Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Empire creator Lee Daniels, Smollett’s sister Jurnee Smollett-Bell, and actor Wilson Cruz were among the show’s attendees, again per Vulture. Before he launched into the two-hour-long show, Smollett explained his own reasoning for proceeding with the show. “I couldn’t let those motherf--kers ruin it,” he said, echoing the statement he issued to Essence earlier in the week that “there is still a responsibility to lead with love.” “I will always stand for love,"" he said; ""I will never stand for anything else.”"

His performance came less than a week after he was assaulted by two assailants in Chicago on Tuesday, Jan. 29. During his show, the actor and singer paused to clear up some points about the attack, as well as to reiterate that while he's not completely healed, he's not letting his attackers keep him from doing his work.

""I have so many words on my heart,"" the actor said to the crowd, per Variety. ""The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I'm okay. I'm not fully healed yet, but I'm going to. And I'm gonna stand strong with y'all… l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me.""

Smollett was attacked by two assailants while he was walking in downtown Chicago in the early hours of Tuesday morning. According to the actor, two men in masks yelled homophobic and racial slurs at him before beating him, drenching him in an ""unknown chemical substance"" according to police, and putting a rope around his neck. They then fled the scene. According to CNN, the Chicago police department is investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. Smollett is openly gay and black, and he also plays an openly gay character on Empire.

Smollett paused during his concert to clarify some the details surrounding his attack. In a video from Entertainment Tonight, he told the audience that his ribs weren't cracked or broken. He also said that he went to the hospital immediately after the attack, but he was never hospitalized. Doctors in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to perform on Saturday night. ""I had to be here tonight, y'all,"" he said. ""I can't let the motherf*ckers win."" The actor also wanted the audience to know that he ""fought the f*ck back.""

The actor was joined at his concert by his family, Empire creator Lee Daniels, and Rep. Maxine Waters. Smollett's brother Jojo introduced him to the crowd, saying, ""There’s been an outpouring of love and support … There's also been (inflammatory) stories spread that have hurt him deeply. I sincerely wanted him to stay out of the public until he healed. And after much debate, some arguing and many tears, my family and I have realized that tonight is an important part of his healing. You see, he's been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night and he continues to fight. Jussie is a true artist every time he breathes. But above all else, he is the epitome of love.""

Saturday's concert was not the first time Smollett and his family have commented publicly about the attack. On Friday, the actor issued a statement to Essence, ""Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

He continued, ""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

In the wake of the attack, there's been an outpouring of support for Smollett from Hollywood and beyond. Not only have his fellow actors been sharing messages of love for the Empire star, politicians and social activists have spoken out against the possible hate crime. No one's words are quite as powerful as Smollett's though, and by returning to the stage on Saturday, he further proved just how determined he is not to let hate win."

Smollett performed “Heavy” from Empire, which he said now “has a new meaning to me,” as his Empire “family” watched on from the audience.

“In times of trauma or hurt or grief, we still have a responsibility to lead with love,” the actor said. “If we don’t, then we just die inside, and we’ve got to f—ing live, ya’ll. The hateful rhetoric that gets thrown around — I’m not going to name no names, I don’t care to… it has to stop. But guess what — it stops with the people that believe in love.”

“We have literally only just begun,” Smollett continued. “I would not have been able to get through it without obviously my family, but also the love and support of all ya’ll. I don’t take it lightly… I’m so proud of myself.”

Smollett left the stage, but the crowd cheered for an encore. After returning to the spotlight, Smollett performed “Powerful” and took the time to clarify reports about the apparent hate crime.

Earlier in the night, Smollett’s siblings appeared on stage to support their brother.

“If I’m honest, as his big brother, I wanted Jussie to sit this one out,” said Joel Smollett Jr. “I sincerely wanted him to stay out of the public until he heals. Then, after much debate, some arguing and many tears, my family and I realized that tonight is an important part of Jussie’s healing.”

“He’s been a fighter since he was a baby,” Joel Jr. continued. “He fought his attackers that night and he continues to fight. Jussie is a true artist every time he breathes, but above all else, he is the epitome of love.”

The star was allegedly attacked by two black-clad, masked men in Chicago’s Streeterville section near his home on Tuesday. Smollett was treated at Northwestern Hospital.

On Friday, Smollett spoke out for the first time about the incident, telling Essence in a statement: “Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he continued. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me. With love, respect & honor…Jussie.”

At around 2 a.m. in Chicago on Tuesday, Smollett transported himself to the hospital after he was the victim of an apparent hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department previously confirmed in a statement that a member of the hit Fox show was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery.”

“Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” continued the statement. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

On Thursday, Smollett’s family released a statement about the attack.

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” they said. “Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.”

In a statement, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face or any despicable act of violence and hatred — and especially against one of our own.”

The Fox show’s creator, Lee Daniels, also spoke out about the incident, calling the actor his “son” and saying, “It’s just another f—ing day in America.”"

Jussie Smollett performed at the West Hollywood’s Troubadour on Saturday in his first public appearance since being assaulted in Chicago earlier this week. The Empire star addressed the attack as he held back tears in front of the super supportive audience.

“The most important thing that I can say is to keep it simple and say thank you and I’m okay,” the star confirmed. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to and I’m going to stand strong with you all. I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let those motherf***ers win.”

Smollett also set the record straight about a few details regarding the attack. According to him, his ribs were bruised—not cracked as was initially reported—and he did fight back during the assault. “I’m the gay Tupac,” he said about himself.

As was previously reported, Jussie was attacked by two masked men allegedly shouting racial and homophobic slurs while walking outside of his Chicago apartment. The attackers reportedly hit him multiple times, poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. No suspects have been apprehended as of yet.

Before his appearance this weekend, Smollett issued an official statement where he explained that he is working with authorities to ensure justice is served. His message to the Los Angeles audience was of the same positive vein: “So, I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope you will all stand with me.”"

Well, Akon things they are “stupid.”

TMZ specifically asked the 45-year-old about Black artists declining to perform at the Super Bowl’s hallf time show. Akon babbled, “Honestly, I think that’s stupid.” He continued, “I’m going to be as frank as possible, you in this business for two reasons, one is to make an impact and two is for the business of it. Now if you’re a philanthropist and that’s something you feel like you believe in and you fight for it, you have every right. But if you’re doing it and you’re looking it as a way of expanding who you are as an artist and as a business, you also have that right. So I don’t think there’s a right or wrong answer for that.”

He then added, “I think sometimes people take social issues and make it a lot serious than it has to be.”

Sounds like Akon doesn’t know the history of Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith, John Carlos and countless others. See the foolishness below:

In case you missed it, Maroon 5 agreed to perform at the Super Bowl in February and allegedly asked several Black artists to perform, too. Mary J. Blige, Lauryn Hill, Andre 3000, Cardi B, Usher and Nicki Minaj all reportedly said no. Rihanna gave a hard no back in October and even P!nk declined. But Travis Scott said yes, and the rapper was promptly trampled by social media.

Maroon 5 ignored a Change.org petition, which had more than 75,000 signatures, asking them not to perform.

While talking to TMZ back in December, Rev. Al Sharpton said, “I think that anyone who goes into the Halftime Show is in effect is directly violating those that want to raise the question that the NFL should come to terms with what they have done and continue to do to Colin Kaepernick and those that protest on criminal justice issues.”

He also said, “He should do what a lot of other major artist have done and say, ‘I can’t participate.’ You can’t fight Jim Crow and then sit in the back of the bus.”

Sounds like Akon likes the back of the bus. If you didn’t know, Akon was born in St. Louis, Missouri but describes Senegal as his “hometown.”

""The most important thing that I can say is to keep it simple and say thank you and I'm OK,"" Deadline reported the actor and singer told the audience. ""I'm not fully healed yet, but I'm going to and I'm going to stand strong with you all.""

The Hollywood Reporter said Smollett, 36, sang songs from his TV show and his debut album Sum of My Music.

The gay, African American artist also said on stage that he had been advised against performing so soon after he was attacked on a street in what police said they are investigating as a possible hate crime. He said he decided the show must go on because he didn't want his assailants to ""win.""

Smollett has said two men yelled racist and homophobic remarks at him before beating him and putting a rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, but police said they want to speak with two unidentified men whose images appeared on surveillance-camera footage around the time of the incident.

No video of the actual attack has been found, police said.

""The hateful rhetoric has to stop and it stops when you believe in love,"" Smollett said at his concert Saturday. ""People who celebrate love get wrapped up in so much hate. We cannot let that happen. We are destined to fail to even exist. Take love back. We have to take it back because it was ours to begin with. Hurt people hurt people, they don't know why."""

I can’t let the motherf—ers win.”

“I have so many words on my heart,” Smollett said, according to Variety magazine. “The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all… l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me. So now… let’s do it.”

Before he hit the stage, Smollett’s brother, Jojo, introduced him, saying, “There’s been an outpouring of love and support … There’s also been (inflammatory) stories spread that have hurt him deeply,” according to Variety magazine. “I sincerely wanted him to stay out of the public until he healed. And after much debate, some arguing and many tears, my family and I have realized that tonight is an important part of his healing. You see, he’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night and he continues to fight. Jussie is a true artist every time he breathes. But above all else, he is the epitome of love.”

When Smollett took to the stage at his sold-out concert, he had some words to get off his chest. The actor/singer spent time rebutting false rumors and addressing skepticism about his account of the attack.

“Just because there has been a lot of stuff said about me that’s absolutely not true…” he began. Then he looked up in the balcony, before going on. “I’m sure my lawyer’s sitting up there like: ‘No, Jussie, no! No! Shut the f— up and sing.’”

Speaking from notes, Smollett said there were “four points” in particular he wanted to clarify: “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately… I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all: I fought the f— back.”

The audience erupted into cheers. “I’m the gay Tupac! So now, we can do our encore.”

After the encore was over, Smollett told the crowd: “We are proud. We are gay.”

Rep. Maxine Waters, filmmaker Lee Daniels, and actor Wilson Cruz were among those in attendance for the show. Smollett teared up addressing Cruz.

—Federal jail in Brooklyn has gone a week without heat—

“I promised myself I was not gonna cry tonight… Someone in the crowd that I want to recognize: Wilson Cruz is someone I identified with growing up. I stand on the backs of so many people — of the Lee Daniels and the Wilson Cruzes — and I pray to God I make you all proud,” he said.

Later in his performance, Smollett introduced a song about his boyfriend, saying “over these last four days, my man… Everybody should be blessed enough to have a love like that. But love will f— you up.” On another song, he gave daps to the Lyons, his fictional work family. “A lot of my ‘Empire’ family (is) here. Happy to bring to life my character Jamal Lyon. This song, it kind of has a new meaning for me,” Smollett said, according to Variety, making a segue into “Heaven.”

In his first statement, released exclusive to theGrio, the Smollett family said:

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.

“The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the “Empire” actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is Jewish, black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn’t do that.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,” he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

“And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,” he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she’s glad he did.

“It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,” Davis said. “He showed everyone in the room he was strong.”

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he’s not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in “Empire,” the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, “Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night’s set, along with songs from “Empire.”

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

“To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,” Joel Smollett Jr. said. “But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie’s healing. He’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.”"

Fists fly. It’s two against one, though, and once the immoral majority is finished pummeling their minority prey, they leave the black man with two souvenirs: a noose around his neck and a bucket of bleach over his head.

A scene from Montgomery, Alabama, circa 1963? No, this one unfolded much closer to home. It happened one night … well, actually early one morning, on January 29, 2019, in Chicago. The black man wasn’t just a random unwelcome negro. It was actor and singer Jussie Smollett, a gay black man who plays a gay black man on the FOX series Empire.

Welcome to Trump’s America.

According to TMZ, Smollett was on his way to a Subway restaurant shortly after arriving in Chicago from New York when two white men approached him. One of them yelled “Aren’t you that f*ggot Empire n*gger?” before launching the assault. Afterwards, they put a rope around Smollett’s neck, poured bleach on him and said, “This is MAGA country.”

No matter how many times we hear about homophobic and racist attacks, a fresh hate crime is always shocking. This one, which left Smollett hospitalized with a bruised face and fractured rib, sent a particularly potent shiver down my spine. It felt different — not just because the victim was a celebrity, but also because of how specific the assailants’ actions were. It’s almost like they wanted to recreate a scene from a bygone era, a time before the Civil Rights Act and the Stonewall riots made being black and gay in America somewhat safer … until now.

I’ve been living outside of the United States for more than 12 years now (for the entire presidency of Barack Obama, for the entire social media era), and it’s been nine since I last stepped foot inside my country. When I left Sydney in June of 2017 after two and a half years there, I meant to go back to the U.S.A., but I kept talking myself out of it. Twenty months and 24 Asian and European countries later, I’m in London, one flight and a few weeks away from making my grand re-entrance into American society, and mentally, I feel like I’m back where I started.

I don’t want to go home. It’s not that I’m afraid of returning. It’s this: Do I really want to go back to a place where I’m not wanted?

When I told two European friends about my resurgent trepidation in light of the Smollett attack, they reminded me that hate crimes happen everywhere, even in Europe. They weren’t telling me anything I didn’t already know. It’s not like I haven’t had to face racism and homophobia during my last 15 months spent traveling around Europe.

But, I pointed out to them, this was not just another white-nationalist moment. It was symbolic and uniquely American. It couldn’t have happened anywhere else. The noose the men placed around Smollett’s neck and the bleach they poured over his head were intentional symbols of a bygone American era when whites ruled the earth, from sea to shining sea.

“This is MAGA country.” Would that have been said in London? In Prague? It was a specific declaration that only could have been made in Trump’s America, a place where the President of the United States indirectly endorses racism by suggesting that white supremacists can be “very fine people.” It’s a place where a white teenager from Kentucky facing off with an elderly Native American man on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial becomes a sign of the times because he’s wearing a hat that says “Make America Great Again,” which happens to have been Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign slogan.

I’ve been hesitant to damn Nick Sandmann, the 16-year-old Covington Catholic High School junior who became infamous at the Lincoln Memorial on January 18. That’s mostly because I felt the media purposely focused on him and his MAGA hat, glossing over the four black men, self-proclaimed Hebrew Israelites, who had set the chain of events in motion with their racist and homophobic taunts against Sandmann and his classmates.

If the kid hadn’t been wearing a MAGA hat, would his smirk have seemed less like an affront to common decency? Would the scene have appeared more like what it probably was: two stubborn people staring each other down?

That’s my personal interpretation of those events, but the Smollett attack underscores the stinging subtext of “MAGA.” It’s not an innocent acronym for a well-meaning slogan. It’s become a mantra for a new but old nationalism, something that, in the wrong hands, can be used as a weapon against the very groups that made America great in the first place.

Chillingly, this may not have been Smollett’s first brush with MAGA. TMZ reports that the website ThatGrapeJuice.Net posted a letter in an envelope addressed to Smollett with “MAGA” in the upper left corner. Inside was a piece of paper with cut out letters spelling, “You will die black f–.” TMZ confirmed that the letter was sent to the FOX studios in Chicago where Empire is filmed, eight days before the attack.

It’s ironic that these events have unfolded in Chicago, a major northern and Midwestern U.S. city with a significant black population. It’s been home to Oprah Winfrey and Michael Jordan, and, most auspiciously, it’s the hometown of one Kanye West.

Yes, that Kanye West, the Trump disciple who proudly wore his own MAGA hat on Saturday Night Live last September. I wonder if this is the America that the father of three wants to pass on to the next generation, a place where blacks and gays are unwelcome.

Whether we want to face it or not, it’s once again a place where a 2 a.m. trip to Subway can send you on a brutal and painful ride to the depths of hell — just for being black and gay. May God help us all."

Even though he is not fully healed, he powered through his performance and didn’t leave the stage without expressing gratitude to his fans.

“The most important that I can say, to keep it simple, thank you so much. I’m okay… I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. I’m going to stand strong with y’all.”"

""I'm not fully healed yet,"" said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, ""but I'm going to be, and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all,"" he said to cheers from the audience at the The Troubadour in West Hollywood, Calif.

Smollett, who appears in the popular show ""Empire,"" still had a swollen knot on his face during the show, after two men allegedly beat him, poured what appeared to be bleach on him and draped a noose around his neck while using racist and homophobic slurs in Chicago on Tuesday.

Smollett's siblings embraced him as he stood on stage before beginning the concert, which was attended by about 400 people, including Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.

After thanking everyone for their support, Smollett also took the time to address some misconceptions and the ""hateful rhetoric"" surrounding his attack. Some attempted to poke holes in Smollett's story by saying that he changed his original story, after he said in a follow-up interview with police that the two masked men who beat him shouted ""MAGA Country"" during the attack.

'EMPIRE' ACTOR JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S FAMILY RELEASE STATEMENT

He released a statement earlier this week defending himself from those attempting to portray him as a liar. ""I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,"" he said. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

He also clarified while on stage on Saturday that his ribs were bruised during the attack but not cracked, and that he had been medically cleared to perform. The concert was planned well before the incident, and family and friends reportedly urged him to postpone it for his own health and safety. Smollett, however, said he felt compelled to use the concert as a chance to spread a positive message.

Addressing the Troubadour nightclub in West Hollywood, with a crowd that included Congresswoman Maxine Waters, filmmaker Lee Daniels, and actor Wilson Cruz., the Empire star declared: “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the motherfuckers win.”

“I have so many words on my heart,” Jussie Smollett said. “The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all. l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me.”

In his statement to police following the incident on Tuesday morning, Smollett alleged that he was approached by two individuals who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him. One of the men allegedly hit him in the face before pouring an “unknown substance” over his head and wrapping a noose around his neck.

However, many have cast doubt on the details surrounding the attack, including the seriousness of Smollett’ss injuries and whether he was subject to racist and homophobic abuse.

“Just because there has been a lot of stuff said about me that’s absolutely not true,” he said. “I’m sure my lawyer’s sitting up there like. ‘No, Jussie, no! No! Shut the fuck up and sing.’

“I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken,” he explained. “I went to the doctor immediately… I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all: I fought the fuck back.”

After reviewing hundreds of hours of footage, local police have so far failed to identify any suspects for the attack, while it emerged on Friday that Smollett had refused to turn over his cell phone records to investigators. Police later released blurry images of two persons of interest in the alleged attack, who are only seen on the opposite side of the street in the surveillance footage

“I don’t even care to name any names,” he added. “The hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop. But guess what, it stops with the people that believe in love.”

Feb. 3 (UPI) -- Empire star Jussie Smollett, who is recovering from a recent assault in Chicago, performed as scheduled at the Troubadour club in Los Angeles on Saturday night.

""The most important thing that I can say is to keep it simple and say thank you and I'm OK,"" Deadline reported the actor and singer told the audience. ""I'm not fully healed yet, but I'm going to and I'm going to stand strong with you all.""

The Hollywood Reporter said Smollett, 36, sang songs from his TV show and his debut album Sum of My Music.

The gay, African American artist also said on stage that he had been advised against performing so soon after he was attacked on a street in what police said they are investigating as a possible hate crime. He said he decided the show must go on because he didn't want his assailants to ""win.""

Smollett has said two men yelled racist and homophobic remarks at him before beating him and putting a rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, but police said they want to speak with two unidentified men whose images appeared on surveillance-camera footage around the time of the incident.

No video of the actual attack has been found, police said.

""The hateful rhetoric has to stop and it stops when you believe in love,"" Smollett said at his concert Saturday. ""People who celebrate love get wrapped up in so much hate. We cannot let that happen. We are destined to fail to even exist. Take love back. We have to take it back because it was ours to begin with. Hurt people hurt people, they don't know why."""

“The most important thing I can say is ’thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the “Empire” actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn’t do that.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,” he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

“And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,” he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she’s glad he did.

“It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,” Davis said. “He showed everyone in the room he was strong.”

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he’s not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in “Empire,” the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, “Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night’s set, along with songs from “Empire.”

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

“To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,” Joel Smollett Jr. said. “But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie’s healing. He’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.”

Smollett did say he was not yet fully healed, but that he would be, thanking fans for their support. ""Thank you so much, and I'm okay,"" he reassured them.

He also took the opportunity to clear up some misunderstandings about the attack after a week in which he and his family both released statements asserting his story has never wavered. He clarified that while his ribs were bruised, none were broken; he said he was never actually hospitalized, but did see a doctor immediately; and, jokingly referring to himself as a ""gay Tupac,"" he proudly told the audience that he ""fought the f-ck back.""

Smollett, who is black and gay, reported being attacked after leaving a Subway sandwich shop around 2 a.m. Tuesday by two white men in ski masks who allegedly pulled a noose around his neck, shouted racial and homophobic slurs, and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, as TMZ first reported. Chicago police have released images of two people seen near the site of the attack, saying they are persons of interest wanted for questioning.

Returning to the stage at the end of his sold out concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood for an encore, he unfolded a small piece of paper and read from it.

“There’s been a lot of stuff that’s been said about me that’s absolutely not true,” he began.

“We don’t believe that shit,” a fan in the VIP area yelled out, to which the rest of the audience cheered and Smollett laughed.

“I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken,” he continued. “I went to the doctor immediately. Frank Gatson drove me. I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care obviously. And above all, I fought the fuck back.”

The crowd erupted in applause.

“I’m the gay Tupac,” he joked.

Smollett says he was attacked by two men early Tuesday on the way to Subway. They assaulted him, poured bleach on him, and put his head in a noose, according to reports. Chicago police are treating the incident as a hate crime after confirming that Smollett said his attackers yelled ""MAGA country"" as they assaulted him and used a racial slur. They released images of two “persons of interest” in the case Wednesday.

The entire Smollett family, who released a joint statement following the attack, was in attendance at the concert. They took the stage in solidarity with their brother at the start of the show. Also in the crowd were Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Empire director Lee Daniels, activist DeRay Mckesson, and actor Wilson Cruz among others.

Girl group June’s Diary, discovered by Kelly Rowland, served as the opening act and background for Smollett who performed tracks from his debut album and Empire. Many of the songs, including “Conqueror,” “Heavy,” “Freedom,” and “Hurt People,” took on new meaning as he fought back tears in front of a supportive audience. His resilience was palpable and manifested a performance at once defiant and triumphant.

Before he left the stage, Smollett paid homage to the Black (and brown) queer men who’ve come before him.

“I just want to say that I stand on so many backs of so many people. I stand on the backs of the Lee Daniels’. I stand on the backs of the Wilson Cruz’s and the Bayard Rustin’s and the Langston Hughes’ and the James Baldwin’s and the Alvin Ailey’s, and I pray to God that I made y’all proud.”

Smollett continued, “I’m okay… I’m not fully healed yet but I’m going to, and I’m going to stand strong with y’all.”

Smollett also touched on the attack itself, saying that, contrary to reports, he was never hospitalized following the attack (he instead went to a doctor) and that he didn’t suffer cracked ribs, the Associated Press reports. Doctors in both Los Angeles and Chicago, where the incident occurred, both cleared Smollett to perform Saturday’s show.

According to police, two still-unidentified men yelled “racial and homophobic slurs” toward Smollett as the actor walked home on a Chicago street. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. During the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck,” the Chicago Police Department said.

“The hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop. But guess what, it stops with the people that believe in love,” Smollett told the crowd Saturday. “Be as black, be as brown, be as gay as the fuck you want to be. Now is the time: Be blacker, be gayer, do it right the fuck now.”

Saturday’s concert was Smollett’s first public appearance since the attack.

Smollett was attacked by two masked men allegedly shouting racial and homophobic slurs while walking near his Chicago apartment. The attackers reportedly hit him multiple times, doused him with bleach, and put a noose around his neck. No suspect has been apprehended in what's being investigated as a hate crime.

The brutal attack led many to speak out against what Chicago police are labeling as a ""possible hate crime."" Empire co-creator Lee Daniels spoke out in support of Smollett while the actor/singer's family called the incident ""domestic terrorism.""

The Empire star went ahead with a previously scheduled concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, Calif., where he addressed the assault, as well as his aggressors.

“The most important thing I can say is thank you so much, and I’m OK,” Smollett said, according to the Associated Press. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to [be], and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.

“I had to be here tonight,” he continued. “I couldn’t let those motherf–kers win. I will always stand for love…. regardless of what anyone says, I will only stand for love.”

At the end of his performance, Smollett clarified the extent of his injuries. He said that his ribs were bruised, but not cracked. He saw a doctor, but was not hospitalized.

“Above all, I fought the f–k back,” he said, before adding with a laugh, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Per the Chicago Police Department, Smollett was walking down the street early Tuesday morning when two individuals approached him and began yelling racial and homophobic slurs. The offenders then became physically violent, battering the actor with their hands and pouring an “unknown chemical substance” on him, per the CPD. At some point during the altercation, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene.

The actor also told police that the perpetrators referenced President Trump’s rallying cry, “Make America Great Again,” during the attack, per The Hollywood Reporter. (Trump later called the incident “horrible.”)

On Friday, Smollett put out a written statement, assuring fans that “my body is strong but my soul is stronger.” Though he expressed frustration with “certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread” since the attack, he said he remains grateful for the community’s support and reiterated that such “cowardly attacks” happen often in the LGBTQ community.

Jussie Smollett stood tall Saturday night as he made his first public appearance since Tuesday's attack, telling hundreds of fans, ""I had to be here tonight. I couldn't let these motherf*****s win.""

Jussie performed in WeHo at the famed Troubadour in front of a packed audience of 400 and generally addressed the incident in Chicago. He told the crowd he's okay and still healing.

He asked for solidarity and the crowd was with him, as he said, ""I'm going to stand strong with y'all.""

At the end of the show, Jussie lit up the stage with a call to action about being black, being gay and being proud. The crowd went absolutely wild.

As Jussie left the venue you can still see signs of the bruising he suffered on the streets of Chicago. TMZ broke the story, Jussie told cops he was walking home from a 2 AM Subway run when 2 men hurled homophobic and racial slurs at him, attacked him and screamed ""MAGA country."""

The 35-year-old actor and singer took the stage at The Troubadour in Los Angeles on Saturday night for a performance that was scheduled prior to the attack, and during his set, told fans he wanted to clear up certain details he said were wrongly reported.

“There’s a lot of stuff that’s been said about me that is absolutely not true,” Smollett said before speaking out about his injuries. “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken.”

“I went to the doctor immediately. Frank Gatson drove me, I was not hospitalized,” he added. “Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously.”

Smollett also stressed that he fought back against his attackers.

“And above all I fought the f**k back,” he concluded, before joking, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Earlier in the night, Smollett emotionally thanked his fans for coming to his show.

“I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to,” he said. ” And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all, and I had to be here tonight. It sounds powerful but I couldn’t let those mother f**kers win.”

As previously reported, a source told ET that Smollett was walking around Chicago early Tuesday morning when two men started yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, before repeatedly hitting him. The men then poured a substance on him (believed to be bleach), according to the source, and one of the attackers put a rope around his neck. Smollett was then taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

Smollett broke his silence about the attack on Friday with a statement.

“My body is strong, but my soul is stronger,” the statement read. “More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 per cent factual and consistent on every level,” he continued. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett’s family took the stage first, his brother Jojo speaking: “He’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night and he continues to fight.”

Added Jojo: “I wanted Jussie to sit this one out. I sincerely wanted him to stay out of the public [eye] until he heals. And after much debating, some arguing, many tears, my family and I realized that tonight is an important part of Jussie’s healing.”

Smollett then took the stage, addressing the audience: “I have so many words on my heart. The most important thing that I can say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all. I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let those motherf**kers win. l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me. So thank you, now… let’s do it.”

He spoke about the attack again at the encore.

Said Smollett: “Just because there has been a lot of stuff said about me that’s absolutely not true…I’m sure my lawyer’s sitting up there like. ‘No, Jussie, no! No! Shut the f**k up and sing.’”

He added: “There are just a couple of points I wanted to make pretty quick…four points….I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately. I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all: I fought the f**k back.”

Smollett closed the show by saying, “We are proud. We are gay.”

During the show Smollett also addressed Empire creator Lee Daniels and actor Wilson Cruz, Variety adds: “I promised myself I was not gonna cry tonight… Someone in the crowd that I want to recognize: Wilson Cruz is someone I identified with growing up. I stand on the backs of so many people — of the Lee Daniels and the Wilson. Cruzes — and I pray to God I make you all proud.”"

A defiant Jussie Smollett took the stage Saturday night at the Troubadour night club in Los Angeles and addressed a sold-out crowd, five days after being brutally attacked while walking home in Chicago.

“The most important thing I can say is thank you so much and I’m okay,” said Smollett with his face still swollen from the attack and sporting a visible bruise below one of his eyes. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I am going to [be] and I am going to stand strong with you all.”

For a moment, the Empire star seemed at a loss for words, but screams from the audience of “we love you Jussie” and “you are beautiful” encouraged him.

“I had to be here tonight,” he told the crowd. “It sounds powerful but I couldn’t let those motherfuckers ruin it. I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything else, and regardless what anyone else says I will only stand for love and I hope that y’all stand with me.”

And with that Smollett, 36, began an electrifying two-hour musical performance of songs from his recent album The Sum of My Music. Wearing black jeans, a loose white shirt, and white sneakers, Smollett, who plays the pop star Jamal Lyon on Fox’s Empire, enthralled his fans, his family, and members of the media who had packed themselves into almost every crevice of the club. This was Smollett’s first public appearance since he reported being assaulted.

The actor and musician told authorities he was attacked by two men as he returned to his apartment in Chicago on Tuesday morning. He said the men shouted racial epithets at him, beat him, poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. Police are still searching for the suspected assailants and are investigating the attack as a hate crime.

Actor Wilson Cruz, director Lee Daniels, cast and crew from his Fox hit show Empire, Smollett’s sister Journey, and Representative Maxine Waters of California, were just some of the 475 people who turned out on a rainy Los Angeles night to hear Smollett sing.

Before the show started, Smollett’s older brother Jake told the crowd that he had actually urged his brother to cancel this show.

“If I’m honest, as his big brother, I wanted Jussie to sit this one out,” he said. “I sincerely wanted him to stay out of the public until he heals. But after much debating, some arguing, and many tears, my family and I realized that tonight is an important part of Jussie’s healing. You see he has been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night and he continues to fight.”

Smollett’s fans were not surprised that the show went ahead as planned. Some had traveled as far away as Charlotte, North Carolina, to see him and hadn’t even hesitated getting on their flights confident the show would take place. But because of security concerns, Ticketmaster canceled Smollett’s planned meet and greet with fans before the show.

Hamilton actor Bryan Terrell Clark said, “Jussie is one of the most resilient people I know. One thing I knew for sure was that his love for people and his love for art was going to push him to do this show.

At the end of his captivating performance, Smollett said that he still needed to “set the record straight” over what happened. “I’m sure my lawyer is sitting up there like ‘no Jussie don’t, shut the fuck up and sing,’ but there are couple of points I want to make really clear. Four points. I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately but I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in LA and Chicago cleared me to perform. And above all, I fought the fuck back.”"

Fortunately, his doctors gave him the okay to perform. The actor and singer passionately spoke to the audience last night and even said, “I’m the gay 2Pac.”

The 35-year-old started by clearing up rumors that have been circulating in the media, “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken. I went to the director immediately. I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take care, obviously and, above all, I fought the f*ck back.” The crowd cheered as Jussie paused and then added, “I’m the gay 2pac,” according to the BBC.

He also said, “I’m not fully healed yet but I’m going to and I’m going to stand strong with y’all. I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let those motherf***ers win! I will always stand for love. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love.”

He continued, “Be as Black, be as proud, be as gay… Now is the time. Be Blacker, be gayer!” See the clip below:

Even though Smollett was a victim of assault, the Chicago Police Department apparently felt comfortable leaking information about the investigation and casting suspicion on the actor. First, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants, then hours later there were two “persons of interest.”

The Chicago Police Department has also reported two different descriptions of the suspects. TMZ wrote that Jussie never said the men were wearing MAGA hats, only that they screamed “MAGA country.”

On Tuesday, while walking to a Subway in Chicago, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor after he exited a restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Threatening letters directed at Smollett were reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago last week. The cutout letters said, “You will die black f**.” See below:

The Empire actor and R&B singer took to the stage in his first public appearance since two masked men attacked him and put a rope around his neck in Chicago last week.

The Chicago Sun Times reports that he told the crowd at the Troubadour in West Hollywood: “The most important thing I can say is thank you so much, and I’m OK.”

“I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

He added: “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win.

“I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around late last Tuesday evening.

He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Speaking on stage in West Hollywood, he said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked and confirmed he was not hospitalised — but immediately saw a doctor.

He also told the crowd: “And above all, I fought the (expletive) back. I’m the gay Tupac.”

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Jussie walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck.

In a statement released to Essence magazine after the attack the gay star said he was doing “OK”.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words,” he said.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 per cent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.”

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for the actor on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again”.

WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -- Jussie Smollett was blunt, emotional and defiantly determined Saturday night at a Southern California concert some urged him not to play, telling the crowd before singing a note that he had to go on with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

""The most important thing I can say is 'thank you so much, and I'm OK,"" said the ""Empire"" actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

""I'm not fully healed yet,"" said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, ""but I'm going to be, and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all.""

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn't do that.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those (expletives) win,"" he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. ""I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.""

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

""And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,"" he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, ""I'm the gay Tupac.""

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she's glad he did.

""It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,"" Davis said. ""He showed everyone in the room he was strong.""

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he's not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in ""Empire,"" the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, ""Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night's set, along with songs from ""Empire.""

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

""To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,"" Joel Smollett Jr. said. ""But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie's healing. He's been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.""

Smollett has released multiple statements standing by his initial account of the attack and clarifying that he is cooperating with authorities for the ongoing investigation.

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett performed at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California with his band Friday night in his first show since his reported attack earlier this week.

Smollett told the crowd Saturday he is ""not fully healed yet,"" after he was attacked by two men in what Chicago police described as ""possible racially charged assault and battery.""

After the attack, police said two men in ski masks approached an ""Empire"" cast member, yelling out ""racial and homophobic slurs."" The attackers then ""poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim"" and put a rope around his neck before leaving.

The 36-year-old actor, who identifies as gay and plays a gay character on the series, offered a message of hope before beginning his set to Saturday's crowd.

""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,"" Smollett said tearfully. ""We hope that you all stand with us.""

Alluding to reports that there were additional security concerns for Smollett's first public appearance since the attack, Smollett offered a defiant message.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,"" he said, prompting screams and cheers from about 400 people, according to the Associated Press. ""I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.""

Smollett also told the crowd he wanted to clarify reports of the attack, specifically that though he was bruised, none of his ribs were broken. The actor also said he went to the doctor but was not hospitalized.

""Above all, I fought the (expletive) back,"" he said to cheers, the Associated Press reported.

After a pause, Smollett laughed, ""I'm the gay Tupac.""

Smollett offered a similarly defiant tone in a statement provided to Essence on Friday, where he said he was OK but condemned the ""cowardly attacks.""

No arrests have been made in the investigation, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Police also identified two potential persons of interest who are seen in surveillance video near the area of the alleged attack.

""While the video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,"" Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department tweeted.

UPDATE (3/26/19), 11:35 AM EST: The charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett — over allegedly staging a racial attack against himself in Chicago on January 29 — have all been dropped, his Chicago-based attorney Ronald Safer confirms to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued the following statement (on March 26, 2019 at 1:15 PM EST) in wake of this development: “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”

ORIGINAL: The show must go on! Jussie Smollett is back in Los Angeles just days after his horrifying attack in Chicago, and despite the brutal incident, he was triumphant in concert on Saturday, February 2. The 35-year-old Empire star’s physical injuries from the incident, in which two men beat him while screaming homophobic and racist slurs, are still visible, but he was in good spirits as he performed. Jussie took time to address the attack onstage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, emotionally telling the audience, “I have to be here tonight. I couldn’t let those motherf*ckers win.”

“I will always stand for love,” Jussie continued. “I will never stand for anything other than it. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will always stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me.” The crowd – including California Congresswoman Maxine Waters, 80, according to the Daily Mail – erupted in cheers of support. Due to security reasons, Jussie canceled the meet-and-greet event that was supposed to accompany the performance, per the Daily Mail. Jussie then sang his heart out onstage, both solo and surrounded by back-up dancers.

This isn’t the first time that Jussie’s addressed his attack, though. The actor/singer released a statement that thanked his fans and fellow celebs for their support during his hospitalization. “Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” he told ESSENCE. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

The attack, which Chicago police are describing as a potential hate crime, occurred on January 29 while Jussie was leaving a Subway restaurant. According to the police report, Jussie was approached by two men who shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him, then proceeded to beat him. They also poured bleach on him, and wrapped a noose around his neck. Jussie was able to take himself to the hospital to get treatment. Police revealed later that they had persons of interest after viewing surveillance footage of the incident. The investigation is still ongoing."

The actor/ singer opened his concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood by telling the audience he had to play the show because he couldn't let his attackers ""win"".

""The most important thing I can say is just, keep it simple and that I'm okay,"" the visibly upset star shared. ""I'm not fully healed yet but I'm going to and... I'm going to stand strong with y'all.

""I had to be here tonight y'all. I couldn't let those motherf**kers win.""

The long-planned concert was Jussie's first public appearance since he was allegedly assaulted outside his apartment in Chicago on Tuesday (29Jan19). The Empire actor was reportedly beaten and had a noose tied around his neck by masked men.

Police officers are investigating the incident and have released images of two people they want to question.

According to TMZ, there were more security guards at the venue on Saturday night, while a meet and greet event that was due to take place before the show was cancelled by organisers ""for security reasons"".

Jussie thanked fans for their support in a statement on Friday and insisted he was helping police with their investigation into the alleged assault.

""My body is strong but my soul is stronger,"" he said. ""More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.

Nearly a week after claiming he was the victim of a homophobic and racist attack, Empire star Jussie Smollett made his first public appearance, standing tall and calling out the “motherf*ckers” whom police have still yet to arrest.

The actor and singer appeared at the Troubadour, the West Hollywood nightclub, where he performed to a sold-out crowd that, as per Deadline, included Empire co-creator Lee Daniels, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and members of his family.

“The most important thing that I can say is to keep it simple and say thank you and I’m OK,” Smollett told the crowd. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to and I’m going to stand strong with you all.

“I had to be here tonight,” Smollett added. “I couldn’t let those motherf*ckers win!”

The incident happened on January 29, when Smollett — known for playing the openly gay character Jamal Lyon on the popular Fox show — arrived in Chicago. According to his testimony, he was on the street near his apartment at 2 a.m. when two men shouted derogatory comments at him, began attacking him, poured an unknown chemical substance over him, and put a noose around his neck. They then fled the scene.

Smollett reported the incident to the police. He was treated at Northwestern Hospital but was not hospitalized. Police scanned over surveillance footage, finally seeking two “persons of interest” in what Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi dubbed an “assault and battery case.” Smollet himself has called it an act of “domestic terrorism.”

Smollett broke his silence on Friday, saying that “despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

The 35-year-old took the stage at The Troubadour in Los Angeles on Saturday night for a performance that was scheduled prior to the attack, and during his set, told fans he wanted to clear up certain details he said were wrongly reported.

“There’s a lot of stuff that’s been said about me that is absolutely not true,” Smollett said before speaking out about his injuries. “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken.”

“I went to the doctor immediately. Frank Gatson drove me, I was not hospitalized,” he added. “Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously.”

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in the statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett was attacked early Tuesday morning in what Chicago police called a possible hate crime.

The 36-year-old actor was exiting a restaurant in the 300 block of East North Water Street when two suspects began yelling racial and homophobic slurs toward him. They then proceeded to attack Smollett, punching him before pouring an unknown chemical substance over him, police said. At some point during the attack, one of the suspects wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck.

The singer also stressed that he fought back against his attackers.

“And above all I fought the fuck back,” he concluded, before joking, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

He added: “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win.

“I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around late last Tuesday evening.

He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Speaking on stage in West Hollywood, he said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked and confirmed he was not hospitalised — but immediately saw a doctor.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Jussie walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck.

In a statement released to Essence magazine after the attack the gay star said he was doing “OK”.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.”

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for the actor on social media.

Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again”.

“I will always stand for love,” he said. “I will only stand for love.”

Police have released surveillance footage of “potential persons of interest” in the incident. The actor released a statement Friday saying he has been ""100% truthful"" with law enforcement authorities after police said he refused to turn over phone records from around the time of the attack.

Smollett spoke briefly about the attack near the end of his performance, jokingly calling himself “the gay Tupac” in saying that he fought his attackers, according to the AP.

Ellis often speaks about the film industry in a way that doesn’t endear him to the Hollywood left. In 2012, he apologized to “Hurt Locker” director Kathryn Bigelow for suggesting that she had only won Oscars because she was “a hot woman.” He has also expressed amusement at widespread Hollywood revulsion toward President Trump, though he has stressed that he is not a Trump fan.

In the latest, 100th episode of his “B.E.E. Podcast,” available only to paid subscribers, Ellis mused: “No superhero movie has ever gotten a Best Picture nomination. But believe me, Disney is doing everything in its power to make sure this happens. Even though there is no one out here in La La Land I’ve met who thinks ‘Black Panther’ is that good as a movie. Yet, as a piece of representation, they are supporting it.”



Alex Jones weighs in on the evidence surrounding an alleged attack that was reported in Chicago where an actor from the FOX television show “Empire,” Jussie Smollett, is said to have been brutally beaten by two men in ski masks who simultaneously taunted him with both racist and anti-gay slurs. After his initial police report, the actor added that the attackers yelled, “…this is MAGA country…”

Ellis recorded the podcast on Jan. 17, before the Oscar nominations were announced, and correctly guessed that “Black Panther” would score a Best Picture nomination. But he asked: “Does it really deserve one?”

“The entertainment press and the studio is selling the notion that ‘Black Panther’ is a grand piece of cinematic art that cannot be ignored. And this notion is being shoved down our throats and we can only smile in disbelief. Or perhaps understand that this is just the moment we’re trapped in. A joke, a hoax. It’s all fake news, folks,” Ellis said.

Taking the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, he fought back tears as he said, “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the [expletives] win.”

“I have so many words on my heart,” the actor/singer said, addressing the 400-capacity club after embracing members of his family. “The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all… l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me. So now… let’s do it.”

Before his encore, Smollett again addressed the crowd at length.

“Just because there has been a lot ot stuff said about me that’s absolutely not true…” he began, seemingly addressing pockets of skepticism on social media about his account of the attack. He paused to cast a glance at the balcony: “I’m sure my lawyer’s sitting up there like. ‘No, Jussie, no! No! Shut the f– up and sing.’” He moved on to “four points” he said he wanted to address and clarify: “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediatelyâ ¦ I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform; they said to take care, obviously. And above all: I fought the f– back.”

After the cheers died down, he roused the crowd again by jokingly announcing: “I’m the gay Tupac! So now, we can do our encore.”

His final words before exiting the stage: “We are proud. We are gay.”

Those in attendance at the Troubadour included Rep. Maxine Waters, filmmaker Lee Daniels and actor Wilson Cruz.

He addressed the latter two near the end of the show, saying, “I promised myself I was not gonna cry tonight… Someone in the crowd that I want to recognize: Wilson Cruz is someone I identified with growing up. I stand on the backs of so many people — of the Lee Daniels and the Wilson. Cruzes — and I pray to God I make you all proud.”

Smollett’s brother, Jojo, introduced him, saying, “There’s been an outpouring of love and support â ¦ There’s also been (inflammatory) stories spread that have hurt him deeply,” he added. “I sincerely wanted him to stay out of the public until he healed. And after much debate, some arguing and many tears, my family and I have realized that tonight is an important part of his healing. You see, he’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night and he continues to fight. Jussie is a true artist every time he breathes. But above all else, he is the epitome of love.”

Later, in introducing a song about his boyfriend, Smollett said, “Over these last four days, my man… Everybody should be blessed enough to have a love like that. But love will f– you up.” Another song intro had him pointing out “a lot of my ‘Empire‘ family here. Happy to bring to life my character Jamal Lyon. This song, it kind of has a new meaning for me,” he said, making a segue into “Heaven.”

Last week, Smollett issued a statement to Essence that read: “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. … Soon I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.”

Smollett said he was on the phone with his manager Brandon Moore when the attack happened. The two are cooperating with authorities as the investigate the incident as a possible hate crime. Smollett plays an openly gay character on the Fox series “Empire.”

According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, Smollett told them was beaten by two men who approached him by yelling out “racial and homophobic slurs” at approximately 2 a.m. on Tuesday morning in the 300 block of E. North Water St. They proceeded to assault Smollett and “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him. The two men are also said to have put a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing on foot. Smollett then transported himself to an area hospital after speaking with police.

Will the political arm of the state’s largest LGBTQ civil rights group embrace one of their own?

Or punt?

OPINION

The competition for Chicago’s LGBTQ vote is fierce. That’s why dozens of politicians donned their tuxedos and gold lamé for Saturday night’s sold-out Equality Illinois fundraiser.

More than 1,500 guests and 50 elected officials packed the Hilton Chicago ballroom. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker was a featured speaker.

A highlight of the swanky affair is the parade of politicians who strut across the stage under glittering lights to wave, blow kisses and show their love for the LGBTQ vote.

The Chicago Department of Public Health reports that 146,000 LGBTQ adults live in Chicago — 7.5 percent of the city’s adult population.

After the lights go off, the Equality Illinois Political Action Committee will consider an endorsement in the 2019 mayoral race.

The endorsement is a high-profile stamp of approval in the community.

The PAC board will meet in early February, said Mike Ziri, director of public policy at Equality Illinois. They will consider the candidates’ responses to a questionnaire on LGBTQ issues and their “past record of what have you done in office, how have you taken a stand in the community,” he said.

Many of the 14 mayoral aspirants offer solid track records. One, Lori Lightfoot, is a lesbian, prominent attorney and former Chicago Police Board president.

In 2011 and 2015, Mayor Rahm Emanuel handily won the PAC endorsement. In 2015, the PAC cited Emanuel’s support for same-sex marriage and his efforts to secure funding for affordable housing, and enhance access to health care and other services for LGBTQ people.

Insurgent challenger Jesus “Chuy” Garcia made an aggressive pitch, touting his record as a gay rights champion since his City Council days in the 1980s. Back then, a rare and dicey stance for a Latino politician.

But the Equality Illinois PAC went with Emanuel in the first electoral round, before Garcia pushed the mayor into a runoff.

Last December, the PAC endorsed all five of Chicago’s openly LGBTQ aldermen. “Their leadership demonstrates to us that representation matters at all levels of government,” John Litchfield, chair of the Equality Illinois PAC said in a press release.

And the top job at City Hall?

The Equality Illinois PAC “may endorse multiple candidates, one candidate, or no candidate,” Ziri wrote in an email.

The PAC could help make history. Lightfoot talks often on the stump about her sexual orientation and how it influences her passion for social justice. She touts endorsements from LPAC and the Victory Fund, national organizations that support LGBT candidates. She was the first mayoral candidate to release a policy platform in LGBTQ issues, according to her campaign. And she pledges, “the LGBTQ+ community will always be a priority for my administration.”

Challenges lie ahead. The Trump administration has attacked LGBTQ rights and banned transgender people from serving in the military. Anti-gay hate crimes are still far too common, like last week’s attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago.

Some political players are reluctant to endorse until they see the lineup for the April 2 mayoral runoff. The race is too crowded, they calculate. Why alienate the next mayor by backing the wrong horse?

Ziri can’t say when the board will decide.

Will the Equality Illinois PAC step hard on the gas, or give Lori the lightfoot?

I couldn't let those (expletives) win,"" he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. ""I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.""His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.""And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,"" he said to cheers.Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, ""I'm the gay Tupac.""Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she's glad he did.""It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,"" Davis said. ""He showed everyone in the room he was strong.""Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he's not being genuine.Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in ""Empire,"" the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.Last year he released a solo album, ""Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night's set, along with songs from ""Empire.""He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.""To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,"" Joel Smollett Jr. said. ""But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie's healing. He's been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.""-----"

Smollett told police he was verbally and physically assaulted in downtown Chicago in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 while walking home from a Subway restaurant. He said two masked men punched him, made homophobic and racial slurs, poured an unknown liquid substance on him and put a rope around his neck.

""I'm not fully healed yet, but I'm going to,"" he told a crowd of about 400 people on Saturday, speaking for the first time in public and in person about the incident. ""And I'm going to stand strong with y'all.""

Fans wait in downpour

The singer-actor, 36, performed at the Troubadour club in West Hollywood. More than 100 fans lined up around the building hours before the doors opened, waiting in the pouring rain.

""Powering through whatever has happened and really making it less about himself and more about what's going on in our society, I think, is something I'm definitely down to hear so that's why I came,"" said Jael Allen, who says she bought tickets after hearing about the attack.

The show sold out shortly after news of Smollett's ordeal was publicized.

""To have somebody of that status and this situation happen to them, it was really shocking,"" said Mia Darby, 21. ""But it wasn't a surprise because a lot of this stuff has been going on for a long time.""

Authorities so far have not been able to find video of the attack, despite a sophisticated system of surveillance cameras around the city. They have, however, obtained images of people they'd like to question and say Smollett has been co-operative with the investigation.

Empire creator in audience

The TV star, who plays R&B singer Jamal Lyon on Empire, has received support and messages online from co-stars, celebrities and politicians. Empire co-creator Lee Daniels and actor Wilson Cruz, known for his groundbreaking role on My So-Called Life, were among those in the audience Smollett acknowledged while on stage.

Some of the songs Smollett performed were from the Empire soundtrack, including the popular track Heavy, which the singer said now has new meaning. The song includes lyrics such as ""Daddy raised a soldier, whether he knew it or not"" and ""I refuse to let my people down.""

""I had to be here tonight,"" he told the audience. ""It sounds proud but I couldn't let those motherf---ers win.""

Before the show, Smollett's siblings took the stage and said they were uncertain whether their brother should perform so soon after the ""traumatic experience."" Smollett's brother, Jojo, said there have been many ""false, undercutting stories,"" referring to questions being raised on social media about the truthfulness of the attack.

""I sincerely wanted him to stay out of the public until he healed,"" said Jojo Smollett, referring to his brother. ""After much debate, some arguing and many tears, my family and I have realized that tonight is an important part of his healing."""

Ellen Page spoke about the heartbreaking impact that the Trump administration has had on the LGBTQ community

This week, Empire star Jussie Smollett said that he was attacked by two men in Chicago, who beat him, yelled homophobic and racial slurs, threw a chemical substance on him, and put a rope around his neck. This disgusting, repulsive act of violence is a symptom of the Trump administration and their hateful ideology, as Ellen Page explained during a heartbreaking speech on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.

The actress broke down exactly how damaging Donald Trump and Mike Pence have been to the LGBTQ community – and many took to Twitter to express gratitude for speaking such an important truth.

Page, who appeared on Colbert to discuss her new Netflix show The Umbrella Academy, said that she was feeling “really fired up.” She explained that she was frustrated that the media wasn’t explicitly categorizing Smollett’s attack as a hate crime and then dug into Vice President Mike Pence’s deplorable views on the LGBTQ community.

“The Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love [I have] with my wife,” she said. “He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.”

She then asked everyone to connect the dots between what happened to Smollett and the current administration’s stand on LGBTQ people.

“If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering…what do you think is going to happen?” Page said. “Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves. People are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I’m lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.”

People across Twitter applauded Page for eloquently, thoughtfully, and passionately standing up for the LGBTQ community and expressing the awful, dangerous trickle down consequences of a bigoted government.

Thank you for demonstrating the courage to publicly speak our truth, and with such authority and conviction, @EllenPage. https://t.co/0ZMDxJaKcO — Dustin Lance Black (@DLanceBlack) February 1, 2019

I don’t care if you’re straight, gay, bi, trans, who you sleep with or who you don’t sleep with. You need to watch this and you need to listen. Thank you, @EllenPage for using your voice. https://t.co/1RvL9GvfJj — Ida Skibenes ❄️ (@ida_skibenes) February 1, 2019

Not much to say except thank you @EllenPage. https://t.co/7ecU5EwhVI — Antoni Porowski (@antoni) February 1, 2019

Love this lady. She walks the walk. Thank you Ms Page. https://t.co/bIAWsGcgNC — Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) February 1, 2019

This is the first of many times that Page has passionately and powerfully spoken out in support of the LGBTQ community. In 2014, the actress came out at the Human Rights Campaign’s Time to Thrive conference, which benefited LGBTQ youth.

“I’m here today because I am gay and because maybe I can make a difference, to help others have an easier and more hopeful time,” she said in her speech. “Regardless, for me, I feel a personal obligation and a social responsibility.” She added that she was tired of lying about her sexual orientation.

“I suffered for years because I was scared to be out,” Page said. “My spirit suffered, my mental health suffered and my relationships suffered. And I’m standing here today, with all of you, on the other side of all that pain.”

So, so much applause to Page for speaking her truth, standing up for people who are suffering, and calling out bigoted politicians. We’re standing in solidarity with you."

Empire actor Jussie Smollett's performed for the first time since his attack telling fans he'll always stand for love.

On stage, before singing, he fought back tears as he told fans: ""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I can't let [them] win.""

Police are searching for two men who punched him, poured a ""chemical substance"" over him and put a rope around his neck in a suspected racist and homophobic attack.

""The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I'm okay. I'm not fully healed yet, but I'm going to.""

The concert had been planned for a long time before the incident. His family and others had urged him to cancel the show while he recovers and police investigate.

But Jussie said he couldn't do that.

""I'm gonna stand strong with y'all. l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that,"" said the openly gay actor.

""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me. So now, let's do it.""

Police are investigating whether he was the victim of a hate crime.

Jussie told police the two men - who attacked him in Chicago earlier this week - made reference to ""MAGA"" (Make America Great Again).

The slogan was used by Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential campaign.

While Jussie's had a huge amount of support, others have questioned his version of what happened.

He told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

""Just because there has been a lot of stuff said about me that's absolutely not true,"" he said.

He glanced at the balcony: ""I'm sure my lawyer's sitting up there like. 'No, Jussie, no.'""

""I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken,"" he said referring to some notes he'd brought on stage.

""I went to the doctor immediately. I was not hospitalised.

""Both my doctors in LA and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously.

""And above all, I fought them back,"" he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said: ""I'm the gay Tupac.""

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Jussie walking home with the rope around his neck.

Before leaving the stage the artist said: ""We are proud. We are gay.""

(AP) - Jussie Smollett was blunt, emotional and defiantly determined Saturday night at a Southern California concert some urged him not to play, telling the crowd before singing a note that he had to go on with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

""The most important thing I can say is 'thank you so much, and I'm OK,"" said the ""Empire"" actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

""I'm not fully healed yet,"" said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, ""but I'm going to be, and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all.""

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn't do that.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those (expletives) win,"" he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. ""I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.""

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

""And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,"" he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, ""I'm the gay Tupac.""

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she's glad he did.

""It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,"" Davis said. ""He showed everyone in the room he was strong.""

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he's not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in ""Empire,"" the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, ""Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night's set, along with songs from ""Empire.""

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

""To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,"" Joel Smollett Jr. said. ""But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie's healing. He's been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.""

We'd been sailing for six days along Greenland's west coast on an expedition cruise when Thule Air Base slowly hove into view, the USA's northernmost military outpost that lays 1,524km (950 miles) from the North Pole.

A jumble of aircraft hangers and big vehicles slowly came into sight against the barren landscape and I stood out on deck in a bid to get a better view of the eerily remote command centre.

We weren't allowed on the base but we were going to dock next door, at a spot where the Inuit community living there were forced to leave in 1953 when the U.S. forces landed when the nuclear arms race kicked off. Today, military staff holiday at the site, using the old Greenlandic hunting shacks as weekend cottages.

An aerial view of Thule Air Base in winter, which is the United States Air Force's northernmost base. It's located 1,118km (695 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, and 1,524km (950 miles) south of the North Pole on the northwest side of Greenland

MailOnline Travel dropped anchor just outside the air base with the aircraft hangers and military vehicles visible close by

U.S. personnel only spend one year at Thule Air Base. On the official United States Air Force website Lt. Col. Bob Pavelko says of Thule: 'It looks like the moonscape here. It has an incredible, rugged beauty of its own'

I was told during a lecture about Thule that more than 100 inhabitants were forcibly relocated and given days to leave after the Danish authorities (Greenland was ruled by the Danish until 1979) struck up a deal allowing America to set up a top-secret airbase. The U.S. government established an anti-aircraft missile artillery unit, but no nuclear warheads were ever permitted.

The site was strategically selected because of its location between Moscow and Washington D.C.

The unexpected arrival of American soldiers is said to have caused great distress to the Inuit community, as they had to scramble to find a new spot of land.

They spent around seven months living in tents in frigid temperatures with some succumbing to the bitter cold.

Eventually, they found a spot 65 miles away with similar hunting opportunities and they named the settlement New Thule or Qaanaaq.

Walking around 'old Thule', the Innuit's abandoned village had a haunting feel. It was a mixture of renovated wooden homes now used by air base personnel for weekend breaks and completely abandoned turf huts.

There is a small cemetery at Thule with graves of the former Inuit residents marked with wooden crosses

It was a sunny day but there was a sharp breeze blowing with the hammering of workmen piercing the silence.

I walked past one worker who was giving one of the old shelters a fresh lick of paint, while another hammered a window frame into place.

After visiting a trapper's hut, which has been turned into a explorer-themed museum, I came across a small cemetery with wonky weather-beaten wooden crosses and a rusty children's play-frame. One swing was missing while the other hung limply.

I walked across a barren bank across the way from Thule Air Base and down to the water's edge.

At one spot I saw a U.S. ten-pin bowling skittle had been used for target practice with bullet holes permeating its body and another had its shattered wooden innards on display.

An old turf hut at Thule, once home to an Inuit family. They were simple and easy to construct

Up until the mid-1950s the turf hut was the most common type of dwelling, as they were proved to be very robust and well insulated

A military vehicle drove past me, whipping a spray of dust into the air, and drove up a hill that had a red sign signalling it was off-limits to visitors.

After walking along the rock-strewn beach where lumps of ice bobbed close to shore, I came across a Greenlandic turf hut subsiding into the boggy ground.

For thousands of years the Inuit lived in turf huts that were simple and easy to construct, necessary because the weather and seasons changed so quickly and dramatically.

Up until the mid-1950s the turf hut was the most common type of dwelling, as they were proved to be very robust and well insulated.

A typical turf hut was low, square and its walls were made of large stones and turf and the roof was supported by wooden beams made of driftwood. The dwellings were typically situated close to the sea so that the hunters could easily get to their kayaks and set off on seal hunts.

All the turf huts I saw at Thule had long been abandoned and they looked in a sorry state with rotting interiors and missing roofs.

The Thule Air Base site was strategically selected because of its location between Moscow and Washington D.C.

Inside one I accidentally kicked a Smirnoff vodka bottle - a sign that the place is now used as a drinking hangout instead of a spot for huddling up with the family.

After spending a couple of hours wandering around Thule, I ventured back to the ship.

U.S. personnel only spend one year at Thule Air Base and after visiting the otherworldly spot, it's understandable that the remoteness would be difficult to hack for any longer.

However, it is a place that appears to leave quite an impression on those who visit.

On the official United States Air Force website Lt. Col. Bob Pavelko says of Thule: 'It looks like the moonscape here. It has an incredible, rugged beauty of its own.'

While Staff Sgt. Alisha Miles adds: 'Not many people can say they've been this far north or to Greenland. You've got to try it once. I'd rather be here than in Korea.'"

Parental guidance is strongly advised.

And once again, toxic masculinity rears its ugly, unwelcome, and frighteningly dangerous head. Or should that be its inadequate, seething, and pitifully fragile ego?

Only a man—in this case, two men—so insecure, so lacking in empathy, so festering in a deep and pointless hatred that unfortunately can be lethal, can be so offended by a Black gay man who just happens to be on a hit TV show playing a Black gay man, that they beat him up, throw bleach on him, and put a rope around his neck while shouting racist and homophobic slurs. Some media platforms say the attackers allegedly cried out, “This is MAGA country!”

Only a man so angry, so full of pity for himself, so unable to get laid, can be so personally aggrieved that no woman wants to go out with him, and that he’s still a virgin that he plans a mass shooting in Utah and announces it on social media, threatening to kill “as many girls as I see.”

Geez, what f*cking losers all these pathetic—and almost inevitably White—men are. It would be so risible if they weren’t walking killing machines capable of fatally harming and assaulting the people they’ve somehow decided are responsible for their own misery—women, Blacks, gays, transgenders—instead of their own loathsome selves.

I am so done with the mainstream media constantly throwing these bigoted, toxic white males softballs, trying to analyze why they feel so much rage, why they feel society has failed them. Oh, poor White mass shooter, such a troubled child since his elementary years, no friends, both parents working… Oh poor White thugs in their MAGA hats, so tough-talking on the outside but so fragile on the inside, so full of resentment that economic opportunities have bypassed them in favor of people of color… Oh poor ignorant White loser, never had a girlfriend, weighed down by the expectations of society, unable to adjust to a world he no longer recognizes…

Yes, these men may be troubled. But they also get a pass somehow by virtue of White privilege. A huge part of their problem is that they refuse to see that they are the problem. The world is changing but they won’t or can’t evolve in order to adapt to the changes and survive. They feel their privilege is being eroded, and the “others” they imagine are usurping that privilege from them do not deserve it. So they cling to the belief that the world revolves around them and everyone else must adapt—or die, as some do, literally, eventually, at their hands. Moreover, they seek comfort in their own echo chamber, populated by like-minded people, where the warped sound of their hate and rage bounces against the walls they’ve built around themselves.

We should all stop p*ssyfooting and call these men out for what they really are. Racists. Bigots. Terrorists. Toxic. They perpetrate acts of hate and violence, and should be prosecuted and punished for what in fact amount to crimes.

Jussie Smollett’s attackers are criminals. Their racism and their homophobia are inseparable from their criminal natures, and it’s a relief to know that video footage has surfaced of their heinous actions, and they are likely to be prosecuted in Chicago for hate crimes.

No, really, help me understand: What is so threatening about a gay Black man? Or a gay man? Or a Black man for that matter? No doubt these God-fearing men wanted to teach Smollett a “lesson” for his open embrace of a “perverse” lifestyle, preferring so suck d*ck instead of eat p*ssy. So they beat him up because that’s what “real” men do—they display their power through violence. No doubt these “superior” White men wanted to put him in his place and tied a noose around him to send the clear message that he had no right to aspire to be anything other than the “slave” that he was.

If you ask me, it’s pretty obvious that these men hated the fact that Smollett was undoubtedly richer, more successful, more stylish, more educated, better brought up, and more famous than they could ever hope to be. And that he was probably getting laid more often, albeit by other men, but who cares? Action is action. And I wouldn’t be surprised if they were jealous of his Black d*ck, which in all probability, if the myth holds true, was bigger than theirs.

Why do toxic men think that beating up gay men is an assertion of their virility? On the contrary, it exposes them for what they are: insecure cowards whose sense of masculinity is powered by rage and not kindness or compassion or intelligence.

And here comes another man who uses social media to beat up a woman, slut-shaming her for what she was wearing to work. Oh the poor Alabama man—Republican, of course—so outraged, so triggered by the boots and fitted short dress Democratic Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema wore to Congress the other day that he sputtered about on Facebook, saying she was “inappropriately dressed.”

Granted, what Sinema wore might not have been my personal choice, but so f*cking what? In fact, bravo to Sinema for not giving a sh*t about what old fusty White men think. She’s never hidden the fact that she’s bisexual and atheist; good on her for not allowing herself to be dictated to by men who are terrified about losing the privilege they’ve enjoyed and abused all these decades. And why, with a president as spectacularly ignorant and bigoted as Donald Trump do such men even make an issue out of a woman’s outfit? Was she immodestly exposed, cleavage on display? No. Though her dress was short, did they reveal her butt for all to see? No. Did her over-the-knee boots go beyond the knees and cover practically her thighs? Yes. So how much of her body was revealed? Very little, actually.

So what was Alabama State Auditor Jim Zeigler’s problem? That she didn’t wear a dull gray pinstripe suit like all the other men? Or that he couldn’t wear that to work?

Just do a Google image search of Jim Zeigler and his many wacky outfits. Maybe he’s been spending too much time in the closet.

This is his true, raw emotions and it deserves to be reported on uncensored.)

West Hollywood - Before singing a note, Jussie Smollett took the stage and fought back tears as he told the crowd that he had to go on with a Southern California concert because he couldn't let his attackers win.

""The most important thing I can say is 'thank you so much, and I'm OK,"" said the Empire actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubador in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had attacked him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

""I'm not fully healed yet,"" said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, ""but I'm going to be, and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all.""

The concert had been planned long before the incident. Family members and others had urged Smollett to cancel the show while he recovers and police investigate.

But Smollett said he couldn't do that.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those motherfuckers win,"" he said to screams and cheers from the packed room. ""I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.""

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans.

Smollett kept the tone lighter through a celebratory hour-long set.

He addressed the attack again directly only toward the end of his hour-slong set.

He told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things. He was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

'I FOUGHT THE FUCK BACK'

""And above all, I fought the fuck back,"" he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said emphatically, ""I'm the gay Tupac.""

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early on Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" the statement said.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he's not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in ""Empire,"" the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season.

He plays one of three brothers on the show, the openly gay Jamal Lyon. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in ""Empire,"" the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, ""Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night's set, along with songs from ""Empire.""

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

""To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,"" Joel Smollett Jr. said. ""But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie's healing. He's been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight."""

Just four days after Empire actor and singer Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago while the assailants hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, according to the report, he made a triumphant return to the stage at Los Angeles’s famed Troubadour on Saturday.

“I’m not fully healed yet but I’m going to and I’m going to stand strong with y’all. I had to be here tonight,” Smollett said to a packed house following an introduction by his siblings. “I couldn’t let those motherfuckers win!

“I will always stand for love. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,” Smollett said.

There were those (including his family) who wondered if Smollett should keep his performance date at the Troubadour following the heinous crime he endured on Monday during which the assailants allegedly doused him with a chemical, tied a noose around his neck, and shouted racist and homophobic epithets. But, not only did he show up, he turned out a powerful performance to an enthusiastic crowd, many of whom stood in hours in the rain to see him.

The evening began with an a capella number from the group June’s Diary before members of the performing Smollett family took to the stage with a statement about the attack on their brother. His eldest brother Joel Smollett Jr. read the following:

“As you know, my brother Jussie, not even a week ago, survived a traumatic experience, which no one should ever have to go through. Since then, there’s been an outpouring of love and support that has truly humbled our family. There has also been a bevy of false, undercutting stories that have hurt him deeply. If I’m honest, as his big brother, I wanted Jussie to sit this one out. I sincerely wanted to stay out of the public until he heals. But then after much debating, some arguing, many tears, my family and I realized that tonight is an important part of Jussie’s healing.”

“Be as black, be as proud, be as gay… Now is the time,” Smollett proclaimed later in the evening to a packed, cheering crowd that included California Congresswoman Maxine Waters. “Be blacker. Be gayer!”

During his set, Smollett shouted out to his boyfriend calling him his “man"" and thanking him for standing strong during the emotional tribulations of the past week.

Toward the end of his lively set that included the songs “Heavy” and “Freedom,” Smollett acknowledged actor Wilson Cruz in the crowd, explaining that Cruz, who played the gay character Ricky on the beloved ‘90s show My So-Called Life, was the first character Smollett had ever seen on TV that resembled him in some way.

Smollett went on to praise other trailblazing queer men of color including Lee Daniels, Langston Hughes, and James Baldwin.

Before his encore, Smollett stepped out onto the stage and said there were four points he wanted to make about the attack.

""I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken. I went to the director immediately. I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take care, obviously,"" Smollett said. ""And above all, I fought the fuck back.”

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett took the stage Saturday in his first performance since he reported being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

Speaking out about the reported assault in an appearance at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, the actor delivered a message of hope and resilience.

“I’m not fully healed yet, but... I’m going to stand strong with you all,” he told the crowd as it erupted in cheers.

According to police, Smollett told them he was accosted last Tuesday in Chicago by two masked men shouting homophobic and racial slurs. He was beaten and doused in what was likely bleach. He also said the assailants wrapped a rope around his neck.

In a subsequent interview with authorities, Smollett, who is black and gay, said the perps yelled “MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” catchphrase.

Toward the end of his show, Smollett took a moment to clarify details on the attack, noting that he had suffered bruises but no broken ribs and had gone to a doctor promptly. He also said he was not hospitalized and that his physicians in Los Angeles and Chicago had given him the green light to perform.

“And above all, I fought the fuck back,” he added, receiving applause.

“The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the “Empire” actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubador in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had attacked him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The concert had been planned long before the incident. Family members and others had urged Smollett to cancel the show while he recovers and police investigate.

But Smollett said he couldn’t do that.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,” he said to screams and cheers from the packed room. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans.

Smollett kept the tone lighter through a celebratory hour-long set.

He addressed the attack again directly only toward the end of his hour-slong set.

He told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things. He was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

“And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,” he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said emphatically, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

He plays one of three brothers on the show, the openly gay Jamal Lyon. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, “Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night’s set. NVG

It sounds like Liam Payne and Naomi Campbell’s reported romance is hotting up as a source claims the former One Direction singer is ‘head over heels’ for the model.

The British stars were first romantically linked in December during a trip to Ghana, and they were most recently spotted hanging out together last week at Davido’s concert at London’s O2 Arena.

While their alleged romance still appears to be in the early stages, an insider claims Liam, 25, and Naomi, 48, couldn’t be more smitten with each other.

The source told The Sun on Sunday: ‘He can’t believe his luck.

‘Liam thinks she’s amazing and beautiful, and has said their intimate time together has been mind-blowing.’

Another insider added: ‘Liam has been seeing Naomi for a while. He’s mad keen on her. He seems head over heels. They are definitely an item and have been seeing a lot of each other.’

What is going on??? (Picture: Instagram/@naomi/@liampayne)

According to the insider, the rumoured new couple are also enjoying themselves in the bedroom with their alleged ‘intimate’ time described as ‘mind-blowing’.

Wowza.

The source said: ‘Liam thinks she’s amazing and beautiful, and has said their intimate time together has been mind-blowing. He seems really into her and acting like he can’t believe his luck.

‘I had seen some internet rumours but I was astounded when I found out it was a proper relationship. He obviously likes a beautiful older woman.’

Of course, Liam’s last high-profile relationship was with The Greatest Dancer judge Cheryl, whom he shares one-year-old son Bear. However, the couple split in July 2018 after more than two years together.

WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -- Jussie Smollett was blunt, emotional and defiantly determined Saturday night at a Southern California concert some urged him not to play, telling the crowd before singing a note that he had to go on with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

""The most important thing I can say is 'thank you so much, and I'm OK,"" said the ""Empire"" actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

""I'm not fully healed yet,"" said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, ""but I'm going to be, and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all.""

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn't do that.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those (expletives) win,"" he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. ""I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.""

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

""And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,"" he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, ""I'm the gay Tupac.""

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she's glad he did.

""It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,"" Davis said. ""He showed everyone in the room he was strong.""

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

""To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,"" Joel Smollett Jr. said. ""But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie's healing. He's been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.""

Empire actor Jussie Smollett bravely returned to the public eye last night for the first time since he was brutally attacked earlier in the week.

The 35-year-old actor performed at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on Saturday night and delivered an emotional message of defiance against his attackers, who set upon him in the early hours of Tuesday morning in Chicago.

Jussie was introduced to the stage by his brother, Joel Smollett Jr, who described him as a ‘fighter’ and said the performance would be like therapy for his sibling.

Arriving on-stage to much applause, Jussie stated: ‘I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the motherfuckers win.

The TV star continued: ‘The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to.

‘And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all… l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me. So now… let’s do it.’

At one point during the show, Jussie took the opportunity to shut down social media rumours that details of his attack may have been fabricated.

Addressing the speculation, he said: ‘Just because there has been a lot of stuff said about me that’s absolutely not true… I’m sure my lawyer’s sitting up there like. ‘No, Jussie, no! No! Shut the fuck up and sing.’”

Jussie then went on to clarify the details of his injuries after initial reports said he suffered cracked ribs and had bleach thrown on him during the attack.

The actor stated: ‘I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately… I was not hospitalised. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all: I fought the fuck back.”

Jussie then ended the show by telling the audience: ‘We are proud. We are gay.’

Supporting the singer from the audience were Empire creator Lee Daniels and Rep. Maxine Waters.

Last week, Chicago Police Department confirmed they were investigating the attack as a ‘possible hate crime’ after the thugs allegedly hurled racial and homophobic slurs at Jussie.

Before singing a note, Jussie Smollett took the stage and fought back tears as he told the crowd that he had to go on with a Southern California concert because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

“The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the Empire actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubador in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had attacked him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The concert had been planned long before the incident. Family members and others had urged Smollett to cancel the show while he recovers and police investigate.

But Smollett said he couldn’t do that.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,” he said to screams and cheers from the packed room. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans.

Smollett kept the tone lighter through a celebratory hour-long set.

He addressed the attack again directly only toward the end of his hour-long set.

He told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things. He was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

“And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,” he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said emphatically, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” the statement said.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he’s not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in Empire, the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season.

He plays one of three brothers on the show, the openly gay Jamal Lyon. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night’s set.

WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -- Jussie Smollett was blunt, emotional and defiantly determined Saturday night at a Southern California concert some urged him not to play, telling the crowd before singing a note that he had to go on with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

""The most important thing I can say is 'thank you so much, and I'm OK,"" said the ""Empire"" actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

""I'm not fully healed yet,"" said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, ""but I'm going to be, and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all.""

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn't do that.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those (expletives) win,"" he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. ""I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.""

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

""And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,"" he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, ""I'm the gay Tupac.""

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she's glad he did.

""It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,"" Davis said. ""He showed everyone in the room he was strong.""

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been ""consistent on every level"" with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he's not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in ""Empire,"" the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, ""Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night's set, along with songs from ""Empire.""

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

""To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,"" Joel Smollett Jr. said. ""But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie's healing. He's been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.""

The Empire actor performed for a 400-person crowd at a club this weekend, and opened up about the attack.

According to a report by Variety, Jussie Smollett is mad and driven. The actor and singer spoke out about his attack after he was jumped by two men wearing ski masks in Chicago earlier this week.

Smollett claims that he had to do the club performance, because he couldn’t “let the motherf***ers win” by canceling the show.

“I have so many words on my heart. The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all… l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me. So now… let’s do it,” Jussie told the crowd.

The actor then went on to reveal that he was sure that his lawyer wouldn’t be happy about him talking about the incident, but he wanted to set some of the false rumors straight.

Jussie Smollett then revealed to fans that his ribs were bruised following the attack, but not broken as some rumors suggested. He says he went to the doctor following the attack, but was not hospitalized, and then revealed that he wouldn’t stand for the terrible situation that he was put in by his attackers.

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Jussie was reportedly attacked on the streets of Chicago in the middle of the night. Two men wearing masks allegedly got the actor’s attention by calling out gay and racial slurs to him.

The assailants then began to hit Smollett with their hands, poured a chemical substance rumored to be bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene. It’s also been reported that the men mentioned, “MAGA,” which is an acronym for President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

Jussie had also reportedly gotten a threatening letter before the attack that had both racial and homophobic speech included. However, he had decided against having any extra security with him.

Fans, friends, family, and other stars have spoken out in love and support of Jussie since the attack. Meanwhile, police are still investigating the crime.

Fans can see more of Jussie Smollett by following him on social media, or watching him on Empire, which airs Wednesday nights on Fox."

The attack, which took place in the early hours of Tuesday morning as he walked home from a Subway outlet, saw the star have an “unknown chemical substance” thrown at him and a thin rope put around his neck. The suspects then fled.

In a statement to media, Smollett's agent said the men shouted ""homophobic and racist,"" slurs at the 36-year-old as they carried out the ""unprovoked,"" attack.

It is also alleged they told the actor he was in ""MAGA country,"" in reference to Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. The president has condemned the attack."

“The most important thing that I can say is to keep it simple and say thank you and I’m OK,” the Empire actor said to massive cheers at a totally packed Troubadour tonight. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to and I’m going to stand strong with you all,” Smollett added to a club that included Empire co-creator Lee Daniels, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, producer and Get Lifted Film Co. partner Mike Jackson and members of the Smollett family.

“I had to be here tonight,” the singer asserted to more cries of support from the audience soon after taking the stage in the legendary West Hollywood venue. “I couldn’t let those motherfuckers win!”

“So, I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that,” a clearly moved Smollett vowed as he also made sure everyone knew “he fought the fuck back” against his assailants.

“Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope you will all stand with me.”

The roars from the crowd indicated that the Troubadour certainly intended to stand with Smollett, who has laid relatively low since the attack in the early hours of Tuesday in the Windy City.

The man who plays openly gay Jamal Lyon on the Fox drama had just returned on January 29 from New York to Chicago where the fifth season of Empire is shot. He supposedly on the street near his apartment at around 2 AM when two men began bellowing derogatory slurs toward him. The two then attacked Smollett, hitting him over and over and pouring an unknown chemical substance over him that is now said to have been bleach. The attackers reportedly also put a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene.

After reporting the incident to police and conducting an initial interview with them, Smollett drove to Northwestern Hospital to be seen by doctors but he was not hospitalized. Bruised, the performer returned home under increased security later that morning and was said to be in good condition, police said.

Chicago police announced very quickly on January 29 that they are treating the matter as a “possible hate crime.” On January 31, one day after local law enforcement released photos of “persons of interest” in the matter, Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi called the incident an “assault and battery case.”

Following the attack on January 29, Empire co-creators Daniels and Danny Strong condemned what had happened to Smollett, as did network Fox. Donald Trump called the assault “horrible” when asked in the White House about it on January 31.

The same day, Smollett’s family said it was an act of “domestic terrorism.” In his own statement, Smollett himself said on February 1 that he was “working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.” The actor added that “despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

The investigation by Chicago PD with help from the FBI and others continues."

As the crowd encouraged him to pull through, he added, ""I'm not fully healed yet but I'm going to and ... I'm going to stand strong with y'all.""

Holding back tears, Smollett continued, ""I had to be here tonight y'all. I couldn't let those motherf**kers win.""

Smollett's family and friends — including his sister, ""Friday Night Lights"" star Jurnee Smollett-Bell — were in attendance to see him perform.

As The Blast previously reported, West Hollywood police were on high alert, amping up security to make sure the actor felt safe when he took the stage.

Smollett broke his silence on Friday, thanking fans in a statement for their support and speaking about his resilience.

“My body is strong but my soul is stronger,"" Jussie Smollett said. ""More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

He continued, “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ”"

(AP) — Jussie Smollett was blunt, emotional and defiantly determined Saturday night at a Southern California concert some urged him not to play, telling the crowd before singing a note that he had to go on with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

“The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the “Empire” actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn’t do that.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,” he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

“And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,” he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she’s glad he did.

“It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,” Davis said. “He showed everyone in the room he was strong.”

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he’s not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in “Empire,” the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, “Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night’s set, along with songs from “Empire.”

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

“To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,” Joel Smollett Jr. said. “But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie’s healing. He’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.”

Fans waited in the rain to listen to the Empire star, who opened his set by explaining why he decided to play after the Jan. 29 incident that generated widespread attention for the gay actor-singer. “I had to be here tonight y’all,” he told the audience. “I couldn’t let those mother f–kers win.”

Smollett also fought back tears as he admitted he wasn’t “fully healed.” But he’s on his way, he added. He was accompanied at the concert by his siblings, including brother Jocqui, who told the crowd that “my family realized that tonight was an important part of Jussie’s healing…. on behalf of the Smollett family, we are so proud of our brother.”

Backed by singers and a keyboardist, Smollett performed “Freedom,” the first track from last year’s debut album Sum of My Music, along with “No Doubt About It,” “Conqueror,” “Good Enough,” “You’re So Beautiful,” and “Heavy” from his Fox series about a fictitious record label and the family that runs it. “This song has new meaning to me,” he said of the latter tune.

Smollett plays Jamal Lyon in Empire, which is currently in its fifth season on Fox.

Empire creator Lee Daniels was among the 400 or so in attendance, along with U.S. Rep Maxine Waters and actor Wilson Cruz (My So-Called Life). There was a scheduled meet and greet for special ticket holders but it was reportedly canceled due to security concerns. But the spirited Smollett still tried to accommodate his enthusiastic fans, one of whom stood in the front row with some copies of the Empire soundtrack.

“I’ll sign them I promise!” said Smollett, who was dressed in a simple white shirt and black pants.

“The hateful rhetoric that gets thrown around, I’m not gonna name names, it has to stop!” Smollett said during his performance. “But it stops with people who believe in love. Take love back because that’s all that we have … These last few days I couldn’t have gotten through without the love of my family and the love of y’all.”

Smollett ended his performance by saying he wanted to clear up a few points. He said he “was bruised but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken.” He went to the doctor immediately after the incident but was not hospitalized. Doctors in Chicago and Los Angeles also cleared him to perform.

“And above all I fought the f— back!” he said, as the crowd cheered. “I’m the gay Tupac!”

In the early hours of Jan. 29, Smollett was walking in Chicago when two alleged offenders reportedly approached him yelling racial and homophobic slurs. According to a police report, the two unknown suspects attacked him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck. After allegedly yelling “this is MAGA country,” the offenders fled the scene.

The police have since released video surveillance images of “persons of interest” in the case but there have been no arrests.

On Friday, Smollett made his first public comment. “Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Halle Berry, Barry Jenkins, and Ariana Grande were among those who expressed outrage on social media about Smollett’s incident.

Taking the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, he fought back tears as he said, “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the motherf—ers win.”

“I have so many words on my heart,” the actor/singer said, addressing the 400-capacity club after embracing members of his family. “The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all… l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me. So now… let’s do it.”

Before his encore, Smollett again addressed the crowd at length.

“Just because there has been a lot of stuff said about me that’s absolutely not true…” he began, seemingly addressing pockets of skepticism on social media about his account of the attack. He paused to cast a glance at the balcony: “I’m sure my lawyer’s sitting up there like. ‘No, Jussie, no! No! Shut the f— up and sing.’” Referring to some notes he’d brought on stage, he moved on to “four points” he said he wanted to address and clarify: “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately… I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all: I fought the f— back.”

After the cheers died down, he roused the crowd again by jokingly announcing: “I’m the gay Tupac! So now, we can do our encore.”

His final words before exiting the stage: “We are proud. We are gay.”

Those in attendance at the Troubadour included Rep. Maxine Waters, filmmaker Lee Daniels and actor Wilson Cruz.

He addressed the latter two near the end of the show, saying, “I promised myself I was not gonna cry tonight… Someone in the crowd that I want to recognize: Wilson Cruz is someone I identified with growing up. I stand on the backs of so many people — of the Lee Daniels and the Wilson. Cruzes — and I pray to God I make you all proud.”

Smollett’s brother, Jojo, introduced him, saying, “There’s been an outpouring of love and support … There’s also been (inflammatory) stories spread that have hurt him deeply,” he added. “I sincerely wanted him to stay out of the public until he healed. And after much debate, some arguing and many tears, my family and I have realized that tonight is an important part of his healing. You see, he’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night and he continues to fight. Jussie is a true artist every time he breathes. But above all else, he is the epitome of love.”

Later, in introducing a song about his boyfriend, Smollett said, “Over these last four days, my man… Everybody should be blessed enough to have a love like that. But love will f— you up.” Another song intro had him pointing out “a lot of my ‘Empire’ family here. Happy to bring to life my character Jamal Lyon. This song, it kind of has a new meaning for me,” he said, making a segue into “Heaven.”

Last week, Smollett issued a statement to Essence that read: “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. … Soon I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.”

Smollett said he was on the phone with his manager Brandon Moore when the attack happened. The two are cooperating with authorities as the incident is investigated as a possible hate crime. Smollett plays an openly gay character on the Fox series “Empire.”

According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, Smollett told them he was beaten by two men who approached him by yelling out “racial and homophobic slurs” at approximately 2 a.m. on Tuesday morning in the 300 block of E. North Water St. They proceeded to assault Smollett and “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him. The two men are also said to have put a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing on foot. Smollett then transported himself to an area hospital after speaking with police.

The Troubadour performance was met with rousing applause, particularly the songs “Hurt People” and “Freedom,” and there were plenty of “Empire” fans in the crowd, several towards the front hoping to get soundtrack albums signed by Smollett (he promised to oblige after the show). Worth noting: the show was sold out before the attack in Chicago occurred.

""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words,"" he added.

During the attack, the suspects punched him and poured an unknown chemical substance over him. One of them even wrapped a rope around the actor's neck.

Smollett, who was hospitalised for his injuries, told the police that the attackers yelled pro-""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) comments during the attack.

In his statement, the actor disputed rumours circulating on social media that he has been less than cooperative with the police and has changed his story time and again.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" he said.

""As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,"" he concluded.

On Empire, Smollett plays musician Jamal Lyon, the gay son of Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie (Taraji P Henson).

The show's team has expressed shock and anger over the attack on Smollett.

Actor Ellen Page also spoke about his case on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. She criticised media for contemplating whether his attack should be treated as a hate crime or not."

Cuaron topped Bradley Cooper for “A Star Is Born,” Spike Lee for “BlacKkKlansman,” Adam McKay for “Vice,” and Peter Farrelly for “Green Book.”

“Thank you, cabron — you are my film career,” a deeply moved Cuaron told last year’s winner, Guillermo del Toro.

Cuaron explained backstage that he had used “cabron,” often an expletive in Spanish, as a term of endearment for del Toro. “Like everything else, it’s a matter of context,” he added.

Cuaron also thanked Participant Media, which financed the black-and-white Spanish-language film, and Netflix, which released it, for their “glorious stupidity.”

The filmmaker singled out Oscar-nominated stars Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira.

“‘Roma’ simply doesn’t exist without the generosity of spirt and effortless grace of Yalitza and Marina,” he said. “They somehow, with the rest of my beautiful cast, managed to bring to life this film from my memory.”

“Roma,” which is set in Mexico City in the 1970s, is based on Cuaron’s boyhood.

It’s the second time that the DGA has honored foreign-language film, 18 years after Ang Lee won for “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” And it’s the second DGA Award that Cuaron has won, five years after taking the trophy and the directing Academy Award for “Gravity.”

Cuaron won the Golden Globe for directing “Roma” against the same four men — Cooper, Farrelly, Lee, and McKay. Cuaron also won the director award from the New York Film Critics Circle.

The DGA Award is one of the top indicators of Oscar glory, with all but seven of the DGA winners since 1948 going on to take the best director Oscar — including del Toro last year for “The Shape of Water.” The last divergence came in 2013 when Ben Affleck won the DGA Award for “Argo,” even though he did not receive an Oscar nom.

About 80% of DGA nominees have gone on to be in the running for an Academy Award in recent years. Cuaron, Lee, and McKay have been nominated for an Oscar this year, along with Yorgos Lanthimos for “The Favourite” and Pawel Pawlikowski for “Cold War.”

Mexico-born directors have won four of the last five directing Oscars, starting with Cuaron in 2014, followed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for “Birdman” and “The Revenant,” and del Toro for “The Shape of Water” last year. Damien Chazelle won the DGA Award and Oscar in 2017 for “La La Land.”

Cuaron’s script for “Roma” is up for a Writers Guild of America award, which will be announced on Feb. 17. “Roma” scored 10 Oscar nominations, tied with “The Favourite.” The Academy Awards will take place Feb. 24.

McKay was still a big winner, taking home the drama series award for HBO’s “Succession.” Ben Stiller nabbed the movies for television and limited series prize for Showtime’s “Escape at Dannemora.”

“This is a dream come true,” Stiller said. “I’ve wanted to be a director since I was 8 years old.”

Tim Wardle’s “Three Identical Strangers” won the documentary award over “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?,” “RBG,” “Free Solo,” and “Hale County This Morning, This Evening.”

“Three Identical Strangers” did not receive an Oscar nomination. Wardle gave a shoutout to Lee for “Do the Right Thing,” saying that it had changed his life.

In an upset, Bo Burnham received the first-time directing award for “Eighth Grade,” topping Cooper, who had been widely expected to win, Carlos Lopez Estrada for “Blindspotting,” Matthew Heineman for “A Private War,” and Boots Riley for “Sorry to Bother You.” The comedy-drama starred Elsie Fisher as an insecure eighth-grader in the final week of school.

“I didn’t think this was mathematically possible,” a stunned Burnham said in his speech.

Bill Hader won the comedy series award for the first episode of HBO’s “Barry.” It topped two episodes of “Atlanta” and two from last year’s winner, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” Hader won the Emmy for actor in a comedy series in September.

“I first came to this ceremony is 2001 when I was a PA on ‘James Dean: An Invented Life’ so be nice to your PAs,” Hader said in his acceptance speech.

Cuaron, in accepting his nomination medallion earlier in the night, took a shot at the Trump administration in noting that many of the world’s 70 million domestic workers are immigrants. “When we vilify them, calling them rapists, we diminish ourselves,” he said.

Cooper gave a passionate reaction to receiving his medallion, saying, “It’s the humanity of making films. I love it so much. I’m never going to stop.”

DGA president Thomas Schlamme opened the ceremony by sending well wishes for a speedy recovery to DGA member Jussie Smollett, who was attacked earlier this week in Chicago in what local law enforcement is investigating as a hate crime. He also promised that the DGA, which has 17,000 members, will push for more inclusion of women and minorities.

“Unions are under near-constant threat,” he said. “Our industry is one of the last strongholds of labor. It’s something that we must never take for granted

Aisha Tyler hosted the event at Hollywood & Highland Center, noting, “Last year’s host Judd Apatow has been recast as a six-foot-tall black woman.”

She evoked major laughter on her opening set by saying she was nostalgic for the presidency of George W. Bush: “He was a cute dumb, not a ‘We’re all gonna die’ dumb.'”

The first award went to Jack Jameson for children’s programs for “Sesame Street’s” “When You Wish Upon a Pickle: A Sesame Street Special.” The variety/talk/news/sports winner was Don Roy King for “Saturday Night Live: Adam Driver; Kanye West” and the variety/talk/news/sports specials victor was Louis J. Horvitz for the “60th Grammy Awards.” King has now won the category for “Saturday Night Live” for four consecutive years.

The reality programs prize went to Russell Norman for the “Japan” segment of Netflix’s “The Final Table.” Spike Jonze of MJZ won the commercials award for “Welcome Home, Apple Homepod.”

FX Networks’ John Landgraf received the DGA diversity award and cited a 2015 Variety article spelling out diversity problems at the cabler as a spur to actively seek changes.

Associate Director Mimi Deaton received the Franklin J. Schaffner Achievement Award and Unit Production Manger Kathleen McGill was awarded the Frank Capra Achievement Award and fell down while walking up to the podium, evoking a standing ovation. “I’m not nervous anymore, that’s for sure,” she said when she began speaking.

Quincy Jones presented Don Mischer, best known for handling live events such as the Olympics and presidential inaugurations, with the previously announced lifetime achievement award in television. He’s won 10 DGA Awards.

“When I was 12, I built my own TV studio in my garage,” Mischer said. “It’s hard for me to put into words how it feels to be included with all of you.”

In the early hours of Tuesday, January 29, Jussie was attacked in Chicago, Illinois, by two unidentified suspects. According to multiple reports, the attack is being classified as an alleged racist and homophobic attack. According to CNN, Jussie’s attackers spewed racial slurs and made derogatory comments about the actor’s sexuality before attacking him.

Jussie Smollett reportedly had a noose-like rope tied around his neck and was doused with bleach. Shortly after reports began circulating about the attack, Jussie’s family, friends, and fans took to social media to share their reactions to the attack. Now, his sister, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, has also released a statement in support of her brother. Jurnee took to social media with a candid photo of her siblings.

She captioned the photo with a description of Jussie’s spirit describing her family as “joyful warriors.” Jurnee admitted the photo captured her family at a happier time in their lives, but she insisted the photo is a representation of the positive energy they desire to maintain.

“Because there’s a light in him that cannot be dimmed, because we are a family of joyful warriors, we will not let this get the best of us. Although this is a picture from happier times, this is the spirit to which we chose to move forward…they will not steal, our joy.”

Below her statement, Jurnee also reposted the official statement released on behalf of the Smollett family. In just a short period of time, Jurnee’s statement has gone viral with tons of fans commenting to offer well wishes to Jussie as he recovers.

Jussie Smollett was reportedly scheduled to make an appearance at Troubadour in West Hollywood, California, on Saturday, February 2. However, the singer/actor released a statement confirming the cancellation of the performance as he recovers from the recent attack. In an emailed statement to ABC News, security concerns were cited as the reason for the seemingly abrupt cancellation.

“Jussie is so honored to perform for his fans, friends and family on Saturday night. However, please forgive us. For security reasons, we cannot accommodate any meet & greets. Your meet & greet upgrade can either be refunded or donated to the Black AIDS Institute in your name,” the statement read.

The Chicago Police Department is currently investigating the attack. Recent reports have confirmed the law enforcement agency have been able to retrieve surveillance footage of the attack. They are now working to identify the assailants."

On Friday's NPR talk show 1A, guest host Todd Zwillich asked Washington Post editorial writer Jonathan Capehart (black and gay) to discuss the ""reported"" attack on Smollett, a star of the Fox drama Empire (black and gay). There was no ""alleged"" anything in Capehart's proclamation, and Capehart was very quick to blame Trump and his rhetoric for the alleged violence:

JONATHAN CAPEHART: I think that for a lot of African Americans, it sent several signals. One, the noose around the neck is unmistakeable. It goes back to segregation, Jim Crow, lynching, the sort of domestic terror that was visited upon African Americans in the South. The fact that it [was] repeatedly said 'This is MAGA country' adds to sort of the atmosphere of menace that African Americans in particular and people of color in general have felt since the advent of the Trump administration, given the rhetoric from the campaign and out of the administration. And then lastly, I would say the fact that Jussie Smollett is [a] famous African American, and that this happened in Chicago sends a clear signal, I think, to African Americans that there are people in this country who want to make it clear that no matter who you are, where you live, you are not safe. If an African American is not safe from racial violence in Chicago -- racially motivated and homophobic, cannot leave that out, homophobic violence -- in an urban center like Chicago, then you're not safe anywhere.

Many blacks in Chicago have been murdered -- whether it's racially motivated or not -- it's not exactly a place where you measure safety from crime. Capehart was an echo of Post reporter Eugene Scott in side-stepping any use of ""alleged.""

Empire co-creator Lee Daniels struck the same Facts-Later note, calling the alleged attack ""just another f---ing day in America.""

Variety TV critic Daniel D'Addario wrote a lecture as well, assuming the worst. Like Capehart, he proclaimed this was ""a heart-grippingly clear example of why so many members of protected classes have come to feel unsafe during a moment in which hatred and rage have come to so thoroughly dominate our national discourse."" The answer, unsurprisingly, is more ""queer artists of color"" in the ""mainstream."""

Chicago detectives are saying that “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett has refused to turn over his personal cellphone that would possibly help in the investigation.

Smollett claimed that he was talking on the phone with his manager at the time that the assault happened, and police want to verify his records to ensure that it was true.

On Tuesday morning, Smollett was walking on a Chicago street when two men allegedly yelled racist remarks before beating him up. The actor was allegedly seen with a rope tied around his neck and says that he was doused in a chemical liquid.

The manager who Smollett says he was on the phone with told police he heard the attackers yell out

“This is MAGA country,” according to officials.

With Smollett refusing to hand over his phone, it is unclear if Chicago authorities will obtain the cell records independently.

Smollett and his family have released a statement on Thursday, one of which said;

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.” “Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

There is a video of the attack as well as a witness who says she saw the alleged men in front of the Chicago apartment where Smollett lives.

As of now, there are two “potential people of interest” but they are not being labeled as suspects."

The statement read, “In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.

Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

“We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

“Radical love is the only solution” to dealing the racism and homophobia they say led to the attack, but warned that “passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world”.

We wish our very own Jamal, like he was popularly called on “Empire,” speedy recovery."

Smollett issued the statement after remaining silent about the alleged assault since media reports about it first surfaced on Tuesday. The matter is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,"" Smollett said in his first statement about the incident he reported on Tuesday.

News of the police report spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggesting the story was a hoax.

In a statement emailed to Reuters late Thursday, Chicago police said Smollett had refused to turn over his cell phone records to detectives, although police later said he was working with investigators.

Smollett and his manager have both told police they were on the phone together when the actor, who plays a gay character on ""Empire,"" was accosted on a Chicago street early on Tuesday by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs, police said.

According to the account he gave police, the two assailants doused Smollett with some kind of chemical liquid before wrapping a rope around his neck and fleeing the scene. The actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police said.

Police said they sought phone records to independently verify that Smollett was on the phone at the time with his manager, who reportedly told police he heard the attackers saying ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

""Cell phone records were not provided to investigators when asked,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an email to Reuters. ""The victim didn't provide them.""

But police had ""no reason to doubt"" the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack, Guglielmi said.

In a later email, another police spokesman, Officer Michael Carroll, said, ""The victim is working with police as we investigate the circumstances of the incident.""

Questions raised about the veracity of his account were troubling, Smollett said in his statement, especially since ""these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender-conforming siblings daily."""

The Empire star sang on Saturday night at the Troubadour club in West Hollywood, appearing publicly for the first time since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men attacked him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

He was joined on the stage by his siblings, who introduced him and embraced him.

'My family and I have realized that tonight is an important part of Jussie's healing. You see, he's been a fighter since he was a baby,' his brother Joel Smollett Jr said.

Before singing a note, Jussie Smollett teared up as he told the crowd he's not fully healed yet, but he will be, and his music will help him.

'I couldn't let the motherf**kers win,' he said, to loud screams from the audience. 'So I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that.'

Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, sat in the crowd with Smollett's family. Also in attendance were actor Jai Rodriguez and film producer Lee Daniels.

During the performance, Smollett thanked his boyfriend for supporting him over the past four days, and sang as song he wrote for the boyfriend called Haha (I Love You).

During the set, Smollett said he fought back against his attackers, and called himself the 'gay Tupac,' referring to the rapper who was gunned down in 1996.

Smollett said that his ribs had been bruised, but not broken as TMZ had previously reported.

'Be as black, be as brown, be as gay as the f**k you want to be!' he said to end the set.

Earlier Saturday, cameras captured Smollett in Los Angeles as his brother loaded bags in a car and then drove away, with Smollett covering his face in the passenger seat.

It comes just days after he reported being attacked in Chicago on Tuesday as he walked home from a Subway restaurant.

The actor, who is gay and black, said he was punched, had bleach poured on him and had noose put around his neck.

Moments later, he was filmed walking into his building with a rope hanging loosely around his neck.

On Friday, Smollett broke his silence to thank fans for the outpouring of support he has received since the alleged attack.

The Empire star told Essence in a statement: 'Let me start by saying that I'm OK.

'My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you.

'The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.'

He added that while he was 'frustrated' with 'certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations' about the case, he believes 'justice will be served.'

'I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.

'As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.

'I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.

'We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.'

'Photos (pictured) of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,' police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Wednesday evening

'Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.

'With Love, respect & honor…Jussie,' he said.

It is the first time he has spoken since being targeted in downtown Chicago by two men who he said shouted 'this is MAGA country!' and attacked him as he walked home.

The reported attack was not captured on surveillance footage. Smollett was seen entering his apartment building moments after it happened with a rope around his neck.

He said he was on the phone to his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, when he was jumped and Moore corroborated his story earlier this week.

A week before the attack, Smollett reportedly received a homophobic and racist death threat in the mail.

It was sent to the studio where he films Empire and is said to have terrified staff.

Police are working to find two men they believe may be responsible and are appealing to the public for information.

Smollett's neighbor has also described seeing two suspicious 'redneck' types standing outside their luxury apartment building 90 minutes before the attack took place.

One had a rope hanging out of his sweatshirt, she said, and they looked out of place. She said the were wearing 'grey hunting socks.'

Smollett had not long arrived back in Chicago from New York City when he was attacked.

His flight was delayed by several hours leaving and he documented his frustration about the late arrival on Instagram before he got home.

He was filmed on surveillance cameras leaving the Subway at around 2am and walking towards the apartment.

Police on Thursday confirmed that he was filmed on the same street as the two persons of interest whose images have been released at one point during his journey home.

The 36-year-old actor was walking down the street and the two men were sitting on a bench facing opposite him.

Smollett and his manager Brandon Z. Moore both told police they were on the phone when the attack happened. Moore said he heard the attackers yell 'this is MAGA country'. It is not clear if he is the person who called 911 or if it was someone else but Smollett refused to hand over his phone when police asked for it to verify that they had been on the phone

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, that appears to be dated from January 18, stating that 'You will die black f*g'. Fox Studio received the letter on the 22nd and cops said it was laced with powder Tylenol

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

They got up and walked away and all three walked out of the cameras' view.

Smollett was picked back up by a different camera 60 seconds later as he entered his apartment building.

He had the rope around his neck and there was salt on the front of his sweatshirt from the ground.

At 2.35am, an associate of the actor's called 911 and officers arrived at an apartment where he was at 2.42am.

It is not clear if it was his apartment that they went to or his friend's.

After giving his statement, Smollett took himself to hospital where he was treated for lacerations to the face.

The attack took place here, in the street, outside the apartment building where Smollett stays while he is in Chicago filming. It is in between two luxury apartment buildings and two hotels but police say they have not yet recovered surveillance footage of it

Smollett, 36, who is also a singer, is due to perform on Saturday night in Los Angeles

Police had asked him to turn over his phone for them to verify that he had been on a call with his manager, as both claimed, when the incident happened but he refused, saying he was uncomfortable doing so.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Gugliemi told DailyMail.com on Thursday that it was not suspicious for him to have refused doing so and that he may have been concerned with privacy.

He has been entirely cooperative otherwise, he said.

The attack has enraged the country and caught the attention of the president who deemed it 'horrible' on Thursday.

'That's horrible....there is nothing worse, as far as I am concerned,' Trump said on when asked about the incident.

Smollett's famous family released a statement abhorring the attack, and countless celebrities, including his Empire co-stars, have also spoken out to support him.

He is due to perform a show in Los Angeles on Saturday night."

The mere thought of venturing outside your home is as perilous as taking a brief nap in quicksand. You literally might die! God forbid you watch any more of the news, filled to the edge with the po-faced grimacing of sickly-looking pundits whinging about the apocalyptic promise of a no-deal Brexit. What does one do when life itself is cause for immense panic?

Why, you stay in and watch the Super Bowl, of course. You’re guaranteed to be entertained for at least four hours, which might be the last four hours you ever spend on this planet. If you’re not thrilled by the billion-dollar spectacle, you’ll be numbed into submission by the sweet crackling of hot bone-on-bone action and the expensive beer commercials starring celebrities pantomiming getting kicked in the nuts. At least you’re not freezing to death.

The National Football League championship game is something of a holiday here in the States – men and women gather ‘round their ludicrously gargantuan flat screens to watch people attempt to cripple each other in order to celebrate capitalism’s rousing defeat over such nefarious forces as “empathy” and “moderation.” Since 9/11, the NFL has only become more inseparable from America’s identity and sense of self-worth. While it’s far and away the most popular sport in the US across multiple demographics, the very DNA of the game is tied to red state culture, with its dedication to the flag and emphasis on “traditional” values.

The television series Friday Night Lights, and the film it was based on, was soapy mainstream entertainment, but the story it told of small-town Americans obsessed with the machinations of teenagers on the gridiron, is based in a fundamental truth. The Buzz Bissinger non-fiction book the movie and series were based on told a real story about the grip American football has on the rural parts of the country – one that shows no signs of loosening any time soon. It should come as no surprise, then, that the NFL has become a focal point in the never ending American culture war.

Sunday’s game is the culmination of the months-long NFL season, but it’s also one of the few remaining mass entertainment institutions in the US that doesn’t involve Marvel Comics characters punching CGI monsters in front of a green-screen. The Super Bowl party is a chance for us Yanks to put aside our ideological difference to scream at something other than CNN. My household Super Bowl tradition involves each guest being forced to eat an entire bucket of fried chicken in one sitting. The last person to finish gets punched in the stomach.

In the UK, though, the Super Bowl is a curiosity on par with Channel 5’s 2001 reality competition series Touch the Truck, which is exactly what it sounds like: touch the truck long enough and you get to keep it. The Super Bowl might not be quite as pedantic as watching a person stand around doing nothing, but it is on at an unseemly hour and features esoteric, labyrinthine rules that can alienate even the most devoted follower of the NFL. In fact, I’d estimate that it’s easier to jump into an episode of Touch the Truck on YouTube than it is to watch the Super Bowl. But if you want to understand the state of the States and exactly why we’re in this mess, football is the best place to start.

NFL games are one of the last places that it’s socially acceptable to enjoy country music, if the continued use of singer Carrie Underwood on NBC’s Sunday Night Football broadcast is any indication. Despite the protests of our precious cultural elites, with their upturned noses and borderline obsession with Cardi B’s Instagram, Underwood’s Sunday Night Football theme tune remains intact. The only time I see Underwood on TV is on Sunday nights, which is equal parts the passage of her cultural high point and my own ignorance about anything that goes on in red states that doesn’t end up in a ponderous New York Times feature story.

The NFL knows it must appeal to the demographics I don’t belong to, that it has to cultivate this fan base which makes up the most rabid supporters of the sport. It’s one of the reasons the saga of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick threatened the immensely profitable peace of “America’s Game.” When Kaepernick chose to kneel for the customary pre-game singing of the Star-Spangled Banner in 2016, he exacerbated a simmering cold war between the factions within football fandom. The liberal contingent of sports fans rallied behind Kap’s right to free speech, but also the message he was trying to communicate with his action: America has a persistent problem with racial inequality that we seem to have no interest in reckoning with.

Despite the cavalcade of horrific news stories about the rise of white supremacy in the US that bolstered Kaepernick’s thesis – from Charlottesville to the latest tragedy involving Empire star Jussie Smollett – he remains persona non grata in the NFL. He’s even gone to the lengths of suing the league, alleging collusion in keeping him unemployed. The stand he took did earn him a lucrative sponsorship deal and visible ad campaign courtesy of Nike, but in the eyes of many football fans he’s still highly controversial.

As with any major cultural flashpoint in America, President Trump clumsily squeezed himself into the Kaepernick matter many times over, calling anyone who protested a “son of a bitch” – which constitutes one of his milder insults. Trump’s histrionic 2017 tweets vilifying Kap and any other players protesting the national anthem resulted in a showy week of NFL players, coaches, and owners banding together to express a vague sense of solidarity in the face of the attacks.

It was a valiant effort on their part: they did their level best to make fans and pundits forget what this whole thing was about. So what followed was baffling: an aborted attempt to punish those who didn’t stand for the anthem, which was widely seen as capitulation to Trump’s bullying. It was so roundly mocked as a form of surrender that the policy was vaporized before it could even be implemented.

What the leaders of football have come to realise is that all of this is unavoidable. While the NFL has officially sought to be above the base, distasteful business of politics, its aforementioned standing within American society means it has always and will continue to be dragged into the mire. Still, they carrying on hoping to play both sides, a tactic that is increasingly becoming archaic in our polarized reality. When asked about Trump’s previous comments that the sport had become “soft,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell responded by saying “We have a lot of fans, the president among them.”

It’s true that Trump is a fan of American football, so much so that he famously mounted a failed rival league, the USFL, in the 1980s. He even tried to buy the Buffalo Bills franchise in 2014. His ties to the sport run even deeper, though. Sunday’s game features the dynastic juggernaut known as the New England Patriots, a team with clear and open ties to the president. A recent report by the Los Angeles Times detailed how Patriots owner Robert Kraft reached out to Trump for help securing a trade deal with Canada that would guarantee the NFL millions of dollars from the sale of broadcast rights to the league in Canada.

Since then Trump’s attacks have ceased, and besides the ongoing litigation around Kaepernick’s collusion charges the NFL has gone back to business as usual. The build-up to this year’s Super Bowl has been mercifully free of political squabbling and self-righteous posturing. As much as I’d like this to be a sign that we too can move past the last three years of perpetual in-fighting, this detente is guaranteed to be short-lived. Surely, another front will open up in this rhetorical pillow fight. Maybe halftime show performers Maroon 5 will unfurl a Palestinian flag during their set. Could Patriots quarterback Tom Brady remove his jersey to reveal a “Build the Wall” t-shirt? What if the Los Angeles Rams win the game and refuse to visit the White House, then donate their championship bonus to Kamala Harris?

I certainly hope not. I’m hardly the “stick to sports” guy conservative Americans are so fond of lashing out at, but I also would like to enjoy my Bud Light commercials in peace. The one thing right-wing bloviators are correct about is that sport is meant to be an escape. I’ve grown tired of mixing my personal ideological convictions with the simple, binary pleasures of watching two teams compete in an athletic contest.

As politics becomes more and more like a grim, mutant version of sport with the fate of humanity at stake, I increasingly yearn for actual sport’s pedantic, low-stakes heroes and villains. Whether or not you watch the Super Bowl in America should not be a proxy for your leanings on the political spectrum or a litmus test for your wokeness.

I envy all those in the UK, able to watch Sunday’s game without wondering what it says about you as a citizen. Enjoy this most unique cultural export if you can, because the state of things is not making it easy for me. The Super Bowl should be pure, or as pure as any comically overblown brand extension devise can ever be. This is not a time to squabble over our differences. It should be a time to get together, eat a whole bucket of chicken, and punch your best friend in the stomach – like God intended.
