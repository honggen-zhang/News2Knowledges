The attack was caught on video.

UC Berkeley campus police arrested Greenberg on Friday. He bonded out of jail and his arraignment is set for Wednesday. CNN has reached out to Greenberg’s representatives for comment.

The attack occurred at Sproul Plaza on February 19, officials said. Turning Point USA identified the alleged victim to CNN as Hayden Williams, who had been invited to UC Berkeley to help recruit students for a yet-to-be-formed chapter on campus.

Deputy District Attorney Rebecca Warren filed the charges against Greenberg. They include felony assault, felony battery, felony criminal threats and a misdemeanor vandalism charge. The criminal threats charge says it is a “serious felony” and further alleges “that the threatened crime, on its face and under the circumstances in which it was made, was so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to convey to Hayden Williams a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution.”

Before the charges were filed, a media representative for Williams said he is a field representative for the Leadership Institute, an organization that helps train conservative leaders. Williams is not a UC Berkeley student, the representative said.

“The fact that the victim was not a campus affiliate has no bearing on this case. He had every right to be on campus, and every right to express his point of view,” said university spokesman Dan Mogulof.

Incident caught on video, shows two attackers

A short video recorded by a witness shows Williams and a man struggling before the man punches Williams in the face, knocking his hat off. The alleged suspect then gets close to Williams’ face, calls him “racist,” and shouts profanities before punching Williams again and walking away.

Williams told CNN shortly after the assault that he was fine but declined to answer other questions. He was treated at the scene, his media representative said.

Arda Erbil, the student who shot the footage provided to CNN, said he saw two men harassing Williams. As one of the men became physical, Erbil began to record video.

“Seeing something like that happen in such an open place was disheartening,” he said.

The University of California Police Department said in a statement that officers responded to a “report of a disturbance” on upper Sproul Plaza, a center of student activity on campus, where they found the injured victim. According to the police statement, the victim said that two men approached him, a verbal altercation ensued and he began recording the interaction on his phone.

One of the men “slapped the phone out of the victim’s hand,” police said. “The suspect then knocked over the table the victim was at and the two men struggled over the phone. During the incident, the suspect punched the victim several times causing injury to the victim’s eye and nose.”

Williams told Fox News’ Sean Hannity shortly after the attack that some students were upset by a sign he had displayed at his recruitment table that said, “Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims” — apparently a reference to “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who has been accused of staging what he maintains was a hate crime against him.

“This person claimed we were promoting violence on campus and proceeded to take his aggression out on us,” Williams told Hannity.

University condemns assault

UC Berkeley’s chancellor and vice chancellor condemned the assault in a statement February 21, calling it “reprehensible.”

“That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here,” the statement said. “Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.”

The statement added that university officials have “no information indicating” the perpetrators are affiliated with UC Berkeley.

The incident illustrates the “hate and anger so many on the left harbor and that our student activists encounter on a daily basis,” Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA’s founder and president, said in a statement last month.

“Our amazing grassroots organizers courageously face threats of violence and discrimination as they fight for the right for conservative voices to be heard on college campuses,” Kirk said, adding he was proud of how the group’s student activists handled the situation.

Campus known for promoting free speech accused of bias against conservative views

While UC Berkeley has a long history of promoting the tenants of free speech, in recent years there have been protests against conservatives and far right ideologues that have turned violent.

In 2017, a number of protests broke out ahead of speaking engagements by conservative commentators such as Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter. Neither of those events went forward.

Later that year, conservative radio host Ben Shapiro gave a talk as protesters swarmed outside. Nine people were arrested, but the protests appeared to be mostly peaceful."

But like the Democrat leadership in Virginia (which used to be considered a part of the “Good South”), Democrats have more racial issues plaguing them these days than Republicans. Soon that state might change its motto to “Virginia is for Lovers of Black Shoe Polish.”

Remember a couple of years ago when the former Starbucks CEO and current presidential candidate took a break from selling over-priced coffee to white people and decided he would try to end racism? Schultz seems to have done that; almost every couple in TV commercials now is interracial, and they seem happy.

Schultz instructed his baristas, the tattooed and nose-ringed students majoring in Women and Gender Studies and carrying $45,000 in student loan debt, to lecture customers on race. This I know for sure: If anyone wants to start a “conversation” with you about race, he is doing two things: calling you racist and presuming to virtuously lecture you on the matter.

Little known fact: I minored in Gender Studies in college. But back then there were only two sexes, so I am not sure I could make a living in the field today.

If Schultz had not bowed to public pressure and ended the “Race Together” campaign (where baristas wrote that message on customers’ cups), we would have been handed that insult on top of the injury of standing in line for a $6.50 cup of coffee in a place that employs snooty baristas. Once a Starbucks employee asked a customer’s name so he might write it on the customer’s cup. The man said, “Marc with a C.” The employee promptly wrote “Cark” on his cup.

If we are going to slow the line at Starbucks for a conversation on anything, it ought to be why it charges $6.50 for a cup of gritty coffee that you can get at McDonald’s for $1.50. Talk is cheap; why not a latte? Let’s talk about how much the dolts who buy coffee each day at Starbucks, versus at McDonald’s or making it themselves, could save in a year. $6.50 minus $1.50 is $5. So, 365 days times about $5 extra per day is $1,825 a year, assuming you don’t tip the hipster “philosophers” who write your name on your cup.

Starbucks is not a lecture hall; it is a place to meet someone you don’t quite trust in your home, or from whom you are buying something on Craigslist. At best, it is a place to finish a term paper. A lecture hall is the venue for the Grammys, Oscars or any entertainment awards show. This year, you could get six hour of college credit for watching the Oscars. Starbucks ultimately decided to leave the race baiting to the professionals: Jesse Jackson, Jussie Smollett and Al Sharpton.

Of late, the media have been scouring the nation to find pseudo race-based incidents they can highlight on the news. They misreport, with obvious bias, and then extrapolate to brand each incident as indicative of all of America. As with all hoaxes like the Jussie Smollett case, the media seem to relish giving the condescending stink eye to America on race without checking the facts.

In a lame attempt to pit the races against each other, the left’s renewed focus on race stems largely from the Ferguson, MO case. To review their best set of facts: Michael Brown was the African-American, inner-city youth with a troubled past. Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson traces his family back to England, where white people were invented.

Race relations are much worse after President Obama. I really felt he was in the best position to pull us together, but he did the opposite.

The reason Howard Schultz is appealing is that he is a successful capitalist who is talking ideas. But there is no longer room for ideas in the dogma of the new Democrat Party, which requires its members to vote in mindless lockstep with leadership. The seismic shift to socialism in his party makes it hard for Schultz to run, since he is actually a Democrat.

We asked college students at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., if they still trust the news media after the recent bad track record.

“No, but honestly I never have,… they only put out what they want you to know. For all of the fake that they’re putting out, its ridiculous, you can’t trust the media,” responded one student.

Another said, “I would say probably not, because I feel like they jumped too quick to reporting before they had any conclusive evidence.”

One student said that we should always trust alleged victims that the media reports because it could be “triggering” if we don’t. “I think that we should always trust victims, and questioning victims is very problematic and dangerous. This case with Jussie was literally insane, but usually victims aren’t someone that I would go out to question, that’s very triggering.” (RELATED: Robin Roberts Opens Up About Jussie Smollett Interview)

Although many students expressed skepticism or suspicion toward the news media when questioned, few said that they were willing to back up the president’s frequent critiques of the media’s credibility.

One student refuted Trump’s comments about the media by saying calling them “fake” is disrespectful, “I disagree when he calls them “fake news” because I feel like that is just disrespectful to people who work so hard. But also, I think being skeptical and also like criticizing them and calling them “fake” are completely different.” (RELATED: ‘Good Morning America’ Host Robin Roberts Breaks Silence On Jussie Smollett Interview)

Another said that the label of “fake news” poses a threat to the First Amendment. “I think one of the things that this country prides itself on, if anything, is the First Amendment: he freedom of not just speech and everything, but journalism. The fact that we are entitled to get the truth, even if the truth is not favorable to the man that sits in the highest level of office.”"

Smollett staging an attack on himself doesn't sound like the guy she knows, Latifah says.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett was arrested last month on felony charges for falsifying a police report — he allegedly paid two brothers to stage an attack against him and make it look like a hate crime. Now, Queen Latifah has said that she’s standing by Smollett until there’s indisputable proof that he’s guilty as charged.

Latifah made comments supporting Smollett while appearing on the Yahoo News show Through Her Eyes.

The star of Chicago and Hairspray was reluctant to speak about Smollett when asked but commented anyway.

“Until somebody can show me some proof otherwise, I’m going with him. The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet,” Latifah said. “That’s just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof — which I haven’t seen yet. I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.”

At that time of the alleged attack, Smollett, who is gay, said that the assailants doused him with a chemical, hung a noose around his neck, and hurled racist and homophobic epithets at him, making it appear as if he were the victim of a hate crime.

The host of Through Her Lens, Zainab Salbi, asked Latifah if she thought the alleged attack on Smollett was racially motivated.

“This whole thing started off from him allegedly being attacked by some guys who appeared to be white guys wearing a hat that said “Make America Great Again,” yelled epithets at him, and said, This is MAGA country,” Latifah said. “The whole thing started off looking [racially motivated]. So how could you not take that into account?”

“Everything that’s happened since then… I don’t even know what to make of it,” Latifah said regarding the revelations that led to Smollett’s arrest. “All I know is I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.”

Smollett was released on $100,000 bond the day he was arrested. Shortly after, Empire producers suspended him and released a statement saying that his character Jamal Lyon would be scrubbed from the final episodes of the fifth season."

Yesterday my Instagram was ringing with comments on a Meek Mill post from the Ellen Show, which glorified a black elementary school boy as he rapped a song from newly appointed criminal justice reform champion Meek Mill. The 8 year old sang versus about cooking crack in the kitchen as the Ellen crowd erupted in cheers and praise. Seeing an 8 year old black child being used to promote the same acts that are responsible for the mass incarceration of our young black generation was very disheartening. The new culture lead by the most influential black Americans has embraced a message that normalizes self degradation.

The recent allegedly staged hate crime by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett is a dark symbol of how liberalism, victimization and entitlement have metastasized throughout American Black culture.

When I originally heard this story, it brought back some vivid memories of my teenage years dealing with skin heads, the KKK, and other white supremacist groups in Texas. During my senior year of high school, while playing football under the Friday night lights, I had to deal with nooses being dangled in the stands. In 1996, we were the number one rated team in the state. Our rivals would do anything to get the betters of us. Fans from one opposing team decided to “string up” black dolls with my jersey number on them. Specifically, these fans from Southlake Carroll High School even developed a theme for our highly anticipated rivalry game; “TANHO,” which stood for “tear a n-word’s head off.” Instead of playing victim, I used the other team’s racist antics to motivate me. Needless to say we beat the Southlake Carroll Dragons that night on the way to an undefeated season, and a Texas State title.

My experiences growing up black in the deep-south, combined with my extensive global travel have helped shape my perspective on race and equality in America. And I’ve vowed to always try to inspire others to transcend those who use nooses to intimidate and impede our race, including other black Americans.

No Self Accountability

Our outward cry for sympathy can’t be as strong as our inward pursuit of accountability and prosperity. Too often we rise up and protest harder against other races' acts of oppression, than we do when we terrorize ourselves. Jussie Smollett’s alleged Chicago hate crime skit got more attention from America’s most powerful black leaders than the dozens of murders committed by black kids in any given weekend in the Windy City.

I was never satisfied with President Obama’s efforts to curb black-on-black violence, especially in Chicago — his home town. Now, we are witnessing Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker call Smollett’s skit — “a modern day lynching.” Prior to their comments on Smollett, neither had done enough to stand-up for the thousands of black kids murdered and their mothers who are burying their babies every week in inner cities across America. Most of these cities are run by Democrats, who base their agenda and talking points on what their constituents want to hear, not what they need to hear. This is how elected officials put a figurative “noose” around our necks.

Criminal Justice Hypocrisy

After Bill Clinton’s 1994 Crime Bill was passed, the number of black men locked up for non-violent crimes soared to the millions. Several black Democrats supported this bill then. Ironically 25 years later, many black Democrats were opposed to rolling back this toxic legislation simply because the First Step Act was backed by the Trump Administration.

Despite their tough talk against the broken criminal justice system, black leaders like Sens. Harris and Booker and Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee and John Lewis all put their liberal agenda ahead of bringing freedom and reform to thousands of black men locked up for non-violent crimes. It’s unimaginable to think that the most prominent black leaders in America are using their voting power to keep “nooses” on the necks of our underserved prison population.

Money, Fame, Likes, and Followers

Money, and fame, along with likes and followers on social media, have too often replaced spirituality, love, and community service in the black community. This is caused by our disconnect with our roots and a mentality that has lead us to value money and fame more than helping our own people who are living without access to life’s basic needs. Blacks in America and abroad continue to be the sickest, the poorest, and the most under-educated. Living in America puts us in the upper echelon of the world, no matter your race. Most of my brothers and sisters tend to forget that a black person on welfare in America is wealthy compared to nearly a billion Africans.

Lebron James has recently chosen to compare NFL players to “slaves” and the owners their “slave masters.” Well Mr. James, I played 5 years in the NFL, had my masters degree before I got there, then went on to pursue another degree which was all paid for by the National Football League. As a matter of fact, the NFL gives former players up to $40,000 a year post-retirement to pursue continued education. To make ignorant statements like this about men who make an average of $2.1 million a year, while there are still up to 40 million people actually living in slavery around the world is toxic rhetoric for our young black kids to hear from the most popular black athlete on the planet. Lebron received overwhelming support for this idiocy, further proving that many blacks have completely lost the reality that hundreds of millions of our ancestors live without access to clean water and basic food and medicine, many still in slavery. Like the great Marcus Garvey said, “A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots” and that tree cannot grow.

The Hip Hop Effect

What about the self-proclaimed “leaders” — many of whom, unfortunately, have made their fortunes from promoting and marketing destructive behavior to the black community. I grew up on Hop Hip music and though I was sickened by Meek Mill's support of an 8 year promoting cooking up crack and hustling, I like his music. I still love listening to the latest Jay Z or DJ Khaled track. As a 40 year old man who grew up with both parents, going to great public schools, I can keep music in perspective. We cannot expect a young black kid, with no positive father or mentor to fully understand why they can’t afford to imitate the lifestyle they hear in the lyrics of artists like Future, Jay Z and Beyoncé. Take for example, their recent hit song with DJ Khaled called “Top Off.” In it, the 49-year-old Jay Z repeats “I got the police behind me, ain’t gone stop” then “take the top of the Maybach, f*** these cops.”

In the midst of a national crisis of police shooting unarmed black men, we have our most respected African American entertainer and businessman spreading a message that could easily encourage black youth to hate and disrespect all law enforcement. This is like putting a “noose” around necks of these young black kids.

When I grew up, the Hip Hop culture definitely helped give me the courage to carry my first gun and to sell my first bag of weed. Fortunately, I had parents whom I feared and respected, so I never pushed my flirtation with the criminal lifestyle to the point where I faced serious consequences like jail time. I was blessed. Millions of other black men and women from my generation were not as lucky. They succumbed to the crack epidemic. Now crack baby boomers fill our prisons. Ironically, prison reform is now being cheered on by many of the same rappers who promoted a lifestyle which helped lead these people to prison. Now they are promoting 8 year olds to perform these songs.

I recently heard my 6-year-old son repeating the lyrics of a song called “Mask Off” — by the rapper Future. It was a platinum hit five times over. It promotes drug culture and the casual use of opioids like Percocet and “Molly” — a slang term used for the drug MDMA. This is just one of many hit Hip Hop songs glorifying drug use while we are in the middle of a nationwide opioid epidemic that is killing over 150 people a day. The same vicious cycle that I lived through in the 1980’s and 90’s is happening right before our eyes. Is anyone surprised to see a new generation of young black boys who kill each other by the thousands every year, don’t respect law enforcement and have embraced a Hip Hop culture that promotes the use of lethal drugs?

Today, about 50 percent of black boys drop out of school. Many of them go on to use or sell drugs. It’s the saddest form of life imitating art. The lessons are learned from the rappers they idolize. Where are the songs promoting education? Or calling out their peers who are polluting the minds of our kids? How about songs praising good police officers. This would give more credibility to the black community’s attempts to hold the bad ones accountable? It’s time to stand up and demand that these proclaimed leaders of the Hip Hop world stop putting nooses around our kids necks.

“Until somebody can show me support otherwise, I’m going with him,” Latifah said Tuesday on “Through Her Eyes,” a Yahoo News show. “The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet. And that’s just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof — which I haven’t seen yet — then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.”

She did add, “I don’t even know what to make of it. All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.” Watch below:

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

By Feb. 21, he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false report.

The Chicago Police Department claimed the Nigerian-American brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo told them the attack was orchestrated by the “Empire” actor and that they were paid $3,500. However, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” and “went too far” when they said Jussie sent a hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself.

TMZ also reported, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson may have also gone too far when he said Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.'” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

TMZ also reported, “There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the ‘attack’ — Bon [Abel Osundairo] wrote, ‘I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.’ Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ‘This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.'” The $3,500 breakdown was reportedly “$600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks,” according to TMZ reports.

Smollett maintains his innocence.

Robin Roberts had doubts about Jussie Smollett’s alleged “hate crime” attack before she interviewed him about it on Good Morning America.

During her solo panel at The Cut‘s “How I Get It Done” event, the ABC News anchor shared the details about her high-profile interview with the Empire star weeks after he claimed he was the victim of a hate crime on the streets in Chicago — and weeks before police accused him of staging the attack for publicity.

Like many, Roberts saw some “red flags” in Smollett’s story when news of the attack first broke. But, unlike other critics, she was put in the awkward position of being asked to interview him on national television before law enforcement had a chance to conduct a full investigation.

After telling the crowd that all she wanted to get from Smollett was “the truth,” Roberts admitted she was initially hesitant to even conduct an interview with him because not much about the attack had been confirmed at the time.

Recalling how the GMA booking department had reached out to her about sitting down with the 35-year-old actor, Roberts explained:

“I’ll be completely honest, I said, ‘I don’t know if I’m going to do the interview or not.’ Let’s just wait and see, let’s see if more information comes in.”

Roberts was particularly skeptical about interviewing Smollett after he made comments in the days following the attack. She maintained that sitting down with him on GMA made “no sense” if he was just going to “lawyer up” or refuse to share details that weren’t previously reported.

But, days later, Smollett’s team apparently reached out to GMA “outraged by people making assumptions about whether it happened or not,” according to Roberts, and made her an offer she couldn’t refuse: the actor was fine with being challenged on anything the anchor saw as “red flags” and would also say things he hadn’t already said elsewhere.

Like any good journalist, Roberts took the bait. She recalled:

“I’m like — as a journalist and as a newsperson, this is his right. He’s going on the record for the first time. Yes, I’ll do the interview.”

How could she not!?

Roberts explained that her GMA team went through the police report and conducted additional research before the interview, which was conducted on Tuesday, February 12 — two days before it aired on Feb. 14.

During the panel, Roberts admitted she wasn’t sure how the actor was going to react, but acknowledged that she made an effort to be as neutral as possible — especially being a gay black woman reporting on an alleged hate crime on a gay black man.

She explained:

“He’s saying that it was a hate crime. So if I’m too hard on him, then people in my LGBTQ community are going, ‘Oh, you don’t believe him.’ If I’m too light on him, then it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.’ So it was, like, it was a no-win situation for me.”

As it would turn out, Roberts was criticized for going too easy on the actor. To that, the anchor said she would have pushed him harder with her questioning if more details had come to light before the interview was conducted. She confessed:

“It was hurtful, some of the things that were said. I’ll be honest. Because I pride myself on being fair. I know how much work went into being balanced about what to ask, to challenge him on certain things… Had I had that information or what the brothers were alleging — heck, yeah, I would have asked that. But it aired that morning [and] we taped it two days ahead of time.”

She was working with what she had a the time. Can you blame her for trying to be fair?

We wonder how hard Roberts would go on Smollett if she had the chance to interview him again…

*Queen Latifah says she is standing by embattled actor Jussie Smollett in the wake of his alleged hate crime controversy.

In a wide-ranging interview with the Yahoo News show “Through Her Eyes,” the award-winner singer/actress says she will support the “Empire” star until conclusive evidence to support claims from law enforcement that he staged an attack on himself convinces her otherwise.

“The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet. And that’s just the guy I know,” Latifah said. “So until I can see some definitive proof – which I haven’t seen yet – then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.”

OTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Robin Roberts Gets Candid About Her ‘Emotional’ Interview with Jussie Smollett

Last month, Smollett was hit with a felony charge of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report in January after claiming he was attacked by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him.

Chicago police initially called it a possible hate crime, but now say that Jussie hired two Nigerian-American brothers to help him stage the assault as part of an elaborate publicity stunt because he’s allegedly disgruntled about his “Empire” salary.

He’s is out on $100,000 bond, and is due back in court March 14. In the meantime, Smollett has been suspended from the hit Fox show.

Smollett insists he did not stage the attack.

As we previously reported, GMA’s Robin Roberts has opened up about her headline-making sit-down with Jussie and acknowledged that she felt the pressure to represent the LGBT community.

“I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man,” Roberts said during her solo panel at The Cut’s “How I Get It Done” event on Monday. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.’”

“It was a no-win situation for me,” she explained.

Days after the interviewed aired, two the Nigerian brothers came forward and reportedly told investigators that they were paid by the actor to stage the attack.

“People are looking at the interview through the eyes of ‘How did you not know?’” Roberts recalled. “I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.”

“I pride myself in being fair, I know how much work went into being balanced about what had happened and to challenge him on certain things,” she said.

""All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.""

Queen Latifah is standing behind Jussie Smollett until there's ""definitive proof"" that his alleged hate crime was a hoax.

While speaking to Zainab Salbi, host of the Yahoo News show ""Through Her Eyes"", Latifah, who at first seemed hesitant to talk about the situation, said she isn't withdrawing her support for Smollett just yet. Smollett, who worked in an ""Empire""/""Star"" crossover episode with Latifah, has maintained his innocence amid allegations he filed a false police report and staged a fake hate crime against himself.

""I'm not about to discuss Jussie Smollett,"" Latifah immediately replied. ""Somebody can show me some proof, otherwise I'm going with him because the guy I've seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who's very kind and who's always been cool and sweet. And that's just the guy I know.""

She added, ""So until I can see some definitive proof -- which I haven't seen yet -- then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.""

When Salbi asked if we should look at the whole situation through a racial justice ""lens,"" Latifah replied, ""Well I think you always would have to. You should always be aware of that regardless. I mean this whole thing started off [with] him allegedly being attacked by some guys -- who appeared to be white guys -- wearing hats that said 'Make America Great Again' and yelled epithets at him and said, 'This is MAGA country.'""

""So the whole thing started off being like that,"" she continued. ""So how could you not take that into account, but everything that's happened since then has been, who knows what it is. I don't even know what to make of it. All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.""

Smollett turned himself in and was booked by Chicago PD on Feb. 21 under a felony charge for filing a false police report; following claims he made about being attacked by racist, homophobic, MAGA supporters. He was released on $100,000 bond. Chicago police are maintaining they believe Smollett orchestrated the attack with two Nigerian brothers, who he had also hired as his personal trainers.

The response to his indictment, following weeks of media attention on what was first believed to be a hate crime, took over social media as many celebrities weighed in on the situation. While many changed their opinion -- from supporting Smollett to then bashing him over a possible hoax -- there are some, like Latifah and Smollett's ""Empire"" co-star Terrence Howard, who are standing behind Smollett.

Initially, fans were pouring out their hearts in support of Jussie. When he appeared on Good Morning America with Robin Roberts, fans were still standing by his side. But just one day after the interview, the Chicago Police Department revealed perplexing details about the case that suggested Jussie Smollet may have orchestrated his own attack.

As expected, the scathing reports sparked a media firestorm and fans were no longer convinced he was as innocent as he initially claimed. Apparently, Robin Roberts reportedly feels the same way. According to The Jasmine Brand, Robin Roberts is finally speaking out about the interview and she’s admitting she actually felt some kind of way about the situation.

In fact, Robin has revealed she had reservations about interviewing Jussie Smollett before the Chicago Police Department revealed its speculation of the Empire star’s alleged actions.

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like, ‘I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not.’ I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up.’ And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

Robin Roberts went on to reveal she ultimately decided to conduct the interview because Jussie reportedly planned to reveal things about the attack he hadn’t spoken about publicly. As a veteran journalist, Robin felt the discussion would be “newsworthy” if Jussie would be offering more details.

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said,’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview.'”

Robin Roberts also shared her perspective of the situation from the stance of a gay person. As a gay woman, she explained the obstacle she faced as a member of the LGBT community.

“I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man. He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother.’

Despite more than 20 years in journalism, Robin Roberts has admitted the interview with Jussie Smollett was one of the most difficult she’s ever conducted.

“It was one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do.”

Although Jussie still maintains his innocence, he’s being charged with filing a false police report. He is scheduled to appear in court again on March 14."

Karp made the announcement via Twitter on February 21.

“We had an episode of Drop The Mic this season with Jussie that you’ll now (correctly) never see,” he wrote. “But sadly it will shelve @clayaiken, WHO WAS A VERY GOOD RAPPER (at least for now).”

The Blast has obtained a clip of the episode which includes a “bail” punchline delivered by the disgraced Empire actor. As he was battling Orange Is The New Black actress Danielle Brooks, he spits a line about Brooks’ character being in jail.

“How long is your character gonna be in jail? If it gets you off the show, then I will pay your bail,” an almost prophetic line hinting at what was to come.

Smollett was arrested last month for felony disorderly conduct after he allegedly staged a hate-fueled attack on himself. He was reportedly unhappy with his salary on the hit FOX television series.

In the wake of his arrest, Empire producers also decided to cut Smollett from the show’s final two episodes of the season, explaining, “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Smollett’s Drop The Mic episode was expected to air on Thursday (March 6).

The charges against the engineer, Zachary Greenberg, 28, include three felony counts and one misdemeanor count, according to a criminal complaint obtained by Fox News.

The felony counts relate to assault and causing or intending bodily injury, and criminal threats. A misdemeanor count is related to vandalism, the complaint shows.

The charges come five days after police arrested Greenberg for allegedly attacking Hayden Williams, who is 26, while he was manning a recruitment table on campus for the conservative group Turning Point USA.

“We are pleased that the good investigative work of our police department has led to the filing of these charges,” Dan Mogoluf, assistant vice chancellor at UC-Berkeley, told Fox News. “The university believes that those who violate the free-speech rights of others must be held accountable and face the appropriate consequences.”

Greenberg is scheduled to be arraigned on Wednesday at the Wiley W. Manuel Courthouse in Oakland.

Williams, who is not a student, but rather a field representative for the conservative group The Leadership Institute, was helping Turning Point USA, which is launching a chapter on the campus, to hand out recruitment materials when Greenberg and another man approached him, he said to Fox News.

Williams said Greenberg took exception to pro-Trump signs, as well as one that criticized false hate-crime allegations, in an apparent reference to the case of actor Jussie Smollett, the TV actor accused of fabricating a racist and homophobic assault.

In a confrontation captured on cellphone video, the person Williams identified as Greenberg use vulgarities and taunted the activist. As Williams recorded him with his phone, the man attempted to grab it, knocked over the table and ripped signs.

As can be seen in another video, recorded by a student onlooker, the attacker then punches Williams several times, landing one direct blow to the head and causing injuries to his face, according to the campus police website. The two men who had approached Williams were gone by the time police arrived.

“That’s really the only way we can hold these people accountable, is by first and foremost, is documenting these incidents as they happen,” Williams told Fox News, “and that’s really one thing we teach at Leadership Institute, is just try and record everything, and don’t retaliate, because the left will use anything they can to try to distort the facts.”

Williams’ attorney, Harmeet K. Dhillon, expressed cautious optimism that the case would move forward. “We’re happy that the authorities seem to be taking this seriously, but we’ll suspend judgment on how seriously until we see the resolution of this case,” she said.

Dhillon attributed the skepticism to another case the Alameda County District Attorney’s office handled, in which a former community college professor and anti-fascist activist hit Trump supporters on the head with a bike lock at a UC-Berkeley rally in 2017. The professor, Eric Clanton, was originally charged with felonies for the attacks, which took place during a “free the speech” demonstration. The attack was captured on camera and posted on YouTube.

But Clanton worked out an agreement in which he pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault, and was sentenced to three years of probation, which will end on Aug. 8, 2021. Given that, Dhillon said, “we’ll see what happens” with charges against Greenberg.

“This is the very epitome of fascism,” Dhillon said, “the use of violence to silence your opponents and making people afraid of expressing their views.”

Much of the Feb. 19 incident was captured on the cellphone of the student onlooker, who told Fox News he was walking by when he noticed the altercation. That video went viral on social media.

Referring to the Berkeley incident, President Trump said Saturday he would put forth an executive order to promote free speech on college campuses.

“He took a punch for all of us,” Trump said of Williams. “And we could never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with Hayden, here’ the good news. He’s going to be a wealthy young man.”

Trump made the announcement at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where he also brought Williams up to the stage. Conservatives have accused many colleges of trying to suppress anti-liberal viewpoints.

Trump urged Williams to sue the man who assaulted him, but added, “he’s probably got nothing.” Williams told Trump that students would continue to defend him, as long as he defended them."

She said as much in a new episode of Yahoo News' Through Her Eyes, which premiered on the site Tuesday morning (March 5).

While there are pieces of evidence against Smollett, Latifah hasn't seen enough.

“Until somebody can show me some proof otherwise, I’m going with him,” she says in a clip from the interview. “The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet. And that's the guy I know.”

In January, Smollett told police that he was attacked by two white men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him before putting a noose around his neck. Chicago police initially called it a possible hate crime, but after a thorough investigation, they accused the actor of hiring two brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo. At least one of the actors had appeared in an episode of Empire.

Over the last few weeks, police have compiled pieces of evidence for their case, picking out footage of the two brothers buying red hats and other items said to be used in the alleged attack. Authorities have also pointed toward text messages Smollett exchanged with the brothers in the days leading up to the alleged attack as potential evidence.

On Feb. 21, Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a fake police report, which is Class 4 felony that is punishable by up to three years in prison. He posted bond and was released that same day. Smollett is due back in court on March 14.

Despite all of these developments, Latifah isn't ready to turn on Smollett.

“Until I can see some definitive proof—which I haven’t seen yet—then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise,” she reaffirms toward the end of the clip. “All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.”

Smollett was charged last month in Chicago with felony disorderly conduct. Police say the actor and musician falsely claimed to have been the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two men who shouted pro-Trump language. Smollett paid the men $3,500 to stage an altercation with him as a publicity-seeking move, according to authorities. The performer — who was cut from the final episodes of this season of “Empire” following his arrest — has maintained his innocence.

“The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet, and that’s just the guy I know,” Queen Latifah said when asked about Smollett.

“Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts said she thought there were “red flags” with Jussie Smollett’s story of being a hate crime victim ahead of her hyped-up sit-down with the “Empire” star last month and hesitated to even conduct the interview, describing it as a “no-win situation.”

""All I wanted was to get to the truth,"" Roberts said Monday during The Cut’s “How I Get It Done” event in Brooklyn, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ""All I wanted was to give the truth.""

Smollett claimed he was attacked in late January by MAGA hat-wearing thugs over his race and sexual orientation. Authorities now allege he hired two brothers to stage the attack because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"" on the Fox show and wanted to raise his public profile.

He has denied staging the attack.

Roberts said the “GMA” booking department had asked her about possibly interviewing Smollett shortly after the alleged attack, before police would allege it was a hoax.

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like 'I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,'” she said, according to Page Six. “I said I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up. And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

Roberts said that she was assured she would be able to ask him about the “red flags” and inconsistencies in his story.

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview,'” she said, according to Page Six.

However, Roberts called the interview a “no-win situation” as a gay black woman interviewing a gay black man: She said she was concerned that if she were “too hard” on Smollett, the LGBTQ community might feel like she didn’t buy his story; at the same time, she said: “If I’m too light on him, then it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.”

But ultimately, when the interview aired, it was eclipsed by the news that Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who worked with Smollett on “Empire,” were arrested in connection with the incident. They soon told police that Smollett paid them to carry out the attack and have since apologized for their alleged involvement.

“People are looking at the interview through the eyes of ‘How did you not know?'” she said, according to Page Six. “I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.”

Smollett turned himself in to police on Feb. 21, one day after he was charged with filing a false police report. He posted the $100,000 bail, and he faces a maximum of three years in prison if convicted."

Dhillon attributed the skepticism to another case the Alameda County District Attorney’s office handled, in which a former community college professor and anti-fascist activist hit Trump supporters on the head with a bike lock at a UC-Berkeley rally in 2017. The professor, Eric Clanton, was originally charged with felonies for the attacks, which took place during a “free the speech” demonstration. The attack was captured on camera and posted on YouTube.

But Clanton worked out an agreement in which he pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault, and was sentenced to three years of probation, which will end on Aug. 8, 2021. Given that, Dhillon said, “we’ll see what happens” with charges against Greenberg.

“This is the very epitome of fascism,” Dhillon said, “the use of violence to silence your opponents and making people afraid of expressing their views.”

Much of the Feb. 19 incident was captured on the cellphone of the student onlooker, who told Fox News he was walking by when he noticed the altercation. That video went viral on social media.

Referring to the Berkeley incident, President Trump said Saturday he would put forth an executive order to promote free speech on college campuses.

“He took a punch for all of us,” Trump said of Williams. “And we could never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with Hayden, here’ the good news. He’s going to be a wealthy young man.”

Trump made the announcement at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where he also brought Williams up to the stage. Conservatives have accused many colleges of trying to suppress anti-liberal viewpoints.

Trump urged Williams to sue the man who assaulted him, but added, “he’s probably got nothing.” Williams told Trump that students would continue to defend him, as long as he defended them."

On the roster: Stacey Abrams threatens presidential run - Hogan checks the temperature in Iowa - Ocasio-Cortez denies campaign cash allegations - McConnell can’t protect Trump emergency - Florida man + Molotov cocktails = Kicker



STACEY ABRAMS THREATENS PRESIDENTIAL RUN

NYT: “Pick a strategy Democrats are considering ahead of 2020, and Stacey Abrams’s narrow loss in the Georgia governor’s race serves either as a blueprint or a warning sign. … For Ms. Abrams, the answer is unequivocal: Her campaign turned out record numbers of black, Latino and Asian voters, and she also won a larger share of the white vote than President Barack Obama or scions of Georgia political royalty like Jason Carter and Michelle Nunn. … This, she argues, is a playbook Democrats should follow for 2020, whether or not she runs for president – a choice she is actively considering. ‘I need women of color, particularly black women, to understand that our achievements should not be diminished,’ she said, particularly that she came so close in a red state. She added, ‘Now I’m not saying I would be the best candidate, but I’m not going to dismiss it out of hand the way others do.’”



Bloomberg pens op-ed, will not run in 2020 - Bloomberg: “I know what it takes to run a winning campaign, and every day when I read the news, I grow more frustrated by the incompetence in the Oval Office. I know we can do better as a country. And I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election. But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field. There is another factor that has weighed heavily on my mind: the likelihood that our biggest national problems will worsen over the next two years. With a leader in the White House who refuses to bring the parties together, it will be nearly impossible for Congress to address the major challenges we face… I love our country too much to sit back and hope for the best as national problems get worse.”



Harris, Sanders got the best bounces - FiveThirtyEight: “When candidates run for president, they want to make a good first impression. … And so far, some candidates have had more successful kickoffs than others. … Out of the six candidates for whom we have both before and after data, Sen. Kamala Harris appears to have had the best campaign launch so far. Harris gained 8 percentage points between the poll the week before her Jan. 21 announcement and the poll the week after. And horse-race polling wasn’t the only indicator that Harris had an effective kickoff. Harris’s announcement also succeeded at getting more voters to see her in a positive light. … Sen. Bernie Sanders … had nearly as big of a bump as Harris. Sanders gained 6 points between the Feb. 11-17 poll and last week’s poll (he announced on Feb. 19). That’s especially impressive considering that he was already a well-known commodity.”



Hillary finally gets Shermanesque - USA Today: “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton definitively declared on Monday ‘I'm not running’ in the 2020 presidential election, again throwing cold water on the still smoldering rumors that she might go for a 2016 rematch against President Donald Trump. ‘I'm not running, but I'm going to keep working and speaking and standing up for what I believe,’ she said in an interview with News 12, a regional cable news network in New York. ‘I'm not going anywhere.’ Clinton has been an outspoken critic of her 2016 opponent and his administration's policies since her defeat.”



Bernie signs Democratic loyalty pledge - WaPo: “Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), a longtime independent, signed a pledge Tuesday saying he would seek the presidency as a Democrat and govern as a Democrat if elected. The move comes in response to a new rule from the Democratic National Committee that requires all candidates for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination to sign such a pledge — a change that some Sanders allies considered a swipe at the senator. Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and has said he will support the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020 no matter how the nominating contests go, has frustrated some in the party by remaining politically independent. He ran for president as a Democrat in 2016 but then sought reelection to his Senate seat from Vermont last year as an independent.”



Merkley’s message for Dems: There’s more at stake than the presidency - AP: “U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon has decided not to enter the increasingly crowded race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination after months of consideration. Merkley told The Associated Press the large field of Democratic contenders for the White House was not a major factor in his decision, nor was an Oregon law that prevents him from being on the ballot for more than one elected office in any given year. ‘I’ve never shied from a fight, and there’s nothing about the field that would make me reluctant to be there,’ Merkley said. Merkley, who planned to formally announce his intentions on Tuesday, said in a telephone interview that he decided he would be more effective running for his third term in the Senate than being a candidate for the presidency.”



Beto the blank slate - Politico: “It might be the biggest question lingering over [Beto] O’Rourke as he prepares for a likely run for the Democratic presidential nomination: Just what does he believe, actually? O’Rourke seems unwilling to place himself on his party’s conventional political spectrum. At the final town hall of his congressional career, the last of more than 100 such gatherings he held, O’Rourke was greeted in December at a local high school by cheerleaders, a mariachi band and supporters wearing T-shirts reading ‘Beto for President.’ In response to a question from POLITICO after the event, O’Rourke would not—or could not—answer if he considers himself a progressive Democrat. ‘I don’t know,’ he said. ‘I’m just, as you may have seen and heard over the course of the campaign, I’m not big on labels. I don’t get all fired up about party or classifying or defining people based on a label or a group. I’m for everyone.’”



Caitlin Flanagan: ‘The anger of Amy Klobuchar’ - The Atlantic: “What a disappointment all of this has been to those of us who had been so excited by [Amy] Klobuchar when we were introduced to her during the sudden-death round of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. You can be forgiven for not remembering those hearings, as they took place several years ago, before (inter alia) the Cohen testimony, the government shutdown, Caravans I, II, and III, Jussie Smollett, the state of emergency, people ‘unwilling to work,’ Virginia Is for Racists, Donald Trump breaking his 40-year winning streak of staying out of Vietnam, and the Oscars’ celebration of diversity coming to an abrupt halt when the wrong diversity picture got celebrated.”



HOGAN CHECKS THE TEMPERATURE IN IOWA

WaPo: “Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, one of the highest-profile Republicans open to running against President Trump, sounded notes Monday that candidates-in-waiting have long tried to hit in this first-caucus state. But he also signaled that he is in no rush to make up his mind about 2020. He said he was here to attend to National Governors Association business, not lay the groundwork for a campaign. ‘It currently makes no sense, with a president that has the kind of approval rating that he does in his own party,’ Hogan said in an interview. ‘Having said that, I’ve said things can change, and we don’t know what it might look like a few months from now.’ Variables such as the outcome of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s probe, Democratic talk of impeachment and the president’s fluctuating political standing are all potential factors in his decision, Hogan acknowledged. In the meantime, he’s taking things slowly.”



Mark Cuban keeping his 2020 options open - Fox News: “Mark Cuban won’t rule out taking a shot in 2020. The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner told Fox News it isn’t a slam dunk that he will get in the race, but it is something he is considering. ‘I said I’m not ruling it out,’ Cuban said via email. ‘But the tea leaves would have to align perfectly.’ The comments came after the ‘Shark Tank’ star spoke to the New York Daily News following the Mavs game against the Brooklyn Nets on Monday night. When asked if he was going to get off the bench and enter the political game, Cuban said: ‘I haven’t decided anything yet. We’ll see what happens. It all comes down to how things play out. There’s a lot of uncertainty with what’s going on with the Mueller report, there’s a lot of things that have to be figured out before we know how 2020 is going to play out.’”



THE RULEBOOK: STILL TRUE TODAY

“No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 10



TIME OUT: FASTELAVNBOLLERS FOR EVERYBODY!

Smithsonian: “Fat Tuesday, Carnaval, Shrove Tuesday, Fasching, Fastelavn—for as many different names there are for Mardi Gras, there’s just as many food-related traditions. Famous in the United States, of course, are king cake and beignets in New Orleans. Shrove Tuesday in Great Britain consists of a pancake feast. Fat Tuesday is on a Thursday in Poland, but their deep-fried treasure pączki is so renowned some just call it Pączki Day. Topped with powdered sugar, pączki are crispy on the outside and soft and thick in the middle with delicious jelly filling. Other countries have similar treats by different names. Lithuanians have spurgos, which are pretty similar—with the exception that they’re sometimes made with rum and raisins, or other times with cottage cheese. The Portuguese have malasadas, typically unfilled, but very sugary, balls sometimes formed into a unique triangular shape. Scandinavians, meanwhile, enjoy semla, or fastelavnboller, which are cream-filled baked buns.”

OCASIO-CORTEZ DENIES CAMPAIGN CASH ALLEGATIONS

Fox News: “New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday denied violating federal campaign law after a conservative government watchdog filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing the Democratic lawmaker and her chief of staff of being part of an ‘off-the-books operation’ to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on candidates last year. ‘There is no violation,’ Ocasio-Cortez exclusively told Fox News after landing Tuesday at Ronald Reagan National Airport. … The complaint was drafted by the Virginia-based National Legal and Policy Center. It accuses Ocasio-Cortez and Saikat Chakrabarti, her chief of staff, of funneling nearly $1 million in contributions from political action committees Chakrabarti established to private companies that he also controlled. The funds, the NLPC writes, were likely spent on campaign events for Ocasio-Cortez and other far-left Democratic candidates favored by Chakrabarti, who made his fortune in Silicon Valley and previously worked on Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. … Chakrabarti did not return a request for comment.”



Ocasio-Cortez says critics stoking violence against her - New Yorker: “‘It feels like an extra job,’ [Ocasio-Cortez] said of the attacks. ‘I’ve got a full-time job in Congress and then I moonlight as America’s greatest villain, or as the new hope. And it’s pretty tiring. I’m just a normal person. I knew that I was not going to be liked. I’m a Democrat. I’m a woman. I’m a young woman. A Latina. And I’m a liberal, a D.S.A. member,’ she said, referring to the Democratic Socialists of America. ‘I believe health care is a right and people should be paid enough to live. Those are offensive values to them. But this ravenous hysteria—it’s really getting to a level that is kind of out of control. It’s dangerous and even scary. I have days when it seems some people want to stoke just enough of it to have just enough plausible deniability if something happens to me.’”



House Dem in row over anti-Semitism resolution - NYT: “The decision by House Democratic leaders to put a resolution condemning anti-Semitism on the House floor Wednesday has touched off a furious debate between older House Democrats and a new breed of young liberal activists over whether Representative Ilhan Omar is being singled out for disparate treatment. The issue is pitting veteran Democrats like Representatives Eliot L. Engel, Nita M. Lowey and Jerrold Nadler — all of whom lead major House committees, and all of whom are Jewish — against Ms. Omar and left-leaning groups like Justice Democrats and IfNotNow, a movement led by young Jews to end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. It was prompted by comments and tweets from Ms. Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, that were characterized as anti-Semitic. A draft of the resolution being circulated on Capitol Hill does not name Ms. Omar. But there is little question it is aimed at her.”



Jonathan Chait: ‘Can anti-Semitism split Democrats like it split Labour?’ - Intelligencer: “Last week, Rachel Shabi, a left-of-center British journalist, warned American progressives that anti-Semitism could one day tear apart Democrats just as it is now doing to the Labour Party. When I read her essay, just ten days ago, it seemed fantastical. Today, after watching progressives floundering about in the wake of Ilhan Omar’s smearing of pro-Israel activism as a form of dual loyalty, Shabi’s diagnosis looks prescient. It can happen here.”



MCCONNELL CAN’T PROTECT TRUMP EMERGENCY

NYT: “Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, conceded on Monday that he could not stave off final passage of a resolution overturning President Trump’s national emergency declaration, setting up a rebuke to Mr. Trump amid signs that the president’s grip even on his own party in Congress may be slipping. With Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky joining three other Republicans — Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — in announcing he would support the measure, Democrats now have the 51 votes they need to secure passage and to force Mr. Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency. Mr. McConnell is exploring whether he can amend the House-passed resolution of disapproval, to send it back to the House and slow its trip to the president’s desk. Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski are both sponsors of a separate resolution, virtually identical to the House resolution, introduced in the Senate last week.”



Bon voyage, Stew - Politico: “Don Stewart, who was for more than a dozen years a top communications adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), is leaving the Hill after 22 years – all spent in the Senate. Stew, as he was known on the Hill, spent 13 years with McConnell, including his entire run as leader. He also worked for Georgia Sen. Paul Coverdell and Texas Sens. Phil Gramm and John Cornyn. Stew was also a bouncer, and he was in the Army – two jobs that might actually prepare you to work on the Hill. His last day is next Friday.”



[Ed. note: Stew, as he is known on the Hill, is fairly well the ideal flack. He never lies, he tells you the facts in the light most favorable to his team but doesn’t offer fanciful spin, he is well informed and has a presumption toward press access. He’s been great to work with over the years. I wish him every success and happiness outside of the institution.]



Feud between Scott and Gaetz gets ugly - Politico: “A feud between Rep. Matt Gaetz and Sen. Rick Scott has broken into the open, putting two of Donald Trump’s closest Florida allies at war with each other in a state that’s pivotal to the president’s reelection campaign. After simmering behind the scenes for months, the conflict came to a boil when Scott accused Gaetz of witness intimidation for threatening Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer-turned-congressional-informant, via Twitter. … The roots of the strife stretch back more than five years, to Tallahassee, when Scott served as governor. Back then, Gaetz was a state representative and Gaetz’s father, Don Gaetz, was the president of the Florida Senate who clashed with Scott. Two years later, in 2016, Don Gaetz was passed over to become president of the University of West Florida after Scott lobbied the selection committee in favor of another applicant.”

AUDIBLE: DON’T LET THEM STUFF YOU IN A LOCKER

“It is like high school – I just hope I’m better at it.” – Freshman Rep. Max Rose, D-N.Y., told Politico for an article about the House’s freshman cliques.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I must admit to being conflicted. I want the wall built...national emergency, crisis, disaster...call it what you will, our southern border must be secured. Pelosi and crew absolutely disgust me with the political games they play with our national security and have forced President Trump to declare this national emergency to do what must be done. But...I'm a strong believer in our Constitution and the arguments I've heard that this declaration is a constitutional power overreach by the President are troubling. Also, if granted, it would set a precedent that could be abused in the future. Can you enlighten me as to what should be done and/or what you think will happen?” – Neil Klapthor, Evans, Ga.



[Ed. note: In arguing against the resolution of disapproval now headed for passage in the Senate, President Trump said that Republicans should be unconcerned about the precedent it would set for future abuses of power by Democratic presidents since “they’re going to do it anyway.” But if that were so, it would be even more imperative for Republicans in Congress to hold the line now. The less this issue is about the specific policy and partisan self-interest, the better the legal argument Congress will have. There’s a case to be made that the president’s declaration is legal but not constitutional. And since there’s never been a declaration like this one to repurpose domestic funds specifically, expressly denied by Congress on multiple occasions, there’s a chance that the courts may consider the larger question of the law’s validity. Either way, this is an important legal fight to have. And I think it’s even more important that our impossibly weak Congress find ways to push back against the decades-long slouch toward executive power. That has nothing to do with my feelings about the issue of a couple of extra billion for border security, but rather about the deeper consideration of a system that’s gotten out of whack.]



“Most interesting report. My wife and I have paw paw most days as a lunchtime dessert... delicious! My doctor father told me that paw paw seeds contained pepsin. It remains very popular here in The West Indies and is widely available in supermarkets. Not generally known is that the paw paw tree may be ‘male’ or ‘female’ … the male tree will never produce fruit.” – Eric de Verteuil, West Moorings, Trinidad



[Ed. note: My jealousy knows no bounds, Mr. de Verteuil! Not only do you live in a riotously, astonishingly beautiful place (current temperature, 88 degrees, steady breeze, low humidity) but you get to eat one of my favorite things in the world each and every day. Though as a West Virginian, perhaps I love paw paws so much because they are available so briefly. You have to wait until summer, when hot nights have finally crept into the mountains. And before the first frost they are already gone. Maybe the waiting and the short season makes them taste sweeter. But if I had such easy access to ripe paw paws, I promise that I would keep my ice cream maker in overdrive churning out pints!]

FLORIDA MAN + MOLOTOV COCKTAILS = KICKER

WFTV: “An Orange County [Fla.] man is under arrest after allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at his own vehicle inside of an impound lot, according to an arrest report. ‘He came back and started throwing gas cocktail bombs over the fence on his own car,’ said car lot owner Darnell Adams. An arrest report says the suspect, Ayub Abdulrahman, came to get his car back after it was impounded and set it on fire instead. … Adams said he was going to hand over the keys because Abdulrahman had already paid almost $300 to get this car out of the impound lot, but instead of it going home the burned-out car was stuck behind crime scene tape. … ‘I didn't even own it anymore. He was getting it out,’ Adams said. ‘20 minutes. If he had waited twenty minutes, he would've been able to drive away in his car.’ … Adams said his mechanic was able to put the fire out with an extinguisher.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“Some will protest that in a world with so much human suffering, it is something between eccentric and obscene to mourn a dog. I think not. After all, it is perfectly normal, indeed, deeply human to be moved when nature presents us with a vision of great beauty.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing for Time Magazine on June 10, 2003.

Morgan'],https://d3ebobe8l15pwo.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Citizen-Letters-3.jpg,"['radical', 'leftwing', 'democrat', 'political', 'stop', 'party', 'radicals', 'trump', 'american', 'radicalization', 'halt', 'america', 'democrats']","The radicals in the Democrat Party have declared that if you do not agree with their radical agenda and you do not share their insatiable appetite for identity politics, you are a racist.

You are a racist if you are a Republican, conservative or independent, regardless of your race, gender, religious belief, or sexual preference. According to the radicals on the left, bigots and racists elected Donald J. Trump. Well, I voted for him.

The radical element in the Democrat Party has perfected the art of accusing others of what they themselves are guilty of. They are the perpetrators of racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia and on and on. Latest examples:

Brett Kavanaugh (now Justice Kavanaugh) was unjustly attacked by the radical left-wing Democrats throughout his confirmation hearing despite zero evidence that he had violated his accuser.

Governor Justin Edward Fairfax of Virginia was asked to resign by the radical left-wing Democrats without being given due process because it was politically expedient to toss him under the bus.

Covington students were falsely and fiercely attacked by the radical left-wing Democrats and their cohorts in the media as well as by a host of “fantasy islanders” aka celebrities.

The left-wing Democrats along with their 2020 presidential candidates believed the actor Jussie Smollett, and blamed President Trump. They called his attack a “modern day lynching.” They were amazingly speechless when it was revealed that Smollett reportedly staged his hate crime assault. Newsflash: he lied.

The radical left-wing Democrats demanded that Virginia’s Governor Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring resign for wearing blackface until the story broke about Lt. Gov. Fairfax. If the top three were to resign, the governor’s seat would have been filled by the Speaker of the House, a Republican. That one fact forced the radical left-wing Democrats and the media to suddenly execute a hasty retreat.

Ilahan Abdullahi Omar, the freshman congresswoman, made anti-Semitic comments and was given a pass despite her well-publicized hatred of Jews and Israel.

The left-wing radicals of the Democrat Party are die-hard hypocrites. They even use Jesus Christ as a political prop when it fits their political narrative. In defense of their support for illegal immigration Chuck Schumer tearfully said, “Jesus said, we must take care of the poor and the less fortunate.” Wait!

This is the party that did the following:

• voted God off their platform at their 2012 national convention.

• funded abortions with taxpayer dollars.

• most recently supported the killing of the born: infanticide.

How in the world can American citizens who are professed Christians become (let alone remain) paid members and registered supporters of this left-wing, progressive, socialist anti-Christ party? To me this raises one major question: Why?

I encourage all peace-loving, law-abiding Americans to resist the “resist movement.” The elected officials/representatives in Washington took an oath to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution and the American people. Unfortunately, this is not the priority of Nancy Pelosi and the radicals in the Democrat Party. Their main focus is to resist President Trump even if it means sacrificing the safety and security of our nation.

We can put a stop to this madness. We, the American people, can help the President put a stop to illegal immigration; the flow of deadly drugs/opioids and sex and human trafficking. These unlawful and outrageous actions are happening every day. We can stop this by voting the radical Democrats out in 2020.

I am calling on every American patriot to join us now! Do not hesitate … Do not wait until it’s too late. Political power belongs to the people, not to the political elites who have their own political/social and economic agenda.

Happening inconveniently as it did in the midst of Black History Month, the story of his alleged mugging by racist white homophobes dominated the news cycle for weeks. While the tale of a hate crime perpetrated against an African American gay man seemed plausible given we are a nation mired in regime-inspired hate, it has since unraveled. And, while the case remains unresolved, even the most ardent Smollett supporters have begun to concede he may well have orchestrated a hoax. As a gay black man, Smollett had become known as an activist, but now his potential as a positive role model has been foolishly squandered. The act could end his career, but the greater collateral damage on the LGBTQ community, and LGBTQ people of color in particular, may be immeasurable.

For all the damage done, it shouldn’t be lost on anyone that the art of the hoax is deeply ingrained in human nature as a tactic to achieve whatever desired outcome. In fact, the “boy who cried wolf” tale goes back two-and-a-half millennia to fabulist Aesop, credited with its earliest telling. That certainly doesn’t excuse Smollett, but he hasn’t set a precedent, either.

There’s Olympian Ryan Lochte, of course, who pulled a similar stunt in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the 2016 Olympics, claiming muggers disguised as police attacked him and fellow athletes. The 12-time Olympic medalist suffered certain consequences for his “cry-wolf” escapade, losing lucrative sponsorships and receiving a 10-year suspension from competitive events. Yet it seems the handsome, all-American jock is already on the road to rehabilitation. He recently appeared on the reality show “Big Brother—Celebrity Edition” and it’s been suggested he may compete in the 2020 Olympics after all.

The differences in the two cases are clear. The most obvious is the straight white Olympian’s status as international icon versus the actor’s comparatively limited fame. And then, there are Smollett’s dual fatal flaws of being both black and gay that deny him the ready forgiveness given to the affable Lochte.

Actually, both their hoaxes are mere bagatelles compared to the history of lynchings of African Americans based on false accusations, like those of 14-year-old George Stinney Jr. in 1944 or Emmett Till in 1955. Today’s ever-popular “feared for my life” or “gay/trans panic” legal defenses still easily acquit murderers of people of color and LGBTQs.

Speaking of mendacity, lies by the U.S. president, now documented at more than 8,000, coupled with hate-crime hoaxes articulated in Republican fear-mongering rants about “changing demographics” or the “MAGA” catchphrase itself, recently led conservative commentator David Brookes to dub their effect “morally numbing.”

Meanwhile, speaking of rehabilitating the morally numb, the Baraboo boys who gave the Nazi salute in a class photo and lied about it, have since taken a field trip to a museum to learn about the genocide of the Jews. I’m sure Remedial Holocaust Studies look better on a college application than membership in the Hitler Youth Glee Club. But then, I suppose that depends on the college."

“She can run it when it is about something else, but speak up about injustice, Dolly Parton. Speak up. And speak out. Defend women, and don’t just do it in a little song. Speak up.”

Dolly Parton, 73, recently mentioned the #MeToo movement in an interview with Sky News.

“I think there’s always gonna be a long way to go. It’s just a work in progress, as life itself is, especially for women in the workplace. So I think that’s why we’re here now, with the #MeToo movement,” she said.

Of her own experience with sexual harassment, she said, “I never found myself in any of those positions or I tried to stay out of those positions, and if I found myself in that — I was lucky I had a great personality and a great sense of humor that I could joke my way out of a lot of it. And then if I couldn’t, I have a temper and backbone so I could get out of it some other way.”

Dolly Parton was not the only public figure her sister targeted in her recent interview.

She also went after actresses Jane Fonda and Meryl Streep.

“In the same way that Jane Fonda and people who have been in Hollywood all these years and never said a word — like Meryl Streep was all big buddies with Harvey Weinstein until he got busted,” she said. “And then she kinda came around to say, ‘Well, you know, that’s terrible’ … Well, why didn’t you speak up when it came down? You knew it? All these women just didn’t speak up because they’re afraid they’re gonna mess with their fan base. I think women would be more apt to respect you if you would speak up.”

She then went on to praise former first lady Michelle Obama.

“That’s why I was so happy to have people in our government like Michelle Obama, who has always been such an inspiration to the younger generation of women. I believe we finally have a chance here. We have an open window. Don’t let it be closed by keeping your mouth shut,” she said.

Griffin made headlines back in May 2017 when she posed with a severed head meant to look like President Trump, presenting it to the camera the way an ISIS member would.

The gruesome image immediately drew outrage on social media, while Trump called the photo “sick” and said Griffin “should be ashamed of herself.”

She even lost her CNN gig as a result.

Her former New Year’s Eve co-host, Anderson Cooper, not exactly a fan of Trump, said even he was “appalled” by the photo shoot.

However, Griffin feels that other celebrities, such as Johnny Depp and Snoop Dogg, haven’t been vilified to the same extent for similar attacks on the president.

“I feel a lot of this is because I’m a 58-year-old woman. I’m a successful stand-up comedian, which flies in the face of everything Trump and his folks believe,” Griffin told Variety in a new interview. “I think my impression is they’re just offended by the audacity that I want to continue to work and be successful and I’m a self-made woman.”

The liberal comedian recently embarked on a comedy tour named “Laugh Your Head Off” and has a self-funded film coming out; but she continues to have a hard time finding the work she feels she deserves.

“Even despite her touring success, every executive in town regarded her as an unemployable comic who’d crossed the line. She tried to shop around a comedy special, but Netflix and HBO passed,” Variety’s Ramien Setoodeh wrote. “She wanted to do a reality show about what it was like to have her First Amendment rights attacked by the president. That idea was met with crickets.”

“I’m very acutely aware I’m tied to that photo for the rest of my life,” she said. “People confront me in the street. They think I’m ISIS.”

She claims to “have a body of work that speaks for itself,” featuring two Emmys and a Grammy, and is perplexed as to why Netflix won’t give her a comedy deal.

Griffin told Variety she is essentially blacklisted by Hollywood as a result of her various controversies, but added that her gender and age also have something to do with it.

“There really aren’t very many well-known female comedians over 50,” she said. “And I think some of [the executives] are gobsmacked, going, ‘What’s this chick still doing around?’”

After the bloody photo made headlines, Trump and first lady Melania Trump released statements condemning the attack on their family.

Trump added the picture took a toll on his 11-year-old son Barron as the first lady questioned Griffin’s mental health. The far-left comedian initially apologized, but later recanted the apology.

Now, she is “very upset” that networks passed on her “genius” idea of hosting a special with porn star Stormy Daniels, but is optimistic that her fortune will change eventually despite the fallout over her controversial photo shoot, noting that “it’s been over a year-and-a-half” since the incident.

“I’m very acutely aware I’m tied to that photo for the rest of my life,” she said. “People confront me in the street. They think I’m ISIS. And then it becomes funny. At the moment it’s scary, and then I go home and go, ‘OK, really?’ I’ve just learned to accept that. I wish I could go the [Colin] Kaepernick route, where this ends in me getting a $100 billion Nike contract.”

Meanwhile, Griffin has emerged as an outspoken critic of Trump on social media and is often a target of his supporters.

The president’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has been known to mock her on Twitter, but she has a theory about who is spearheading the rivalry.

“Don Jr. doesn’t take a p*** without asking Daddy first,” she said.

Robin Roberts on Monday revealed that she saw ""red flags"" in Jussie Smollett’s story and was subsequently hesitant about interviewing the Empire star on ABC's Good Morning America. The sit-down, which aired Feb. 14, was Smollett's first televised interview since his alleged hate crime attack and was broadcast one week before Smollett would go on to be charged with federal disorderly conduct for falsifying a police report.

The GMA anchor took a moment during her solo panel at The Cut's first daylong ""How I Get It Done"" event to share details about the high-profile interview, including the details of how the ABC get unfolded and whether she believed Smollett during the process.

""All I wanted was to get to the truth,"" Roberts told the intimate crowd, including The Hollywood Reporter, that had gathered at 1 Hotel Brooklyn. ""All I wanted was to give the truth.""

While discussing details of the interview, which was shot two days prior to its airing, Roberts explained that the GMA booking department had initially reached out to her about sitting down with Smollett. Talks about the possible interview began shortly after the Empire star claimed he was attacked on a Chicago street in late January.

It was in those early internal conversations where Roberts first voiced her reluctance. ""I'll be completely honest, I said, 'I don't know if I'm going to do the interview or not,'"" she said. ""Let's just wait and see, let's see if more information comes in.""

There was rising speculation over Smollett's account at the time, but it wasn't until hours after the interview aired that a report hit that brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo (who are now witnesses in the Chicago Police Department's case) were allegedly paid by Smollett to stage the attack. The narrative around Smollett began to significantly shift, but the interview was already locked.

Roberts pointed to comments made by Smollett during a Los Angeles concert in the days following his alleged attack as another key moment where she questioned speaking with the actor. She was adamant that interviewing Smollett made ""no sense"" if he was just going to ""lawyer up"" or refuse to be candid.

Roberts clarified to THR that her decision to talk with Smollett was contingent upon him sharing details that hadn’t been previously reported, which would make the interview newsworthy. ""If there wasn't going to be anything new, I didn't really want to do it,"" she said.

It was after those internal GMA conversations that Smollett reached out, ""outraged by people making assumptions about whether it happened or not,"" Roberts told THR and the crowd. According to the GMA anchor, Smollett's team said that the actor was OK with being challenged on what Roberts saw as ""red flags,"" but that he'd also say things he hadn’t already said elsewhere.

""I'm like — as a journalist and as a newsperson, this is his right,"" Roberts said. ""He's going on the record for the first time. Yes, I'll do the interview.""

Roberts noted that her GMA team went through the police report and conducted other research to prepare for the interview, which was originally set for 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 12, but was ultimately pushed back several hours due to the actor's filming schedule. Roberts admitted during the panel that she wasn’t sure how it was going to go or how Smollett was going to react, but that she consciously worked to be as neutral as possible. She also was aware of her own identity as a gay black woman and how reporting on Smollett, a gay black man, might be perceived.

""He's saying that it was a hate crime,"" Roberts said. ""So if I'm too hard on him, then people in my LGBTQ community are going, 'Oh, you don't believe him.' If I'm too light on him, then it's like, 'Oh, because you are in the community, you're giving him a pass.' So it was, like, it was a no-win situation for me.""

On Feb. 25, four days after Smollett's arrest, Roberts did another GMA sit-down, this time with Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who revealed additional details about the department's ongoing investigation. Smollett maintains his innocence and returns to court this month.

Responding to criticisms to her Smollett interview, including that she was too soft on the actor, Roberts admitted that she would have gone farther with her questioning of the actor if she’d had more of the details that eventually came to light before the segment aired. ""It was hurtful, some of the things that were said. I'll be honest,"" said Roberts. ""Because I pride myself on being fair. I know how much work went into being balanced about what to ask, to challenge him on certain things.""

She added, ""Had I had that information or what the brothers were alleging — heck, yeah, I would have asked that. But it aired that morning [and] we taped it two days ahead of time."""

The media all but forgot about them after the alleged Jussie Smollett hoax began to dominate the news. But, the truth remains that the top Democrats in Virginia are dealing with blackface conspiracies and sexual assault allegations. Gov. Ralph Northam apologized for a racist photo in his medical school yearbook that showed two individuals wearing a KKK hood and blackface. After that, Attorney General Mark Herring admitted he did blackface too. Then, two women accused Lieutenant Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual harassment. All three men have rejected calls to resign.

With that in mind, the Virginia Democrats had to gall to accuse their Old Dominion counterparts of ""dividing"" citizens.

Before admitting to his own experience with blackface, the hypocritical Herring had actually demanded the governor resign. After a month, he is now explaining that's not so much because Northam may have done blackface, but because he flip flopped on his apology.

""The governor had said he was in the [blackface] photo, apologized for it,"" Herring said on Tuesday. ""The next day, the governor came out with a different and contradictory account, and that was when there was an erosion of trust. That was what my [resignation] statement was about. . . . It was really about the public trust. I would hold myself to the same standard."""

It was only a few hours after the interview aired that investigators accused Smollett of staging the attack.

Chicago police have since charged him with filing a false report, accusing Smollett of orchestrating the incident because he was disappointed with his salary.

Roberts said she was hesitant to interview Smollett in the first place, and felt like the interview was a ""no-win situation"" since it wouldn't look good if she pressed him too hard, Page Six reported.

""Good Morning America"" host Robin Roberts said Monday that she was hesitant to interview Jussie Smollett last month after he said he was the victim of a hate crime attack.

Speaking at The Cut's ""How I Get It Done"" event in Brooklyn, Roberts said that when the story first broke, she thought it best to wait and see what new information came in before interviewing the ""Empire"" star.

""I'll be completely honest, I said, 'I don't know if I'm going to do the interview or not,'"" she said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ""Let's just wait and see, let's see if more information comes in.""

Roberts said she finally agreed to do the interview when Smollett's representatives said he planned to give new information, and promised her that she could ask him about ""red flags"" in his story. She said Smollett wanted to do the interview to combat rising speculation about his story.

""They said, 'He wants to say things that he has not said,' and I'm like, 'As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he's going to go on record for the first time, yes I'll do the interview,'"" she said, according to Page Six.

But she said the fact that she was a gay woman made her a less-than-ideal interviewer for Smollett.

""I'm a black gay woman, he's a black gay man. He's saying that there's a hate crime, so if I'm too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, 'You don't believe a brother.' If I'm too light on him, it's like, 'Oh, because you are in the community, you're giving him a pass,'"" she said, according to Page Six. ""It was a no-win situation for me.""

The interview was filmed on February 12, but aired two days later. Within hours of the interview airing, news reports emerged that two Nigerian brothers had accused Smollett of paying them to attack him. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson later said Smollett orchestrated the attack because he was upset about his ""Empire"" salary.

""People are looking at the interview through the eyes of 'How did you not know?'"" Roberts said, according to Page Six. ""I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.""

She went on to say that it was ""one of the most challenging interviews I've ever had to do.""

The _Empire _actor has been charged with filing a false police report after claiming he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in January and denied staging the assault.

She said: ""The guy I've seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who's very kind and who's always been cool and sweet. And that's just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof - which I haven't seen yet - then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.""

But the STAR actress admitted she doesn't know what to make of the scandal, but she hopes everything works out eventually.

Speaking to Zainab Salbi on Yahoo News' Through Her Eyes, she added: ""I don't even know what to make of it. All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.""

Following Smollett's arrest, it was revealed his character, Jamal Lyon, would be written out of the final two episodes of season five of Empire to prevent further disruption to filming.

Producers including Lee Daniels and Danny Strong said in a statement last month: ""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our _Empire _family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of _Jamal _from the final two episodes of the season.""

The 36-year-old actor has been praised by his legal team as a young man of impeccable character in a statement that hit out at the way the investigation has been handled.

The lawyers said in a statement: ""Today we witnessed an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing."""

Good Morning America host Robin Roberts who sat down with the Empire actor almost three weeks ago shared details about the interview that she describes as one of the “most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do.”

Speaking at The Cut’s “How I Get It Done” event at the 1 Hotel Bridge on Monday (March 4) Roberts explains she was initially unsure if she wanted to do the interview in the first place. She decided to go through with the sit down after they promised her she could speak about the “red flags” in Jussie’s story and that she would get new information from Smollett.

Roberts breaks down how she felt the interview was a “no-win” situation for her being a Black gay woman as she tried to be “neutral” as possible during the sit-down and that she would have pressed Smollett about the arrest of the two Nigerian men had she known.

Via Page Six:

“I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up. And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview.”

“I sit down with him, and I don’t know what he’s going to say. Following up [about how] he couldn’t believe people didn’t believe him, well I go, ‘You’re out 2 o’clock in the morning, you’re getting a sandwich, [and] you won’t give up your phone.’”

“People are looking at the interview through the eyes of ‘How did you not know? I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.”

“I pride myself in being fair, I know how much work went into being balanced about what had happened and to challenge him on certain things.”

If this all pans out to be a hoax after the dust settles, we would understand if Roberts wants to issue Jussie Smollett a fade for wasting her time.

Jussie Smollett was the victim of a real attack (verbally, at least) when he suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of ""Orange of the New Black"" star Danielle Brooks during his appearance on ""Drop the Mic"" and The Blast has a look at the pulled episode.

During the course of the rap battle, Brooks spit a few ""Empire"" jokes (""I watch 'Empire,' I got questions though / How are you Terrence Howard's son when you can't hustle or flow?"") and made a crack about how Smollett proves ""not all gay men can sing and dance well.""

As for Smollett, he got a few good jabs in but he weirdly forecasted his own fate when he dropped a line about Brooks' ""OITNB"" character being in jail, rapping, ""How long is your character gonna be in jail? If it gets you off the show, then I will pay your bail.""

But Brooks came back and capped off her final verse with an epic ""Lion King"" dig and was crowned the winner by Method Man.

""Drop the Mic"" — which airs Wednesdays at 10:00 PM on TNT — decided not to air the episode when Jussie Smollett was arrested on February 21 on charges of filing a false police report.

Smollett was released later that day after posting $100,000 bail.

His legal team released a statement after the charges were announced, saying, “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

""Empire"" producers decided to cut Smollett from the show's final two episodes of the season, explaining, ""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.""

In his interview with Roberts, Smollett said he was ""pissed off"" at assertions his claims were a hoax — but that's exactly what Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said they were the day Smollett was arrested about a week later.



Roberts discussed what led to her agreeing to interview Smollett and if she believed him during a panel discussion at an event titled, ""How I Get It Done,"" the Hollywood Reporter said.

She said she consciously worked to be as neutral as possible, the outlet said — and was aware of her identity as a gay black woman and how it would come across as she interviewed Smollett, who's also black and gay.

""He's saying that it was a hate crime,"" Roberts said, according to the outlet. ""So if I'm too hard on him, then people in my LGBTQ community are going, 'Oh, you don't believe him.' If I'm too light on him, then it's like, 'Oh, because you are in the community, you're giving him a pass.' So ... it was a no-win situation for me.""

More from The Hollywood Reporter:



Responding to criticisms to her Smollett interview, including that she was too soft on the actor, Roberts admitted that she would have gone farther with her questioning of the actor if she'd had more of the details that eventually came to light before the segment aired. ""It was hurtful, some of the things that were said. I'll be honest,"" said Roberts. ""Because I pride myself on being fair. I know how much work went into being balanced about what to ask, to challenge him on certain things.""

Eventually, brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo told police Smollett paid them to stage the attack — which the actor said involved two masked men who punched and kicked him, put a noose around his neck, poured a liquid on him that smelled like bleach, and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" at him, which is a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Smollett has continued to deny the allegations.

""Had I had that information or what the brothers were alleging — heck, yeah, I would have asked that,"" Roberts said, according to the outlet. ""But it aired that morning [and] we taped it two days ahead of time.""

Reluctance

Roberts also said she was reluctant to conduct the interview amid speculation that Smollett wasn't telling the truth.

""I'll be completely honest, I said, 'I don't know if I'm going to do the interview or not,'"" she said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ""Let's just wait and see, let's see if more information comes in.""

She added to the outlet that doing the interview was contingent upon Smollett sharing new details: ""If there wasn't going to be anything new, I didn't really want to do it.""

""All I wanted was to get to the truth,"" Roberts added, the Hollywood Reporter said. ""All I wanted was to give the truth.""

After Smollett agreed to be candid and share new details, Roberts told the outlet she agreed to conduct the interview.

""I'm like — as a journalist and as a newsperson, this is his right,"" she said, according to the Hollywood Reporter. ""He's going on the record for the first time. Yes, I'll do the interview.""

Robin Roberts is once again speaking out about her controversial interview with actor Jussie Smollett.

In case you forget, the GMA host interviewed Smollett on February 14, shortly after the Empire star reported being the victim of a homophobic, racist hate crime. It was also right around the time questions began to emerge regarding his account of the assault.

Just two days later, Chicago Police arrested two men who claimed Smollett paid them to stage the attack. Then a grand jury subsequently indicted the actor for filing a false police report.

As the situation became clearer, Roberts came under fire for not grilling Smollett harder on his account of the assault. Now, she is reflecting on the interview with frustration.

“I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man,” she told her GMA co-hosts this week. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother.’ If I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.”

“It was a no-win situation for me,” Roberts said. “I pride myself in being fair. I know how much work went into being balanced about what had happened and to challenge him on certain things.”

Roberts went on to explain that she had hesitations over doing the interview, but she agreed to do it after Smollett claimed he would reveal thereto unspoken information regarding the attack.

She further complained that the actor arrived more than two hours late for their recording session.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court March 14, and has been released from jail on bail. Prosecutors allege that he faked the attack, as well as several threatening letters mailed to the Empire offices as a way to boost his profile for a pay raise.

Though Smollett denies any involvement in the attack, producers have cut his role from the remaining episodes of Empire this season.

Actress and musician Queen Latifah appears to still believe Smollett, despite him being charged for allegedly filing a false police report. In an interview for Yahoo News’ “Through Her Eyes” program, Latifah said bluntly, “until somebody can show me some proof otherwise, I’m going with him.”

Latifah at first scoffed at the questions, saying she was “not about to discuss Jussie Smollett,” before stating that she required more proof that he was guilty.

“The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet and that’s just the guy I know,” Latifah continued. “So, until I can see some definitive proof, which I haven’t seen yet, then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.”

Latifah was then asked by host Zain about the racial dynamic involved in the Smollett case. The actress responded that the case started with Smollett’s accusation that two “white guys” wearing “Make America Great Again” hats attacked him, but that now she doesn’t know what to make of the situation.

“I hope, you know, everything works out in the end and, you know, everyone basically comes out unscathed,” she said.

One can respect Latifah’s hesitance to believing her friend orchestrated a hoax, but at some point the evidence has to be accepted.

Latifah said she had not seen any definitive proof that Smollett made the accusation up, but all the evidence points in that direction.

Smollett initially said two white men wearing MAGA hats physically assaulted him while yelling racial and homophobic epithets at him. They allegedly tied a “noose” around his neck and poured a chemical on him that smelled like bleach. They also allegedly yelled, “This is MAGA country.” He said the whole attack happened in Chicago at around 2 a.m. while he was returning to his friend’s apartment from a Subway restaurant.

The accusation on its face strained credulity. One would have to believe that two white men knew enough about the show “Empire” to be able to recognize Smollett and troll through the streets of Chicago during a polar vortex carrying rope and bleach hoping to recognize him or someone else to attack. It also requires the belief that at least two people in Chicago believe the city is a bastion of support for President Donald Trump (narrator: It’s not).

But the evidence against Smollett is even more damning. The two men who bought the rope and the red hats (they were not MAGA hats) and carried out the attacks were of Nigerian descent, not white. They were former associates of Smollett and told police the “Empire” actor paid them for the attack. They even produced a check for $3,500 from Smollett they say was money to pay them for staging the attack.

It’s possible, if one really wants to believe Smollett at this point, that the two former associates decided to attack Smollett for some reason after he paid them $3,500 for a “5 week Nutrition/Workout program,” as he wrote in the memo line of the check. That, too, strains credulity as nothing was stolen from Smollett during the alleged attack.

Perhaps this means Latifah believes in the presumption of innocence no matter the evidence or early reporting. That’s a healthy skepticism, but it seems unlikely in this case."

“The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet,” Queen Latifah said of Smollett in an interview with Yahoo News.

“And that’s just the guy I know,” she added. “So until I can see some definitive proof–which I haven’t seen yet–then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.”

Queen Latifah, real name Dana Elaine Owens, has been outspoken about racism in America before.

“I don’t care how much money or things I have, or Puff has or Missy has,” she said in 2016. “If I go outside and try to hail a cab and he passes me for the white woman standing right there, that racism is still alive and kicking. And we have to change that.”

“And I’m not blaming the white lady, she needed a cab too … I’m just saying we got to change this attitude.”

However, Chicago police said last month that Smollett took advantage of anger over racism to stage a fake hate attack against himself.

“This announcement today recognizes that Empire actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said last month.

“I’m left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?”

Smollett was indicted in February after allegedly staging an attack against himself. Chicago police said that the 36-year-old falsely led police to believe that his “attackers” were white."

During an event in Brooklyn on Monday, “Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts reflected on her interview with “Empire” star Jussie Smollett, who claimed to be the victim of a hate crime.

It was only a few hours after the interview aired that investigators accused Smollett of staging the attack.

Chicago police have since charged him with filing a false report, accusing Smollett of orchestrating the incident because he was disappointed with his salary.

Roberts said she was hesitant to interview Smollett in the first place, and felt like the interview was a “no-win situation” since it wouldn’t look good if she pressed him too hard,Page Six reported.

“Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts said Monday that she was hesitant to interview Jussie Smollett last month after he said he was the victim of a hate crime attack.

Speaking at The Cut’s “How I Get It Done” event in Brooklyn, Roberts said that when the story first broke, she thought it best to wait and see what new information came in before interviewing the “Empire” star.

“I’ll be completely honest, I said, ‘I don’t know if I’m going to do the interview or not,'” she said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “Let’s just wait and see, let’s see if more information comes in.”

Roberts said she finally agreed to do the interview when Smollett’s representatives said he planned to give new information, and promised her that she could ask him about “red flags” in his story. She said Smollett wanted to do the interview to combat rising speculation about his story.

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said,’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview,'” she said, according to Page Six.

But she said the fact that she was a gay woman made her a less-than-ideal interviewer for Smollett.

“I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man. He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother.’ If I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass,'” she said, according to Page Six. “It was a no-win situation for me.”

The interview was filmed on February 12, but aired two days later. Within hours of the interview airing, news reports emerged that two Nigerian brothers had accused Smollett of paying them to attack him. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson later said Smollett orchestrated the attack because he was upset about his “Empire” salary.

“People are looking at the interview through the eyes of ‘How did you not know?'” Roberts said, according to Page Six. “I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.”

Producers including Lee Daniels and Danny Strong said in a statement last month: ""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our 'Empire' family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""

The 36-year-old actor has been praised by his legal team as a ""young man of impeccable character"" in a statement that hit out at the way the investigation has been handled.

The lawyers said in a statement: ""Today we witnessed an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing."""

""Good Morning America"" host Robin Roberts said Monday that she was hesitant to interview Jussie Smollett last month after he said he was the victim of a hate crime attack.

Speaking at The Cut's ""How I Get It Done"" event in Brooklyn, Roberts said that when the story first broke, she thought it best to wait and see what new information came in before interviewing the ""Empire"" star.

""I'll be completely honest, I said, 'I don't know if I'm going to do the interview or not,'"" she said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ""Let's just wait and see, let's see if more information comes in.""

Roberts said she finally agreed to do the interview when Smollett's representatives said he planned to give new information, and promised her that she could ask him about ""red flags"" in his story. She said Smollett wanted to do the interview to combat rising speculation about his story.

""They said, 'He wants to say things that he has not said,' and I'm like, 'As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he's going to go on record for the first time, yes I'll do the interview,'"" she said, according to Page Six.

But she said the fact that she was a gay woman made her a less-than-ideal interviewer for Smollett.

""I'm a black gay woman, he's a black gay man. He's saying that there's a hate crime, so if I'm too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, 'You don't believe a brother.' If I'm too light on him, it's like, 'Oh, because you are in the community, you're giving him a pass,'"" she said, according to Page Six. ""It was a no-win situation for me.""

The interview was filmed on February 12, but aired two days later.

Johnson later said Smollett orchestrated the attack because he was upset about his ""Empire"" salary.

""People are looking at the interview through the eyes of 'How did you not know?'"" Roberts said, according to Page Six. ""I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.""

The lead guitarist from Jack Black’s band in the movie “School of Rock” is facing felony charges in Florida for allegedly stealing guitars.

Joey Gaydos Jr., who starred as a child alongside Black in the 2003 film, faces felony larceny and grand theft charges after he was caught allegedly trying to steal guitars and an amplifier four times over the last five weeks, according to TMZ.

Police claim that Gaydos, 27, would go to music stores, ask to test out expensive guitars, then leave without paying and attempt to get money for the instruments at pawn shops.

According to police, he’d been caught trying to pawn an $800 blue Les Paul Epiphone Prophecy, a $699 black Fender Stratocaster and a $1,900 Gibson Les Paul gold top since the beginning of the year.

While cops claim that Gaydos admitted to the thefts, blaming them on a drug problem, the former actor reportedly pleaded not guilty to the charges in court."

On Tuesday, January 22, 2019, Defendant Smollett received a written letter at the Cinespace Chicago Film Studios, which is a facility on the Southwest Side of Chicago where the Empire Television Show is filmed. This letter contained written threats directed toward Defendant Smollett, and contained a then unknown white powdery substance. The letter also contained cut out letters pieced together which stated ""Smollett Jussie you will die black f--"", and the word ""MAGA"" was hand written on the envelope where the return address is typically located. This powdery substance has since been determined to be crushed ibuprofen tablets. The letter also contained a drawing of a stick figure, which appears to have a rope around the neck and a gun pointed at it. Law enforcement authorities were contacted, and the letter was turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is currently conducting forensic analysis of the letter.

In January of 2019, and at all times relevant hereto, Defendant Smollett was close friends with an individual by the name of Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo, who is 25 years old. Smollett and Abel initiated their friendship in the fall of 2017. During the course of this friendship, Defendant Smollett and Abel socialized together, exercised together, as well as worked together on the Fox television series Empire. Within that working relationship, Abel was a stand-in for a character named “Kai”, who is a love interest of Defendant Smollet’s character on the Empire TV Show. Additionally, text messages between Defendant Smollett and Abel revealed that Abel was a source of designer drugs for Defendant Smollett. Specifically, since the spring of 2018, on several occasions, Defendant Smollett requested Abel to provide him with “Molly”, which is a street name for the narcotic Ecstasy.

Text messages generated by Defendant Smollett to Abel, specifically starting on the morning of January 25, 2019, reveal Defendant Smollett asking Abel when he would be leaving on his upcoming trip to Nigeria. This trip was scheduled to take place on the evening of January 29, 2019, and it had been planned by Abel and his brother Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo (27 years old) two months prior.

After Abel confirmed the date and time of his tri trip, Defendant Smollett texted Abel stating “Might need your help on the low. You around to meet up and talk face to face?” The two then made arrangements to meet at the Cinespace Studios that afternoon, where Defendant Smollett subsequently drove Abel home to Abel’s apartment in the Lakeview neighborhood. During the ride, Defendant Smollett indicated to Abel his displeasure with the Empire Studio’s handling of the racist and homophobic letter he received three days prior. Defendant Smollett then stated that he wanted to stage an attack where Abel would appear to batter him. Defendant Smollett also suggested that Abel’s older brother Ola assist him with the attack. Defendant Smollett had met Ola on several previous occasions through Abel. Additionally, Ola had also appeared as an extra of the Empire TV show. Abel and Ola are both dark skinned, black males, born in the United States, with Nigerian decent.

When Defendant Smollett and Abel reached Abel’s apartment at approximately 5:00 PM on January 25, 2019, Ola, who was then living with Abel, was summoned into Defendant Smollett’s vehicle. Once inside, Smollett asked Ola if he could trust him. When Ola said he could, Smollett detailed his plans of the attack to the brothers. Defendant Smollett stated that he wanted them to appear to attack him on the evening of January 28, 2019 near his apartment building in Streeterville. Defendant Smollett also stated that he wanted the brothers to catch his attention by calling him an “Empire F****t, Empire N****r.

Defendant Smollett further detailed that he wanted Abel to attack him, but not hurt him too badly and give him a chance to appear to fight back. Defendant Smollett also included that he wanted Ola to place a rope around his neck, pour gasoline on him and yell “This is MAGA country.”

Prior to the brothers getting out of Smollett’s car, Smollett provided Abel with a $100 bill to purchase the rope, gasoline, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps which resemble the ones that say “Make America Great Again.” The ride from Cinescape Studios to the Osundairo brothers' home and the meeting between Smollett and the brothers is corroborated by CPD POD videos and cellular phone tower data of Smollett’s phone number.

On the late morning of Sunday January 27, 2019, Smollett drove his vehicle back to the Lakeview neighborhood to pick up the brothers and show them the scene where he wanted the staged attack to take place. Smollett then drove the brothers to the corner of New Street and North Water Street in Chicago where the staged attack was to take place. This was just outside Smollett’s apartment building. Further details were provided by Smollett which included that the staged attack was to take place near the stairs on the southwest corner of New and NorthWater Streets at 10:00PM the following night. Smollett also instructed the brothers not to bring their cell phones with them.

Smollett directed the brothers’ attention toward a surveillance camera on the corner, which he believed would capture the incident. There was a change in the plan that bleach was going to be used rather than gasoline during the simulated attack. Smollett then drove the brothers home and provided them with a $3500 personal check made payable to Abel, which was backdated to January 23, 2019.

On the morning of January 28, 2019, the date of the planned incident, the brothers purchased the clothing items at a local beauty supply store and the rope at a nearby hardware store, using the $100 bill that Smollett had given them. These purchases were corroborated by surveillance video and a receipt. Abel also deposited Smollett’s check that same day in his own bank account. Later that evening, the plan had changed and the time of the attack had to be pushed back because Smollett’s flight into O’Hare Airport from New York had been delayed by four hours. Smollett’s plane eventually landed at O’Hare at 12:30 AM on January 29, 2019. At 12:49 AM, there was a phone call between Smollett and Abel which lasted three minutes. During this call, Smollett told Abel the attack would take place at exactly 2:00 AM at the preset location. Minutes later Ola ordered an Uber ride share to his home to leave for the crime scene. Cell phone records and Uber records confirm this call and the Uber ride.

The brothers then took the Uber to the 1400 block of North Wells where they exited the Uber and flagged down a taxi which took them to within three blocks of the arranged scene at approximately 1:22 AM. The taxi’s in-car video captures the brothers flagging the cab and riding in the back seat.

From approximately 1:22A.M. until approximately 2:03A.M., video evidence showed the brothers on foot in an area bordered by Lake Shore Drive on the east, Columbus Drive on the west, Illinois Street to the north, and the Chicago River to the south. Video evidence also showed that Smollett returned back to his apartment from the airport at approximately 1:30 AM. At 1:45 AM, Smollett left his building to walk to a nearby Subway restaurant at Illinois Street and McClurg Court At 2:00 AM, the brothers were at the intersection of New St. and North Water Street; however, Defendant Smollett did not arrive exactly at the preset time. The brothers then proceeded a quarter block north and waited near a bench until Smollett arrived, which was four minutes later. Surveillance cameras captured the brothers waiting at this location just prior to the staged attack.

During Smollett’s interview on ABC’s Good Morning America which aired on February 14, 2019, he identified the people shown in a still of this surveillance video as his attackers. Also, during this interview, Smollett indicated that he was positive that these were his attackers. The two men in this video are in fact that Osundairo brothers.

It was at this time, that the brothers staged the attack of Defendant Smollett just how Smollett had instructed them. While the staged attack was occurring, a witness, who is an employee of NBC News Chicago, had just parked and exited her vehicle just around the corner from the location of the staged attack. This witness indicated that she heard nothing at the time the staged attack was occurring, despite the fact that Defendant Smollett told CPD detectives that his attackers were “yelling” racial and homophobic slurs at him, and he in turn was “yelling” back at them. The staged attack lasted 45 seconds, and it was just outside the view of the desired nearby camera that Smollett had pointed out to the brothers approximately 15 hours earlier.

Approximately one minute later, video evidence showed the brothers run from the location, southbound toward the Chicago River and westbound toward Columbus Drive. Video evidence also captured the brothers entering a taxi at the Hyatt Regency Hotel across the river at 02:10 A.M.

Video evidence then showed that at 2:25 AM, the brothers exit the taxi on the 3600 block of North Marshfield Ave. and walk northbound. This was only a few blocks from the brothers’Lakeview apartment, which was also the original Uber pick up location to the staged crime scene. Video shows the brothers walking from where they were dropped off toward their home. Two minutes after the brothers exited the taxi, at 2:27 A.M., Defendant Smollett’s manager called the police to report the incident. At approximately 2:42 A.M., Chicago Policearrived at Smollett’s apartment.

Chicago Police Officers observed that Smollett had a rope draped around his neck. This was captured on police body worn camera. Seconds later,Smollett asked the Police to shut off the cameras. Smollett then made a police report where he claimed he was the victim of an attack in which the offenders struck him while yelling racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett also reported that the offenders placed a rope around his neck, poured a liquid chemical on him, and told him this is “MAGA Country.”

Defendant Smollett also reported for the first time, that three days prior, on January 26, 2019, he received a phone call from an unidentified phone number in which an unidentified male caller stated, ""Hey you little F----"" before ending the call. Smollett also told police that the incident happened near a camera, which he stated should have captured the attack. This is the same camera that Defendant Smollett pointed out to the Osundairo brothers in preparation of this staged attack. Smollett also told police that the initial and primary attacker (now known to be Abel Osundairo) was wearing a ski mask which covered his entire face, with the exception of his eyes and the area all around his eyes. Smollett stated to the police that he could see that the area around this person’s eyes was white-skinned. As stated earlier in this proffer, the Osundairo brothers are dark skinned male blacks. During the Good Morning America interview referenced earlier, Smollett stated “And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more…” These statements by Smollett further misled the police and the public to believe that his attackers were white.

On January 29, 2019 at 7:45 PM, just less than 18 hours following reported attack, Defendant Smollett placed a phone call to Abel and the duration of the call was five seconds. Two minutes later, Abel called back Smollett and the call lasted 1 minute and 34 seconds. The brothers then boarded their flight to Nigeria and left the country. On January 30, 2019 at 10:46 AM, Defendant Smollett called Abel, who was in Istanbul Turkey, and the duration of the call lasted 8 minutes and 48 seconds.

For the next two weeks, the Chicago Police Department investigated this matter as a Hate Crime. Chicago police were able to identify the Osundairo brothers as the alleged attackers through an extensive investigation using Surveillance Videos, Police Pod Videos, in-car taxi camera videos, rideshare records, credit card records, bank records, and a store receipt. On February 13, 2019, the brothers returned from Nigeria, landing at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, and they were detained by US Customs. Members of the Chicago Police Department then placed them into custody. That same evening, the Chicago Police executed a Search Warrant upon the Osundairo brothers’ residence where they recovered evidence which linked Abel to the Empire TV show. Chicago Police already had determined that Ola was affiliated with the show as well.

Following their arrest and through consultation with their attorneys, the brothers agreed to cooperate in the investigation. As more evidence, such as text messages, phone records, social media records, bank records, surveillance video and the receipt from the purchase of the rope was obtained by investigators, the investigation shifted from a Hate Crime to a Disorderly Conduct investigation.

The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office approved charges of Disorderly Conduct against Defendant Smollett at 6:10 PM on February 20, 2019. At 5:00 AM this morning (January 21, 2019), Defendant Smollett was placed into custody at Area Central Chicago Police Headquarters."

“I sit down with him, and I don’t know what he’s going to say,” Roberts said. “Following up [about how] he couldn’t believe people didn’t believe him, well I go, ‘You’re out 2 o’clock in the morning, you’re getting a sandwich, [and] you won’t give up your phone.’”

“I pride myself in being fair, I know how much work went into being balanced about what had happened and to challenge him on certain things,” she said.

Since Smollett was considered a victim at the time of their interview, she noted how she carefully selected her questions.

“There’s so many people who do not come forward because others are not believed. I don’t know how this is all going to end,” she said. “We still talk to the [Chicago] police superintendent [Eddie T. Johnson].”

Despite numerous questions surrounding the alleged incident and the way Smollett’s own account of things changed several times, Roberts interviewed the actor. She gave him an unchallenging platform on which to ramble on and on about how racist people were for not believing him.

There’s a lot of people who have already canceled out “Empire” star Jussie Smollett after Chicago police stated that he did stage his own brutal attack. However, with new reports saying that he may be telling the truth, there are many other people who would rather wait until all the details have been shared before making a final judgment, like Queen Latifah!

Although Jussie has been painted in a bad light by the media, the actress is not giving up on him just yet. Queen Latifah inspired:

“The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet.” She goes to say, “And that’s just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof — which I haven’t seen yet — then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise,” Page Six quotes.

While speaking to Zainab Salbi, host of the Yahoo News show “Through Her Eyes,” Latifah admitted:

“I don’t even know what to make of it. All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.”

Chicago police claim Jussie paid two Nigerian men $3,500 to stage his attack. Now, although they were seen on camera purchasing masks and ropes, they admitted that Smollett paid them to help him workout.

Smollett is due back in court on March 14. Until then, let us know your thoughts in the comment box below!

In a dogpile of a mayoral race, 14 candidates fought it out to connect to voters who had long ago given into a nasty case of learned helplessness. The two top winners -- both black women -- beat out a rich scion of a Chicago political dynasty, a Latina state official, the city's former top cop and a bevy of other local luminaries.

The two finalists are former assistant U.S. attorney Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. And no matter which one of them wins the April 2 runoff Chicago's inauguration of a female African-American mayor will make a kind of history that none of the other top cities in America can claim.

It's a stunning turn of events in a town known for never wanting ""nobody nobody sent.""

And it's a relief, indicating that there are still strides people of color can hope for after a long, miserable Black History Month, which featured allegations that top government officials in Virginia wore blackface in college.

Closer to home, there was collective fear and then outrage (of many different kinds) when it appeared that ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett had staged a hate crime in which he claimed he was attacked by assailants who yelled racist and homophobic slurs.

Oh, and then there's the cop-on-minority-resident issue. This inspired a federal consent decree requiring the Chicago Police Department to undergo reforms to ensure people of color are treated humanely by the law enforcement officers who are sworn to protect them.

And I'm also sick of the perceptions that Chicago's murder rate is the highest in the nation -- it's not, and by some measures doesn't even crack the top 20.

So, yeah, the city could use good news in the form of a historic change of leadership from Rahm Emanuel, a big-interests-focused political operator. Either one of these two women could, in theory, address the neglect of the African-American community, which has caused what some experts consider to be a mass migration of black people out of the city and into the suburbs, neighboring Indiana or the Southern states where the original Great Migration began.

Though we've earned a high-five, at this specific moment in politics, it may be a toss-up whether the Preckwinkle-Lightfoot battle is more interesting because of the race angle or the gender one.

For decades Chicago's South Side communities had been a major economic engine for black communities and the city, but the city starved the neighborhoods of resources so much that its residents have, no doubt, come to believe that their votes don't count.

That perception wasn't helped by initial precinct returns showing the two front-runners were elected not by the grassroots of the city's African-American base, but by predominantly white wards on the North Side of the heavily segregated city.

So what's left to watch?

How these two women -- both very strong candidates who are in a struggle to differentiate themselves as more progressive than the other -- will demonstrate executive competence and leadership without falling off the tightrope of being ""likable"" vs. ""shrill"" or ""bossy.""

These are exemplars that the female Democrats who have declared their candidacy for president would do well to keep an eye on.

At least it won't be a boring race. As evidenced by her campaign thus far, Lightfoot -- a self-proclaimed out and proud black lesbian -- has seemingly never even heard of the ""be nice"" political playbook that's expected of women politicians -- perhaps a winning formula for other, future female high-office candidates?

Lightfoot came out a-brawlin' the day after the election, accusing Preckwinkle of squandering the opportunity to take a leadership role in preventing the violence in the city. Lightfoot also accused Preckwinkle of refusing to address poverty, spreading false rumors, and threatening to ""take her out"" of the mayor's race.

Preckwinkle, a consummate Chicago machine-politics player, will certainly land her own well-funded punches in the next five weeks leading up to the run-off.

Whoever emerges as the winner however, will require time to set up shop and expand her powers.

Her story will, for at least a while, inevitably be more about how she convinced voters of all stripes to trust in her, rather than about what she does once in office.

That glass ceiling that Hillary Clinton said was left with a million cracks in it after her loss in 2016? The 2020 presidential candidates who want to finally break through it will do well to follow this race closely.

Smollett currently faces accusations of falsifying an alleged hate crime in which he told Chicago police he was attacked by two white men who yelled, “This is MAGA country, made homophobic comments, tied a rope around his neck, and threw bleach over him.

Roberts interviewed Smollett on February 14, one week before the actor was formally charged with disorderly conduct and accused of staging the attack.

During the interview, Smollett teared up when asked about the attack and chastised “doubters” who were questioning his story.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,” Smollett told Roberts. “And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

He added: “It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.”

Speaking at The Cut‘s “How I Get It Done” event in Brooklyn on Monday, Roberts was asked if she felt she should have been more aggressive in her questioning of Smollett.

“I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man,” she said, according to Page Six. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother.’ If I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.'”

Roberts said it was “a no-win situation for me.”

“I pride myself in being fair,” she continued. “I know how much work went into being balanced about what had happened and to challenge him on certain things.”

Elaborating further, Roberts revealed that she wasn’t sure whether to do the interview or not.

“I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up,’ and then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not,” she said, adding, “They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview.’”

Roberts’ interview with Smollett aired after Chicago police sources had started suggesting that Smollett may have fabricated the attack, but Roberts was quick to point out that she couldn’t have known that at the time in order to ask Smollett about it.

“People are looking at the interview through the eyes of ‘How did you not know?’” she said. “I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.”

Smollett continues to deny accusations that he staged the attack, issuing a statement through his lawyers blasting the Chicago Police Department’s handling of the investigation and calling the allegations against him “an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election,” his legal team said in a statement. “Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

In light of the situation, Smollett was suspended from Fox drama Empire, with producers confirming he wouldn’t appear in the final two episodes of season five and calling the allegations “very disturbing.”

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us” Empire executives Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said. “Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”"

For the first time in years, the drumbeat of civil war has become audible across the United States. The nation looks destined to repeat history thanks to a media that is no longer able to objectively perform its job.

The predominantly left-leaning US media has just entered its third consecutive year of open warfare against Donald Trump. This non-stop assault risks aggravating political passions to the point where ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ snowballs into something completely beyond our ability to control. Like full-blown Civil War.

Over the weekend, the Washington Post, one of most prominent serial producers of partisan agitation, published an article entitled, ‘In America, talk turns to something unspoken for 150 years: Civil War’. The piece, which deftly places Democrats above the fray, opens with the following whiff of grapeshot:

“With the report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III reportedly nearly complete, impeachment talk in the air and the 2020 presidential election ramping up … there’s talk of violence, mayhem and, increasingly, civil war,” the Bezos-owned paper forewarned.

CNN Asks What Would Happen If Trump Refuses to Accept Defeat in 2020 https://t.co/Rw1r0TqUrz — Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) February 24, 2019

With a level of audacity and self-righteousness that has become a trademark of the Left, not once did the article float the possibility that just maybe the mainstream media is complicit in the ongoing deterioration of political discourse, or that the Democrats are just as much to blame as the Republicans for the political fallout that now presents a grave risk to the Republic.

As many knowledgeable Americans will openly admit, battle lines have been drawn across the political and cultural frontier. This division is perhaps most conspicuous on social media, where friends and family who disagree with our political worldview get the ‘nuke option’ and are effortlessly vanquished (‘unfriended’) with the push of a button. This is a worrying development. The real danger will come when Americans from both sides of the political divide stop talking and start erecting electronic barriers around their political belief systems. Not even family members are spared from the tumult; just because people share the same bloodline does not automatically mean they share the same political views. America, though still green behind the ears, may understand that fact better than many other countries.

The United States has taken part in its fair share of military conflicts over the years, but its deadliest war to date has been the one that pitted Americans against each other. The so-called Civil War (1861-1865), waged between the North and South over the question of Southern secession from the Union, resulted in the death of some 620,000 soldiers from the Union and Confederate armies (and possibly as high as 850,000, according to other estimates).

Put another way, more Americans died in the Civil War than in all of the country’s other conflicts combined. For a country that has been at war for much of its existence that is a sobering fact.

With that historical footnote in mind, the mainstream media should better appreciate its responsibility for presenting an objective and balanced depiction of modern events. Yet nothing today would suggest that is the case. One need only look at the way it has blotched recent politically charged events – like the Covington High School and Jussie Smollett scandals, not to mention the ‘Russia collusion’ hoax – to say that something is seriously out of whack inside of the Fourth Estate. The muzzled mainstream media has simply lost its mind over Donald Trump and can no longer perform its duties with any discernible amount of objectivity.

Indeed, the US leader continues to serve as a piñata for the agenda-driven media, which takes daily swings at him and his administration – and despite the fact that his popularity remains very high among voters. Only on the fringes of the media world, in the far away land of Fox News and Breitbart, will the reader find level-headed reports on the American president. This is not to suggest, of course, that Trump is beyond criticism. Not at all. There is a lot not to like about the 45th president. At the same time, however, to assume that Trump and his administration is the root of all evil, as the media would lead us to believe, is not only ridiculous, it is outright dangerous.

With no loss of irony, a good example of the media bias against Trump can be found in the very Post article that frets over the outbreak of another Civil War. While everyone knows that it takes two to tango, you would never guess that by reading this piece. In the sheltered world of the Liberal-dominated media, ‘tango’ is a solo event where the political right is portrayed as engaged in a dance with itself, while the political left watches – innocuously, of course – from the sidelines.

Michael Cohen, for example, Trump’s turncoat personal lawyer who committed perjury by lying to Congress, was quoted high in the article as saying, “Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power.”

Now that is certainly rich. Ever since Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, Washington has been consumed by the Mueller investigation, and amid mindless chatter that Trump is an illegitimate president slated for impeachment. In other words, the last thing that can be said about the Democrats is that they facilitated a “peaceful transition of power.” In fact, they have hobbled Trump and his administration ever since he entered the Oval Office.

Another pro-Liberal voice dragged into the Civil War story was Robert Reich, who served on Barack Obama's economic transition advisory board. The Post linked to an article Reich wrote last year where he posited the fictional scenario where an impeachment resolution against the president is enacted, thus kicking off mass civil strife on the direct command of dear leader.

“Trump claims it's the work of the ‘deep state’”, according to Reich’s febrile imagination. “Sean Hannity of Fox News demands that every honest patriot take to the streets. Right-wing social media call for war. As insurrection spreads, Mr. Trump commands the armed forces to side with the ‘patriots.’”

“The way Mr. Trump and his defenders are behaving, it’s not absurd to imagine serious social unrest,” Reich continued. “That’s how low he’s taken us.”

Now that is some world-class chutzpah. In fact, it is the same self-righteous, ingratiating tone that weaves itself throughout the Post article. In keeping with the mainstream media’s non-stop narrative, Trump and the Republicans are blamed for everything that has gone wrong in the country, while the Democrats come off as little angels trying to piece the fractured country back together.

As already mentioned, Donald Trump is certainly not above criticism. Far from it. But for the mainstream media to place all of the blame for the current political malaise at the Republican’s door is about as responsible as lighting up a cigarette inside of a Chinese fireworks factory. The US media has an unmistakable agenda, and that is to make damn sure Trump is not reelected to another term in 2020. To that end, it has shown a devious willingness to betray all journalistic ethics and standards, which has the effect of increasing the political temperature to boiling point. It then points the finger of blame at the political right for the accumulated pile of pent-up tensions, which are ready to ignite at the first spark.

If the mainstream media continues to slavishly serve just one political master over another, it will only have itself to blame for what comes next. Its prejudiced and agenda-based reporting is a disgrace and really nothing short of a bona fide national security threat.

The Good Morning America co-host sat down with the Empire actor on Feb. 12 to discuss the alleged hate crime against him. Just over a week later, he was arrested for making a false police report. (He maintains his innocence.) Roberts talked about how her interview came to be, including doubts she had about doing it in the first place, as well as the criticism she’s faced since it aired, describing it as a “no-win situation.”

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like, ‘I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,’” the morning TV personality said during The Cut’s “How I Get It Done” event on Monday. “I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up.’ And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

His handlers made it enticing, saying that the star would reveal new details about the so-called hate crime and Roberts was told she could challenge him about the “red flags” she saw in his story. “I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy,'” she recalled. “He’s going to go on record for the first time. Yes, I’ll do the interview.”

On the day of the interview, it started two-and-a-half hours late. She tried to be as “neutral” as possible, saying, “I pride myself in being fair.” And Smollett was considered a victim at the time. However, she talked about challenging him, including when, after he said he “couldn’t believe people didn’t believe him,” pointing out, “Well, I go, ‘You’re out at 2 o’clock in the morning, you’re getting a sandwich, [and] you won’t give up your phone.’”

Roberts also said she felt pressure to represent the LGBT community during the sit-down. “I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man,” she said. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.’”

She concluded, “It was a no-win situation for me.”

The interview aired two days later on Feb. 14 and by then the two Nigerian brothers — Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo — were in police custody and claimed that they were paid by the actor to stage the attack.

“People are looking at the interview through the eyes of ‘How did you not know?’” Roberts recalled. “I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.”

She admitted, “It was one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do” because “all I wanted was to get to the truth. All I wanted was to give the truth.” And the criticism over it “was hurtful, some of the things that were said. I’ll be honest.”

Smollett turned himself into police on Feb. 21. At the time, Roberts called it “a setback for race relations, homophobia, MAGA supporters. I cannot think of another case where there is this anger on so many sides, and you can understand why there would be.” The actor, who is out on bond, is set to appear in court on March 14.

Yahoo News released a Tuesday preview of “Through Her Eyes,” a show hosted by activist Zainab Salbi that explores issues through the experiences of women, in which Latifah was asked about being compassionate toward Smollett in light of the news that he may have staged his own attack.

“The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet,” Latifah told Salbi. “So until I see some definitive proof, which I haven’t seen yet, then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.” (RELATED: Robin Roberts Opens Up About Jussie Smollett Interview)

Smollett was charged with a felony after allegedly filing a false police report back in January. According to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, the two men who attacked Smollett confessed claiming the entire attack was set up by Smollett.

When asked if this case should be viewed through a “racial justice lens”, Latifah responded, “I don’t even know what to make of it. All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.”

Queen Latifah expressed her support of the 36-year-old in the aftermath of statements and news reports that have been made on Smollett's charges.

in January 2019, Jussie Smollett reported to police that he was the victim of a racist and hate crime. As the findings of the investigation poured out to the public, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson and other law enforcement officials deemed Smollett staged the attack after evidence countered the actor's testimony.

Since then, Smollett's supporters have stood by his side as the legal proceedings continue. One backer is Queen Latifah, who expressed her support of the 36-year-old despite the statements and news reports that have been made in the aftermath of Smollett's charges.

""The guy I've seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who's very kind and who's always been cool and sweet,"" Latifah said on Yahoo News' ""Through Her Eyes"" show. The future real estate mogul added that until ""definitive proof"" appears, then ""I gotta go with him until I see otherwise."" Both Latifah and Smollett are part of director Lee Daniels' hit series creations, Star and Empire, respectively.

In a statement issued to Deadline, Smollett's attorneys said they plan to enact their own investigation to prove their client's guiltlessness. ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" the statement reads. ""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

Snollett currently faces charges of disorderly conduct and filing a false police report. The New York Post states his court date is set for March 14."

Having learned from breathless, sensational local reporting that a creepy character named Momo was convincing kids to harm or even kill themselves, the Florida school district had thought it prudent to restrict its 193,000 students' access to the internet.

Perhaps it would have been wiser to restrict the adults' access to local television. The Momo challenge is a full-on hoax: There are no videos of Momo—in reality, a statue called ""Mother Bird"" made by a Japanese artist named Keisuke Aiso—telling kids to hurt themselves. There has been no rash of Momo-inspired murders or suicides. There are no victims of Momo. Put another way, Momo is pure fake news—and a shocking number of journalists are guilty of spreading it.

But this should surprise no one. Though President Trump mainstreamed the term ""fake news"" after the 2016 election in order to delegitimize perfectly deserved press criticism, people of all ideological persuasions should beware the frequent spread of nonsensical, sensational, conspiratorial, and utterly false news stories—everything from obvious fakes like Momo to the slightly more robust yet equally absurd contentions that sex trafficking and hate crimes are ever-worsening epidemics.

A terrific piece for Nieman Lab names and shames many of the gullible fools in local media who were guilty of spreading the Momo hoax. KBJR 6 in Wisconsin noted that ""there's no proof the Momo challenge is real,"" but uncritically interviewed a bunch of people who were scared about it, anyway. An ABC station in Tampa explained that ""the challenge is to meet Momo and to do that one must follow a series of instructions, which can include harming others or yourself,"" even though no part of this statement is accurate. KUTV News in Utah claimed a terrifying video was encouraging kids to kill each other, and had infiltrated ""popular children sites like Youtube Kids."" It hadn't. It's made up.

Unfortunately, the media, particularly local media, falls for these kinds of hoaxes all the time. Every year around Halloween, news outlets prey on parents' unreasonable fears of sex offenders abducting their kids, or malicious strangers feeding them poisoned candy, even though neither of these things ever happen. (Spoiler: The parents did it.) Sometimes a concerned citizen drives the news cycle, like when a woman claimed she got into the wrong Uber and very narrowly avoided being sold into sex slavery. (Fact check: Nope.) Sometimes the hoax gets an assist from the police or schools, as was the case with Momo.

Trump has called fake news ""the enemy of the people."" Unfortunately, the president is a serial purveyor of falsehoods, especially relating to immigration. To take just one example: in January, Trump promoted a Washington Examiner article about ranchers finding prayer rugs at the souther border, an indication that not just Mexicans but Muslims—or terrorists, who really knows?—were entering the country illegally. The story is far-fetched, and relies on a single anonymous source. Trump and his conservative supporters often criticize negative White House reporting that cites anonymous sourcing, but when the anonymous sources are pushing an agenda they approve of, then it's okay.

Conservatives spread fake news as eagerly as anyone else, of course. At the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, Sara Carter, a visiting fellow with the Independent Women's Forum, told the audience, ""Our kids are having parties, they call them Skittles parties, where they bring pills and put them into bowls, and everybody just kind of picks whatever pill they want and they take them. It's kind of a shocking thing when I heard about this, just randomly taking pills. Some of these children, unbeknownst to them, are taking a Xanax that's actually a contraband Xanax, and they are dying immediately.""

Woah, if true. But it's not. The Skittles party rumor appears to be a reboot of something called a pharming party; Politico's Jack Shafer has debunked its existence over and over again. Yes, teenagers experiment with alcohol and drugs, but they are actually drinking less heavily they used to, and their drug of choice is the comparatively harmless marijuana. In any case, there is little direct, firsthand evidence of teens ritualistically contributing pills to a general supply and then consuming them at random.

Fake news can be used to scare people into supporting terrible public policies. Such is the case with the so-called sex-trafficking epidemic, the existence of which has been carefully refuted by Reason's Elizabeth Nolan Brown over and over again. Now the narrative—which holds that hundreds of thousands of kids are at risk of being sex trafficked every year, even though those numbers are based on nothing, and almost certainly false—has ensnared Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who was arrested in February as part a human-trafficking sting. Kraft is accused of frequenting the Orchids of Asia Day Spa, where women were forced into ""modern day slavery,"" according to Sports Illustrated. Salacious? Yep. Fake? Of course.

""There's no allegation that anyone engaged in human trafficking,"" Palm Beach District Attorney Dave Aronberg admitted. By all accounts, this was garden variety prostitution, not sex slavery.

Then there's the hate crime spike. Organizations like the Southern Povery Law Center and Anti-Defamation League have claimed that the U.S. hate crime rate is surging under Trump—the implication being that racists, anti-Muslim bigots, anti-Semites, and homophobes are emboldened by the president's spiteful rhetoric toward minorities and immigrants. Many celebrities, activists, and politicians opined that they were not surprised when two Trump supporters allegedly attacked Jussie Smollett—the gay, black star of the TV show Empire—in the streets of Chicago and shouted ""this is MAGA country."" It now seems overwhelmingly likely that the attack was a hoax perpetrated by Smollett himself.

In fact, it's not even clear that the prevalence of hate crimes is actually increasing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has tracked hate crimes for more than 20 years, and the 2017 total is actually lower than the 1996 total. The number has gone up some years and down others, but it's hard to know what's really happening since the number of agencies submitting data to the federal database had increased over time—nearly 1,000 additional municipalities submitted information in 2017 versus 2016.

Data is often deployed for misleading ends. As I explained during a recent Fox News appearance, the ADL's claim that anti-Semitic hate, for instance, has spiked 57 percent in the last year is not nearly as compelling as it seems: A rash of bomb threats made by a single Israeli teenager was largely responsible for the jump, and anti-Semitic assaults had actually fallen.

We don't have to call all these things ""fake news"" if the term has simply become too politically loaded. But we do need some way of describing this phenomenon, since the basic idea that the American people should not automatically believe everything they hear on TV or read on social media—even if it's being pushed by a seemingly reputable news outlet—is sound. Be wary of politicians trying to escape scrutiny by claiming their naysayers are peddling fake news, but also be wary of people in the media trying to sell you on the idea that sex traffickers, hate criminals, migrant caravans, and Momo are coming to get you."

Robert Roberts has broken her silence on her infamous sit-down with Jussie Smollett where he discussed the alleged hate crime in which he suffered injuries.

The Good Morning America anchor was frank about her apprehension prior to the interview during The Cut’s “How I Get It Done” event on Monday evening, according to Page Six, saying: “I’ll be completely honest, I was like I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not.” .

“I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up,’” Roberts continued. “And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

The morning show host revealed that she was assured she would be permitted to challenge Smollett on what she referred to as the “red flags” in his reporting of the alleged racist and homophobic attack. Roberts said she was told that Smollett would be offering new information during their discussion.

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy. He’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview,’” she clarified.

Roberts revealed that the interview began two-and-a-half hours later than it was scheduled.

“I sit down with him, and I don’t know what he’s going to say,” she said. “Following up [about how] he couldn’t believe people didn’t believe him, well I go, ‘You’re out 2 o’clock in the morning, you’re getting a sandwich, [and] you won’t give up your phone.’”

Roberts shared that she tried to stay “neutral” as a journalist and not allow her personal opinions or emotions affect her decision. She also admitted that she felt pressure to acknowledge the needs of the Black and LGBT community in her interview style.

“I’m a Black gay woman, he’s a Black gay man,” she said. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass,’” she explained. “It was a no-win situation for me.”

The Empire star was arrested last month after police charged him with disorderly conduct and filing a false report, a felony, in connection with his alleged attack, Chicago police said.

Smollett’s legal team Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson responded to the latest development in a statement Wednesday when charges were announced, saying that they will investigate as well."

She will be staying at the Queensbridge Housing Projects for a few days. According to the New York Daily News, which calls it a ‘live-in tour,’ she babbled on Facebook, “It is also the same community where the new Amazon headquarters was supposed to base. While my primary goal remains effectuating immediate on-site repairs & relaying failures to the monitor, I also plan to give the residents ‘A NATIONAL VOICE’ on what most of them deem to be a stolen opportunity with Amazon! Politics should NEVER play part in either fixing or securing jobs for #NYCHA!”

It doesn’t seem like they want her voice.

“Who the hell is Lynne Patton? Anything from Trump I don’t trust. I don’t think she wants to help,” said Carline Campbell, a 20-year resident of the Patterson Houses in the Bronx, where Patton was expected to stay first, according to the New York Daily News.

Earlier this month, Lynne Patton, who works at HUD even though she has no experience in public housing just like Ben Carson, announced that she will live in four different public housing properties for one week each as a guest of four families, the New York Daily News reported.

Last week, Patton went viral for being a national embarrassment as she stood behind Republican Rep. Mark Meadows who defended Donald Trump‘s racism. Meadows ranted,“Lynne Patton says she would not work for a man who is racist… She disagrees with you. She says as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, that there is no way that she would work for an individual who was a racist.” Meadows, who somehow believes Patton represents all African Americans, asked, “How do you reconcile the two of those?”

As Patton silently stood behind Meadows, willingly debasing herself even more than she already has being part of the Trump administration, Cohen said, “Ask Ms. Patton how many Black people are executives at the Trump Organization? The answer is zero.”

According to Politico, Carson babbled, “I think Cohen is trying to ingratiate himself to the people who hate Trump. I’ve never seen anything that even remotely would remind me of racists, and believe me, I recognize a racist when I see them.”

In case you missed it, during Cohen’s opening remarks he said about Trump, “He is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries ‘shitholes.’ In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a Black person that wasn’t a ‘shithole.’ This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States.”

He continued, “While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only Black people could live that way. And, he told me that Black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.”

In a bizarre move, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows pulled out Lynne Patton, who is reportedly Eric Trump‘s former party planner and now works at HUD with Carson, to prove 45 could not be racist.

Meadows babbled,“Lynne Patton says she would not work for a man who is racist… She disagrees with you.

As for Trump’s clear racism, housing discrimination lawsuits from the 1970s, the racist birther movement against Obama, the Muslim travel ban (a federal judge said it was racist), the Central Park Five (Trump called for the execution of five Black teenagers with a full page ad in the New York Times in 1989), saying a judge of Mexican heritage could not do his job because he is Mexican and constantly attacking Black public figures (Jay Z, Maxine Waters, Jemele Hill, Colin Kaepernick, etc.), but ignoring people like Eminem… just to name a few.

In other news, Carson said he will leave the administration after Trump’s second term “because I think you have just as much influence — maybe more — there.”

Let’s just hope there is no second term for Trump.

""I was like, 'I don’t know if I want to do the interview...'""

Robin Roberts is speaking out about how her Good Morning America interview with Jussie Smollett came about nearly a month ago.

According to Page Six, Roberts was hesitant to speak with the actor, who claimed in late-January that he was attacked by Trump supporters in Chicago after getting Subway. However, he was charged with felony disorderly conduct and for allegedly filing a false police report.

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like I don’t know if I want to do the interview [with Smollett] or not,” Roberts explained during an event for The Cut on Monday (Mar. 4). ""I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up.' And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not... 'As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview.'""

Roberts continued to discuss how she tried to approach the interview as ""neutral"" as possible, however, she discussed that it was a ""no-win situation"" for her as a journalist and a member of the LGTBQ community.

“I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man,” she said. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.'”

A few days after the interview aired, two brothers came forward with allegations that they were paid by the Empire star to help carry out the attack.

“I pride myself in being fair, I know how much work went into being balanced about what had happened and to challenge him on certain things,” Roberts explained. “There’s so many people who do not come forward because others are not believed. I don’t know how this is all going to end... It was one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do."""

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like ‘I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,’” Roberts shared on Monday during The Cut’s “How I Get It Done” event at 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge. “I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up,’ and then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

She went on to explain how, as a journalist, she felt that the interview was newsworthy, which ultimately played a part in her agreeing to do the interview. She also felt a responsibility as a Black gay woman to represent the LGBTQ community, despite some of the points throughout Smollett’s story that caused many to feel skeptical.

“I sit down with him, and I don’t know what he’s going to say,” she said. “Following up [about how] he couldn’t believe people didn’t believe him, well I go, ‘You’re out 2 o’clock in the morning, you’re getting a sandwich, [and] you won’t give up your phone.’”

The Reactions to the Alleged Sonic Movie Have Been Hilarious.

First Will Smith as the genie, and now this—social media really isn’t into the recently leaked live-action design of Sonic the Hedgehog. Like, since when does Sonic have two separate eyes? According to EuroGame.net, Sonic’s OG creator doesn’t even seem to be feeling it.

“Is this a Sonic movie?” Yuji Naka asked in a tweet, as translated by Microsoft translate. “I feel that it is important to look at the whole body visual of Sonic and head body and stomach. Did you not get a little more balance?”

The rest of Twitter had its two cents to put in, too. See some of the best reactions below:

This is probably the movie version of Sonic the Hedgehog. https://t.co/FqdCGHp9Ki pic.twitter.com/4lFQVdjMH5 — Kotaku (@Kotaku) March 4, 2019

What pissed me off most about this ""realistic"" design of Sonic, is that they TOOK an iconic part of his character. Which it's his shoes. It's Sonic's version of Mario's cap. And instead of updating them, they just being lazy and slap a Nike logo on them.

Kodak Black Fired Back at Reginae Carter re: Lil Wayne.

Reginae Carter, daughter of Lil Wayne, was rightfully not feeling Kodak Black’s recent unpleasant suggestion that Lil Wayne “should’ve died when you was a baby.” The daughter of the Cash Money rapper fired back on Monday stating that “this n***a whole album sound like my daddy old sh*t.”

“You new lil rappers need to start giving props and respect to the Goat,” she said on Instagram. “My father don’t bother nobody. … You pick the night he didn’t go to LIV to say that. You bold.”

Kodak Black—who denied dissing Weezy—hopped on Instagram live with this response:

Roberts admitted on March 4 that she initially resisted doing the interview because Smollett’s story—that he was assaulted by two white men in downtown Chicago at 2 a.m. in freezing temperatures and that he held onto his Subway sandwich—didn’t seem to be real.

Smollett also claimed that one of the alleged attackers shouted “This is MAGA country,” in an apparent reference to “Make America Great Again,” a slogan of President Donald Trump and his supporters.

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,” Roberts told the crowd at an event in New York City on Monday, reported the New York Post.

“I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up.’ And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

Roberts, 58, said she was promised she could challenge Smollett, 36, on the “red flags” in his story. She finally relented.

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview,” she said.

The subsequent interview was slammed by many as soft, with Roberts seemingly attempting to cast Smollett in a favorable light. It didn’t help that two days after the interview, when it aired, Chicago police arrested two Nigerian-American brothers who detectives said later revealed that Smollett orchestrated the attack, making it a hate crime hoax.

Roberts said she was cognizant of identity politics—with both her and the actor being black and gay—and knew she would be criticized by people who thought she wasn’t hard enough on Smollett while also facing questions from those supporting the actor.

“It was a no-win situation for me,” she said. At the time, since Smollett was still considered a victim, she framed her questions to acknowledge that context.

“It was one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do,” she said.

After the brothers were arrested, ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams said during a “Good Morning America” segment that comments Smollett made during the interview with Roberts could be used against him if the story does indeed turn out to be false.

Among them was Smollett’s confidence that the two people seen in surveillance footage walking near the scene of the alleged attack about 30 minutes before it reportedly took place were the same people that attacked him.

“In that interview, [Smollett] specifically says, ‘Yeah, those two guys on the surveillance footage, those are the guys that attacked me,’ so now he’s sort of boxed in,” Abrams said.

Police identified the two people as the brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, supporting the case that they were the attackers. When they informed police that Smollett paid them $3,500 to carry out the alleged hoax, officials began looking at Smollett as a suspect.

The actor was eventually arrested on Feb. 21 for filing a false police report.

In a statement in March, the brothers said they regretted helping Smollett perpetrate the alleged attack.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” said Gloria Schmidt, the brothers’ attorney, in a statement obtained by CBS Chicago.

Previously, the Osundairos, who met Smollett while acting on “Empire” and one of whom became the actor’s personal trainer, said in a statement that they’re not racist."

The accounts of her cruelty are astonishing. She once allegedly forced an employee to say to another senator’s staffer, “I’m supposed to tell you Senator Klobuchar is late today because I am bad at my job.” For Klobuchar, the dark night of the soul arrives right on schedule: She is known to fire off scathing emails to her staff between the hours of 1 and 3 o’clock in the morning. (“In a real dark night of the soul,” wrote another unstable Minnesotan, F. Scott Fitzgerald, “it is always three o’clock in the morning.”)

Graeme Wood: The two Amy Klobuchars

What could cause this burning rage in a woman who became popular among so many of us because of what had seemed to be her exemplary calm and high-mindedness? She has never addressed the question directly, but her 2015 autobiography, The Senator Next Door , offers plenty of clues. Her paternal grandfather was a hard drinker: “Sometimes he drank way too much and came home in a rage, yelling at my grandma about all kinds of grievances.” In turn, he raised an alcoholic.

Her father, Jim Klobuchar, a beloved regional newspaperman, was a serious alcoholic who spoiled family events; was charged with at least three DUIs and had to write an apology to readers of the Star Tribune; and once stopped with Amy on the way home from a Vikings game and ended up drinking in the upstairs room of a bar, while the child sat alone at the bar, nursing a 7 Up and wondering when her father would come back for her. He left his young family when Amy’s mother had just cashed out her teacher’s pension to build a new deck and an addition to the back of the house. (The dream of every woman in a bad marriage: Change the house and somehow the home will change too.) At his final DUI court date—after which he finally got sober in late midlife—Amy, by then a lawyer, accompanied him to a meeting with the court’s chemical-dependency counselor, which her father later wrote about: “She told of the damage my divorce had inflicted on her, her sister, and her mother … She spoke with fury and sorrow and in tears.”

In the classic fashion of children raised in deeply alcoholic families, the two Klobuchar daughters carved out very different identities for themselves. Amy the overachiever made her mark at Wayzata High School and went on to Yale and then to the University of Chicago Law School; Beth (who has since changed her name to Meagan) dropped out of high school, was gone from home for days at a time, and became an alcoholic before eventually seeking treatment for her disease, getting a GED, and going to college. The behavior that Klobuchar’s staff describes—the rage at minor imperfections; the middle-of-the-night rants; the development of a secret, shameful self—would not be out of character for someone with such a specifically brutal kind of upbringing."

DEMOCRATS LAUNCH NEW, WIDE-REACHING PROBE INTO TRUMP: House Democrats on Monday opened a huge new avenue in their investigations into President Trump, with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee firing off document requests to dozens of figures from the president's administration, family and business ... Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Monday the committee served document requests to 81 agencies, entities and individuals, as part of a new probe into ""alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other abuses of power by President Trump."" Nadler said the investigations were necessary to make sure the Trump presidency isn't a dictatorship. In addition to the White House, Nadler is also seeking information from Trump family members, like Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Jared Kushner; from former administration figures like former chief of staff Reince Priebus, former national security adviser Mike Flynn, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former spokeswoman Hope Hicks; and from Trump campaign figures like Brad Parscale and Corey Lewandowski.

In addition, Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel, and Oversight Committee chairman Elijah Cummings on Monday formally demanded interviews with any translators who witnessed Trump's communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin since Inauguration Day -- a request that comes as part of a sweeping series of inquiries virtually certain to be met with legal pushback by the White House. The only good news Trump received on the investigation front was that Attorney General William Barr will not recuse himself from Russia probe.

AOC, CHIEF OF STAFF UNDER INVESTIGATION: New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Saikat Chakrabarti, the progressive firebrand's multimillionaire chief of staff, apparently violated campaign finance law by working to funnel nearly $1 million in contributions from political action committees Chakrabarti established to private companies that he also controlled, according to acomplaint filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and obtained by Fox News ... Amid the allegations, a former FEC commissioner late Monday suggested in an interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation that Ocasio-Cortez and her team could be facing major fines and potentially even jail time if they were knowingly and willfully violating the law by hiding their control of the Justice Democrats political action committee (PAC), even as the PAC may have effectively supported her 2018 congressional primary campaign in excess of normal contribution limits.

CLINTON MAKES HER DECISION: Apparently, there will not be a Trump-Clinton rematch in 2020 ... Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, said in an interview Monday that she has ruled out a bid for the 2020 presidential election. The former first lady and secretary of state told News 12 Westchester that she will not be running for president next year. ""I'm not running, but I'm going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe,"" Clinton told the station, in the first local television interview since the midterm elections. Clinton also said she is ""not going anywhere.""

BUZZKILL: Tucker Carlson took the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed to task Monday night for his controversial (and now debunked) report last January that claimed President Trump instructed his personal attorney Michael Cohen to lie about the Moscow Tower project, asking him why his organization hasn’t explained the initial story ... “Since you’re the one who published the dossier in the first place don’t you have an obligation to kind of tie a bow in the story and tell us what happened in the end?” Carlson asked BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “I guess we don’t see tying bows as an obligation. We did cover the hell out of that. In particular that aspect,” Smith told Carlson. Carlson asked Smith why BuzzFeed hasn’t followed up on the refuted information in the initial report and published dossier. Smith defended BuzzFeed’s initial report and it’s follow up coverage.

REMEMBERING LUKE PERRY: Hollywood luminaries and fans are remembering actor Luke Perry as a television icon, childhood staple and an overall kind-hearted person — personally and professionally ... Perry, who gained fame as a teen heartthrob on ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" and became a fan-favorite TV dad with his starring role on the hit series ""Riverdale,""died Monday at age 52, days after suffering a massive stroke. ""He was surrounded by his children Jack and Sophie, fiancé Wendy Madison Bauer, ex-wife Minnie Sharp, mother Ann Bennett, step-father Steve Bennett, brother Tom Perry, sister Amy Coder, and other close family and friends,"" a rep for Perry told Fox News. ""The family appreciates the outpouring of support and prayers that have been extended to Luke from around the world, and respectfully request privacy in this time of great mourning. No further details will be released at this time.""

These two men allegedly slipped a noose around his neck while yelling homophobic and racial slurs. Now, more than three weeks later, the CPD believes Smollett lied about this incident and has since charged him with disorderly conduct on the basis of filing a false police report.

The CPD spent countless hours reviewing street camera footage, and no evidence of the attack was found. Before Smollett’s charge, many celebrities came out with statements of outrage against attacks such as his.

Not only did many influential celebrities make statements in support of Smollett, but Smollett himself told the public that he is working with the authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.” He even performed his music at a concert following the reported attack and said to the audience, “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

After two persons of interest were released from questioning without being charged, Smollett issued a statement Feb. 16, which said how he is “victimized by claims” that accuse him of working with the perpetrators and continues to say “nothing is further from the truth.”

Smollett was arrested Feb. 21 for filing a false police report, which is a felony.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson discussed the motivations behind Smollett executing such an incident in a news conference on the same day of Smollett’s arrest. He stated it was because the actor was dissatisfied with his salary on “Empire,” but continued to explain how it is despicable that this incident has gotten more coverage than every gun violence case in Chicago.

Smollett recognized the pain and anger of the American public, especially in the climate fostered under Donald Trump, and he decided to take advantage of those who are victims of discrimination. The noose is such a deep-seated image to the African-American community due to the countless hangings of them in American history. Smollett used a potent description because he knew of the implications and publicity it would have. He understood the anger that would stem from African-Americans and others hearing about such a case, so he used that to further his celebrity profile.

This was all based on the sole idea of the actor wanting greater pay, but the impact became so much more than that. If a celebrity gains higher profile, they would attract more viewership to the show and receive higher compensation for it. It became a spit in the face to African-American victims of real assault and discrimination. Not only is it disrespectful to the African-American community, but to the LGBTQ community as well.

Smollett went on “Good Morning America” and told Robin Roberts that, “You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this,” and described those who have doubts of his narrative as “offensive.” Smollett wanted the public to believe they were crazy for finding holes in his story.

His choice of falsely reporting an attack disrespects real hate crimes that occur daily in this country. It takes a lot of courage for victims to come out to the public about the abuse and attacks they face. The fact that Smollett called himself a victim is pure disrespect.

Most victims do not have the same celebrity status as Smollett. There are no celebrities tweeting with their support for the everyday person, but Smollett was able to get more coverage for a fake report than normal people do.

When incidents like these do get publicized, Smollett’s lies put even more doubt into the public’s mind. This could have real effects to the point where Americans become more skeptical in believing the truth behind someone’s accusations. This resistance to believe victims makes it harder to hold perpetrators responsible for their actions. According to FBI data, there was a 17 percent increase in hate crimes from 2017 to 2018. Those that already place immediate doubt in victims’ accusations have just fortified their thought processes through the Smollett case.

There are real victims of hate crimes, and it is our job to take their words to heart and give them the respect they deserve. Their situations are not instances to be made light of or used for someone’s self-interest."

And yet, within that plea from “the grandson of sharecroppers,” there lurks the erroneous presumption that this nation at one time was, well, normal. If we have learned anything in the age of Trump, it is that America is not nor has it ever been remotely “normal.” It is precisely its lack of normalcy and failure to recognize it that today has led it to the edge of the abyss. A nation built by slaves on stolen land obtained though genocide is not normal. A nation that despises those whose sacrifices were instrumental to its rise to world domination is anything but.

The problem is that so much of what is presented as a departure from “normal” has been a perennial fixture of American life. Indeed, social movements such as Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, and Time’s Up – have arisen to challenge this normalcy. This is the ugly nature of “American exceptionalism” that the nation itself fails to acknowledge, one that has taken a daily barrage of reality-checking cell phone, Internet and social media imagery, and the election of a petulant, narcissistic charlatan to finally begin to dispel.

Nowadays we speak of the “new normalcy” under Trump and his ilk, when in fact it is a continuation of the old with only a few superficial tweaks. The old and new normal are substantially the same: both fail to recognize and reconcile fundamental contradictions between America’s lofty ideals and the sordid reality of their betrayal. The difference is the latter throws its transgressions in our faces, smugly confident in our inability to challenge them to realize fundamental change. The brief interval of subtle, “polite” racism of the old normal has given way to the rude, open disdain and hatred of the new.

・The new normal is rife with the contradictions of the old. Blackface was once part and parcel of that normalcy, its imprint stamped into virtually every artifact of Americana. Historical revisionists would have us believe that at one point it disappeared like the feeble memories of those who once performed and enjoyed it, replaced by a more mature appreciation of black people and their contributions to American culture. And yet today from college students to Marines, the practice thrives, as do the excuses, denials, and crocodile tears of “accidental” contritionists who claim they didn’t realize that it was and remains offensive.

・The new normal is Maryland lawmaker Mary Ann Lisanti warning a white colleague against campaigning in “nigger districts,” then claiming to be “sickened that a word that is not in my vocabulary came out of my mouth,” as if that word like an errant fly somehow stealthy flew in there and had to be spat out. This is the same Lisanti who when asked previously by Huffington Post if she had ever used the epithet before responded with a nonchalant “sure,” confidently adding, “I’m sure everyone has used it. I’ve used the f-word. I used the Lord’s name in vain.” Apparently Lisanti is a big fan of Whitman – and wayward flies.

・The new normal is North Carolina congressman Mark Meadows taking pouty, beet-faced, teary-eyed umbrage at Representative Rashida Tlaib’s accurate observation that his use of a Trump employee as a human prop (or is that “human shield”?) was a racist act during the same congressional hearing to counter Cohen’s depiction of Trump as a racist. It can be seen in Meadows self-defensive assertion that his relationship with his “good friend” Cummings “is not based on color” (which really does beg the question of what relationships are, unless you are a slaveowner – or Roger Stone) and in his offer as further proof of his color-blind munificence of the depth of his relationship with his nephews and nieces who, he quick to inform us, are also “people of color. (By the same logic, if having a family member from a discriminated group disqualifies you from harboring bigotry toward that group, misogynists should not exist, assuming, of course, they have mothers.) Still, I imagine that if Meadows had been forewarned of Tlaib’s objection, he might have had them seated behind him during the hearing to serve as his own protective props. Mind you, this is the same man who as a congressional candidate in 2012 said Barack Obama should be sent “home to Kenya, or wherever it is.” While evidently Meadows does not have a bromance with Obama, like Lisanti, it would appear he does not know how those pesky little words snuck into and came out of his mouth, a matter that might be easily clarified if the media deigned to pose the question to him. In the meantime, perhaps a national emergency should be declared to build a wall between his brain and his mouth, at least until his relatives of color are sent back to their land of origin.

・The new normal is CNN holding a town hall with presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and taking questions from the audience without fully disclosing to viewers the background of those questioners, many of whom, it turns out, far from being everyday Americans, are political operatives, a line of work with which CNN is keenly familiar and proud to reward given its recent decision to hire as its new political editor Sarah Isgur Flores, someone who while no stranger to the profession has no journalistic bona fides whatsoever. Fake journalism? Perhaps not, but certainly unfair in a media landscape hell bent on taking down progressive democratic socialists by misdirection and editorial hit jobs that would give David Copperfield and Steve Pecker, respectively, a run for the money.

・The new normal is Ivanka Trump presuming to speak for these average Joes and Janes by proclaiming, “I don’t think most Americans, in their heart, want to be given something.” No living wage and Green jobs for these self-reliant, by-your-bootstraps, red-blooded Americans. Still, at the risk of stating the obvious, Ivanka Trump is not most Americans, having benefited from her doting father’s inherited wealth. Why settle on bootstraps when you can outsource the work to Chinese and Ethiopian sweatshop workers to manufacture them for even lower wages.

・The new normal is a government that celebrates family values while, under the direction of its own would-be Maduro, it forcibly separated immigrant children from their parents, resulting, when the policy was reversed, in its failure to place unknown thousands of them back with their families. Had America existed in a state of true normalcy – old or new – this tragedy would not have been allowed to happen in the first place.

・The new normal, borrowing a page from America’s nativist past, rejects Emma Lazarus’s“Give me your tired poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free/The wretched refuse of your teeming shore/Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me/ I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”– as it presses to replace that golden door with a steel wall along its southern border. As the New York Times reported in February 2018, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that issues green cards and grants citizenship dropped the phrase “a nation of immigrants” from its mission statement, a sobering sign that our nativist past is beginning to look more and more like our nativist future.

・The new normal devotes several hours a day to Jussie Smollett while the plot by Christopher P. Hasson, U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant, white nationalist, and Charles Manson wannabe, to start a race war garners only a modicum of national attention, not surprising since the media reserves its most sensationalist coverage for suspected Muslim terrorists, despite the fact that, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, white, right-wing groups on the rise and are responsible for the majority of incidents of domestic terrorism. Moreover, if, in fact, Smollett did lie, its consequences serve not only to undermine victims of real hate crimes but also to provide a pretext for the Chicago Police Department– which, according to a 2017 U.S. Department of Justice investigation, treated minorities “as animals and subhumans” and tortured hundreds of suspects to coerce false confessions – to present itself as professional, a matter which Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who lamented the lack of media attention on gun violence, has yet to confront with equal passion.

・Last but by all means not least, the new normal swaps out white hoods for blue police uniforms; though the strange fruit it produces does not dangle from trees but is captured on cell phones and uploaded to the Internet, providing photographic evidence that while the means of execution has changed, the continued disregard for those lives remains, with no Kerner Commission in sight to offer even a pretense that they matter to a society ostensibly based on the rule of law."

Let’s talk about Jussie Smollett and the mess that is the reporting of the racist and homophobic attack in January. When reports of the attack happened with Smollett ending up in hospital, many celebrities and the LGBTQI+ community showed their support for the Empire actor on social media. As the weeks went on, however, the story took a turn for the weird after the Chicago police department started investigating the incident. Unnamed sources claimed the attack was staged. Another source claimed that Smollett sent himself the letter that said: “You will die black f*g”. The FBI later stated that they couldn’t confirm nor deny that he sent it to himself, but the Chicago police claimed that Smollett staged the attack to up his Empire fee. It hits close to home, being a queer person of colour myself. As the news developed I grew more and more frustrated with the carelessness with which misinformation was being distributed. When it comes to hate crimes, black people in America are always targeted, not to mention homophobia on top of that.

The thing that people don’t understand about reckless reporting is that it gives victim-blamers more ammo. It gives those victim-blamers more reason to discredit hate crime victims.

Whether Smollett is lying or telling the truth at this stage should not be the main concern. He is rich, famous and attractive and can use these attributes to shield him for the most part from daily harassment faced by normal QPOC (queer people of colour).

Trans women especially come off the worst and there are stories daily about a different trans woman being killed in hate crime-related attacks.

It’s also quite suspicious that the Chicago police processed Smollett’s case so quickly while they dragged their feet when it came to R. Kelly, who was only recently arrested in Chicago for 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, some involving minors.

I believe this is to be a clear indication of underlining homophobia and the fact they are unable to stop information from leaking to the public is alarming.

I really hope that Smollett is not lying and is telling the truth, purely so that people who have been looking for an example of people lying about racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic attacks can’t point to this scenario, since it will only make it harder for these disenfranchised victims to come forward without being ridiculed by those who think they are not telling the truth."

No broader group ought to be implicated by their actions.

But when an individual who has been part of the arts and activism world his entire life designs a scheme that is perfectly calibrated to manipulate the dominant intellectual paradigm of the moment - and swaths of prominent people and platforms fall for it - well then we need to ask some hard questions about broader problems.

Consider the story that Jussie Smollett told. He was out with a Subway Sandwich at 2 am in downtown Chicago during a historic cold front, where he was somehow recognized and attacked by two men in MAGA hats who yelled racist and homophobic slurs, poured bleach in his face and threw a noose around his neck. Amongst the many curious facts of his story: He held on to his sandwich and kept the noose around his neck as he entered the lobby of his building.

And consider how so many of us responded. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both Senators and candidates for President, called it a “modern day lynching”.

The New York Times published a piece in its Race/Related newsletter in which the writer stated: “Reading about the attack on Mr. Smollett reminded me … that being black and queer presents a unique challenge: We have to fight twice as hard for acceptance, and often within our own communities. Our marginalized identities increase our chances of both racist and homophobic attacks.”

Robin Roberts on Good Morning America did a cupcake interview with Smollett in which he cried and said, “… it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Every single one of these supposedly credible and responsible entities, and countless others, simply assumed that the events had happened precisely as Smollett had said and used the case as an opportunity to offer a diversity progressive critique of the larger culture.

Well, to borrow a line from Mr. Smollett: What does it say about the place we are in as a country right now that an individual can safely assume that a story with several fishy details is immediately embraced not just by progressive activists but by mainstream politicians and news platforms who don’t even do basic fact checking before using it as an opportunity to blare their worldview to the world?

And that, even once the Chief of Police in Chicago (a black man) presented credible evidence that not only was Jussie Smollett’s story a pack of lies, but that he had concocted it for the stunningly selfish purpose of pressing for a higher payday for his role on the television show Empire, the great Ava Duvernay decides to tweet out her general suspicions about the police, rather than any particular frustration with Jussie Smollett.

I think what the Smollett case reveals is the dangers of identity politics when it is the dominant and exclusive intellectual paradigm that people employ.

To recognize that black and gay people are more likely to be victims of identity-based attacks in an era of racially-polarized politics and rising hate crimes is perfectly legitimate. To immediately believe a person because of his identity and entirely fail to employ other modes of intellectual inquiry – like interrogating the facts – is to fall into a trap.

Indeed, one test of an intellectual paradigm is whether it serves as a reliable guide to help you make sense of reality. The sine qua non of identity politics as a totalizing paradigm is that the most significant details of any given case are the race, gender and sexuality of the people involved. Those identities determine who you believe, what you see and which side you take. Whatever other facts, dynamics or dimensions might be at play are all secondary.

This is precisely what Jussie Smollett was relying on as he concocted his hoax. He knew that there would be enough prominent people out there in politics, pop culture, activism, thought leadership, the media and liberal twitter to create a blizzard of support that might just snow over the facts of the case.

It is interesting to note that identity politics as a totalizing paradigm is not something that we would normally accept in the human endeavors in which concrete reality really matters. If you ask someone for directions, and that individual gives you a lecture about the racist history of the transportation system, you might find it interesting but not especially relevant. And you would likely be pretty angry if that individual gave you a map of where to go based on her history lesson, and it landed you in the wrong place.

The same is true for most professions. If you go see your dentist and say your tooth hurts, and your dentist notes your race, gender, age and sexuality and says you need a root canal, without ever looking into your mouth, he loses credibility.

There has to be some happy medium between identity determining everything and identity counting for nothing.

I think we should apply the ‘does this help me see reality more clearly’ test to identity politics more often. If you assume, based mostly on the identities and social positions of the people involved, things are true that turn out to be false, you lose credibility. If you ignore relevant facts, you lose credibility. If you are constantly pointing to a partial picture of the world rather than making a good faith effort to gain and present a fuller picture, you lose credibility.

And it’s not like the Jussie Smollett case is the first time identity politics as a totalizing paradigm was a spectacular failure. Remember the Duke lacrosse case?

The single most important currency that intellectuals and academics have is credibility. In my mind, here is what credibility boils down to: the things you say, the predictions you make, the interpretations you offer, the directions you give … they turn out to be true."

Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts has spoken out about her infamous interview with Empire star Jussie Smollett, claiming she was in a 'no-win situation', no matter what questions she asked him.

The interview which aired on February 14 saw Smollett give further details about an attack that he suffered while out early one morning on the streets of Chicago.

But just a few days after the interview with Roberts, Smollett's story unraveled as it emerged he likely made the whole things up and was charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report claiming he was the victim of a hate-crime attack in the city.

Roberts, 58, told an audience in Brooklyn on Monday that she tried to be as neutral as possible in her questioning of Smollett, but knew that it was a tricky line to follow.

'I'm a black gay woman, he's a black gay man,' she said as she spoke about the pressure she felt to represent the LGBT community.

The Good Morning America host said that her identity as a gay woman of color would play into the public's perception of how she handled the Empire actor who is also gay

Jussie Smollett showed up two-and-half-hours late for his ABC interview with Robin Roberts last week which raised suspicion on set. He then wept throughout their conversation and angrily denied making up that he had been attacked

'He's saying that there's a hate crime, so if I'm too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, 'You don't believe a brother,' if I'm too light on him, it's like, 'Oh, because you are in the community, you're giving him a pass.''

'It was a no-win situation for me,' she explained.

'I pride myself in being fair, I know how much work went into being balanced about what had happened and to challenge him on certain things,' she said.

'I'll be completely honest, I was like I don't know if I want to do the interview or not,' the GMA host said during a Q&A session, as reported by Page Six.

'I said, 'I don't want to sit down with him if he's going to 'lawyer up', and then I was told, ""He wants to speak with you,"" [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.'

Roberts spoke out about feeling like she was in a 'no-win situation' when it came to interviewing the actor and musician who was arrested on felony charges on February 21 for falsifying a police report

Roberts told the crowd that she was hesitant to do the interview because she thought Smollett would 'lawyer up' but that she decided to go with it because he wanted to speak with her

SMOLLETT'S GMA REMARKS 'You do such a disservice when you lie about stuff like this.' 'He says, 'This MAGA country n****!' and punches me right in the face. So I punch his a** back. We end up tussling by the stairs, fighting, fighting, fighting...and then it just stopped.' 'I looked down and I noticed a rope around my neck and I started screaming, 'There's a f****** rope around me neck!' 'It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more. That says a lot about the place that we are at in the country right now.' 'I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f*** back. They ran off,' I didn't.' 'I still want to believe there's something called justice.' 'I've heard that it was a date gone bad which I so resent that narrative. I'm not going to go out to get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous and offensive. 'They called me a f****t. I don't need to add anything like that. I don't need to make MAGA hat the cherry on the top of some racist sundae.' 'I will never be the man that this did not happen to... I am forever changed. Advertisement

Roberts was also told that during the interview she would be allowed to challenge him on 'red flags' and various discrepancies in his story.

'They said, ""He wants to say things that he has not said"" and I'm like, ""As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he's going to go on record for the first time, yes I'll do the interview,''' she explained.

But things didn't get off to a great start with Smollett arriving two-and-a-half hours late for the interview.

'I sit down with him, and I don't know what he's going to say,' she said at the event, as reported by the New York Post.

'Following up about how he couldn't believe people didn't believe him, well I go, 'You're out 2 o'clock in the morning, you're getting a sandwich, and you won't give up your phone.''

Two days later it emerged that two Nigerian brothers alleged they had been paid by the Smollett to stage the attack.

'People are looking at the interview through the eyes of 'How did you not know?'' Roberts said. 'I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.'

She noted that since Smollett was considered by police as a victim and not a suspect at the time of the interview, but questions surrounding his cooperation with their probe were growing as sources within the Chicago Police Department leaked more and more information about the case.

'It was one of the most challenging interviews I've ever had to do,' she said.

After the interview was wrapped up, a number of ABC staffers said they were skeptical of Smollett's story.

Roberts said the developments in the case were a 'setback for race relations, homophobia, MAGA supporters – the fingers were pointed at them.'

It appears their hunch may have been correct. A week after the brothers came forward to shed details on how the attack was orchestrated, Smollett turned himself in to police.

Some staffers within the network say he 'took advantage' of Roberts and used her as he wept and protested his innocence. Others say she did her job perfectly and was in total control.

'I cannot think of another case where there's this anger on so many sides, and you can understand why there would be,' she added, later saying the interview was 'difficult' to watch back.

Staffers at ABC say she did nothing wrong and could not have helped the 'bad optics' which now surround their interview because, at the time, police were still officially calling Smollett a victim and not a suspect.

Their interview was the first time Smollett had answered questions about the case publicly

'It was an interview everyone wanted. There's not really a spirit of regret about the Jussie interview.

Jussie Smollett is shown in his mugshot on Thursday morning

'And no one feels that Robin got duped.

'Taken advantage of, yes, but not duped.'

'She did her job as a journalist and conducted an incredibly newsworthy interview,' one production source said.

Within a few hours of Smollett's interview being aired, Chicago Police Department announced it had identified the two men in the surveillance video that had been circulated for weeks beforehand.

The two men are Abel and Ola Osundairo who were picked up by officers as they returned to Chicago on February 13 from Nigeria.

During the interview, Smollett reacted to suspicion over his cooperation with the police investigation by insisting he was telling the truth.

'You do such a disservice when you lie about this kind of stuff,' he said.

Elsewhere he described himself 'fighting the f*** back' when he was jumped, screaming as he realized there was a noose around his neck and then calling the police with his 60-year-old friend Frank Gatson.

He blamed the fact that he was being doubted on the political climate and said: 'The camera, facing north, how is that my issue? It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.'

He also raised his voice when asked by Roberts about the fact people were suspicious he had gone out in subzero temperatures at 2am to get a salad from Subway.

'Subway is open for 24 hours. People kill me when they say stuff like that because Subway is open 24 hours for a reason so that when you're hungry at night and you ain't got no food, you go to Subway!' he said.

Choking back tears, he explained when asked why it took so long for him to contact the authorities: 'There is a level of pride there.

'We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.'

Smollett's lawyers insist he is innocent and say he has been treated unfairly by the police and the prosecutor's office. His next court appearance is on March 14."

This has resulted in the fractionalizing of our country into more and more “tribes” unwilling to even listen to those with a different point of view.

Jussie Smollett and the Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann were front-page news for weeks. As soon as these “hate crimes” were found to have been committed by President Trump’s opponents, they vanished. At best the truth got a few column inches on Page 2.

Some, such as the Washington Post, didn’t report the truth at all, and social media continues to present them as coming from the right. But then there are those still selling, “Hands up, don’t shoot” as gospel and holding memorials for Trayvon Martin.

Several younger (in their late 30s and 40s) members of our family only learned Smollett was arrested when they stopped by and saw the headline in your Opinion section. When asked if they had heard Sandmann was suing the Washington Post for defaming him, they were even more shocked.

Which liar? Michael Cohen or the president?

Re “Michael Cohen says Trump behaved ‘much like a mobster would do’” (Feb. 28):

I saw the House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing with Michael Cohen. One questioner accused Cohen about being a pathological liar and Cohen replied: “Are you referring to me or the president?”

Cohen has admitted to many lies and shows remorse. Pathological liars rarely admit to lies and show remorse. Cohen’s statements are backed-up by a well-known newspaper that was mentioned in the hearing; it has documented, fact-checked and tallied our president’s prevarications. The hearing pointed out that they number in the thousands.

I was so happy to get outside and work in the sunshine. My neighbor asked if I were a juror, would I believe Cohen. I had to think and then replied that I would believe most of what Cohen might say but with a grain of salt. That evening, a telephone solicitor asked the exact same thing. Some must think Cohen can never be truthful and become patriotic.

Using insignificant news event to bash Trump

Re “British invasion and Mr. Larouche” (Opinion, Feb. 24):

Columnist and Southern California News Group editorial board member Larry Wilson has done it yet again. He has parsed a semi-insignificant news event, the death of Lyndon LaRouche, from the headlines in order to bash Donald Trump.

Wilson’s logic is that LaRouche was crazy, and, therefore, so is Trump. That was about all I got from his idiotic writing. Doesn’t Wilson get it? By calling our president “the man in the tin-foil hat,” he is also calling all of us, who voted for him, the same.

Trump won the presidency and still has high approval numbers in spite of constant attacks from the likes of Wilson. If only LaRouche was as crazy as that.

Wilson tries to lure you in with articles that sound, by the headline, as if they will be lightweight and pleasant. Then, more than half the time, about a sentence or two in, you realize you’ve been had, and it’s all an excuse to say something bad about his president. Our president. America’s president.

Speed bumps in life

Re “University of La Verne students say racism and gender inequality issues are systemic, demand change” (Feb. 24):

It seems that about 35 students at the University of LaVerne consider that some speed bumps in life, which we all have to contend with, to be a series of microaggressions.

Poor little snowflakes. Let’s watch and wait to see if the university caves. Things have sure changed at my old alma mater.

Nearly a month later, he faces felony charges and exile.

Smollett has been charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. The police and the state attorney’s office have confirmed that the charges are in response to evidence that suggests Smollett staged his own attack. If convicted, he could face up to three years in jail.

As a fan of “Empire,” it has been hard for me to see Smollett in this position. I’ve tried to remain impartial, but the truth is, I want to believe he didn’t do it. Unfortunately, many people do not feel the same way. Celebrities quickly deleted any tweets that were in support of Smollett and fans bombarded Twitter with posts featuring the hashtag “#JussieSmollettHoax.”

This incident is an example of how the social spotlight can be like a magnifying glass under the sun capable of destruction. We are supposed to believe that people are innocent until proven guilty, and Smollett has not been proven guilty. There is still a chance that he did not orchestrate the attack and if that is the case, people have been victimizing the victim and falsely accusing an innocent black man from the LGBTQ+ community.

Whether or not Smollett is innocent, I want to reiterate what Emma Cohen said in the Clarion’s last article about him. We shouldn’t let all of the controversy surrounding this story detract from other stories of hate. It’s unfortunate that something like this has to happen for us to acknowledge these injustices but at least now, we can reflect upon the facts. The FBI determined in their national analysis that over 7,000 hate crimes occur each year. In a survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, it was determined that 250,000 hate crimes occur each year. There is a large discrepancy between these two numbers but that’s not the focus. The focus is on the fact that there are any hate crimes at all because hate crimes do not just coincide with your news feed."

On the same day that one of my foreign students told me he didn’t understand why Americans valued individual freedoms over the betterment of the whole.

On that same day, a place called Constitution Hall became a place of hope. And it wasn’t because Jon Meacham, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and presidential historian, told those who braved icy weather to hear him say that history is not a “bedtime story, a fairy tale.”

“There will never be a happily ever after.”

A couple of hours earlier, I had met Meacham at a University of Central Oklahoma reception. After I was introduced as the endowed chair of journalism ethics, he immediately asked, “How do you define media to your students.”

I responded, “Both traditional media and social.” That was less than 24 hours after Lady Gaga told Jimmy Kimmel that, “… Social media, quite frankly, is the toilet of the internet” after it raged with rumors about her and actor Bradley Cooper because of their Academy Awards performance. Then a few minutes after Meacham’s talk ended, I was in line to get his The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels signed for a friend. I told him how much I enjoyed his talk. Without looking up, he smirked, “Good luck with that ethics.”

I laughed. I laughed a lot during his talk. For example, he told a story about a woman who rushed up to him at the Washington Mall and exclaimed, “It’s You!” She then asked him to wait while she rushed to get his book so he could sign it. She then presented him with John Grisham’s The Runaway Jury, which he obliged by signing with Grisham’s name.

Later when he told the Bushes the story, Barbara Bush quipped, “How do you think John Grisham would feel? He’s such a very handsome man.”

And perhaps his humor was needed, considering the seriousness of what he was conveying about our country’s current state.

As he talked, I thought about some recent stories that had troubled me beyond Trump’s repeated social media attacks on the press, including the most recent one after another Saturday Night Live parody, in which he tweeted, “THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.” Trump’s latest tweet was about the time a now disgraced Alabama publisher declared in an editorial that it was “Time for the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again” and suggested mass lynchings to clean out Washington. At about the same time that suspended Empire star Jussie Smollett allegedly fabricated a story that two masked men attacked him and shouted racial and homophobic slurs while yelling “This is MAGA country,” Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan.

All this while reading and hearing from Meacham that the American public’s trust in government has reached an all-time low.

So why is Constitution Hall a place of hope?

Because of how Meacham talked about history’s lessons and what we’ve been through in the past: the Civil War, World Wars, the Klan, Hitler, McCarthyism. Despite all this, he said, we have endured. And should have hope because of the Constitution, including the First Amendment that guarantees our individual and country’s freedoms.

“The Constitution was written for moments like this,” Meacham said.

On those days, during these times, we must remember that.

Roberts interviewed Smollett in an episode that aired February 13, two weeks after the actor said he was assaulted in the early morning hours in his Chicago neighborhood by two men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him and tied a rope around his neck. Since the interview, Chicago police have said they believe Smollett staged the attack, and may have paid two brothers $3,500 to carry out the alleged hate crime. Smollett was charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a fake police report, and the brothers were arrested and released without being charged, before testifying before a grand jury.

Smollett has not spoken publicly since his arrest, but his lawyers have maintained his innocence.

According to the New York Post, Roberts spoke about the interview during a “How I Get it Done” event hosted by The Cut.

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,” Roberts said, explaining that she didn’t want to do an on-air interview Smollett is he was going to “lawyer up.”

But she overcame her reservations because she recognized that it was a newsworthy discussion, and understood that Smollett wanted to speak to her specifically because he was angry that people doubted his story. The interview was recorded before the two brothers believed to be connected to the incident were arrested.

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview,’” Roberts reportedly said, adding that she anticipated criticism no matter how she handled the interview.

“I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man … He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.’”

“It was a no-win situation for me,” Roberts said, according to the newspaper.

Roberts also said she would have handled the interview differently if she had known about the alleged involvement of the two brothers and the suspected payoff.

“Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that,” she said. “I pride myself in being fair, I know how much work went into being balanced about what had happened and to challenge him on certain things.”

Smollett is free on bail and due back in court on March 14.

Many felt she went too easy on the embattled actor, who stands accused of faking the crime as part of an elaborate PR stunt because he was allegedly unhappy with his wages from the hit FOX music drama series.

Now, Roberts is responding to the critics and finally sharing how she really feels about their highly publicized conversation.

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,” she said during The Cut’s “How I Get It Done” event at 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge on Monday, Page Six reports.

“I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up,’” Roberts recalled. “And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

Roberts wanted to challenge him on some of the more questionable parts of his version of what he said went down on that cold Chicago night. Roberts asserts that she had hoped to get new information out of him.

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview,’” she explained.

Roberts also acknowledged the pressure she felt to properly represent the LGBT community.

“I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man,” she said. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.’”

“It was a no-win situation for me,” she explained.

Because Smollett was considered a victim at the time of their interview, she carefully selected her questions.

“There’s so many people who do not come forward because others are not believed. I don’t know how this is all going to end,” she said. “We still talk to the [Chicago] police superintendent [Eddie T. Johnson].”

“It was one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do,” she said.

Following the interview, it has been alleged that ABC staffers expressed their doubts about Smollett’s story.

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like, ‘I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,'” she said. “I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up.'”

Roberts said Smollett wanted to sit down with her because he was angry about people not believing his story. However, Roberts was told she could ask him questions regarding the alleged attack. (RELATED: ‘Good Morning America’ Host Robin Roberts Breaks Silence On Jussie Smollett Interview)

However, many believe Roberts didn’t press him enough during the interview. She did catch some criticism for the way she conducted the interview.

“He’s a celebrity besides being a victim. He’s an actor and that was a celebrity interview more than a news person interview,” CNN Analyst Bill Carter said during “Reliable Sources.” “Instead of getting to the facts, it was much more about him and the effects on him.”

On “Reliable Sources” when prompted “The Fifth Column” podcast co-host Kmele Foster spoke about how Roberts didn’t press Smollett enough and didn’t ask the right questions.

“Robin Roberts in that interview had an opportunity to say ‘You know, Jussie, there are practical reasons for someone to ask questions about something like this that have nothing to do with your race or sexuality,'” Foster said. “She didn’t do that and there are far too many instances where serious journalists aren’t doing that.”

Roberts‘ interview aired after the news broke that Smollett had paid the two brothers to attack him, leading people to question how she didn’t know that it had happened.

“I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.” Roberts noted that at the time of the interview Smollett was still considered a victim and that she chose her questions accordingly.

Roberts also talked about the pressure she felt being a part of the LGBT community. “It was a no-win situation for me,” she told The Cut. “It was one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do.”"

Smollett case undermines the public trust

The crime that actor Jussie Smollett is charged with inflicting on the American public goes beyond any spelled out in a law book.

He is accused of using his celebrity status to exploit the racial and homophobic tensions in this country to boost his television show ratings and get a pay raise.

Staging an assault on himself in hopes of gaining public sympathy will result in tremendous pain and suffering. Such false claims undermine those who are true victims of hate crimes.

The media have also taken a bashing on this case for their reporting. Some perceived that news account were either too believing of Smollett or slanted against him before the case began to unravel.

The alleged assault, reported more than four weeks ago, had all the elements of a made-for-television script. Smollett said he was attacked in Chicago by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs, poured a liquid on him and threw a noose around his neck.

Smollett was indicted by a grand jury recently. Court documents allege the actor, a member of the “Empire” cast, a Fox Network television show, paid two acquaintances $3,500 to carry out the assault.

He has been charged with felony misconduct for the filing of a false police report and faces up to three years in prison.

No amount of jail time and no fine can began to compensate for the likely collateral damage he has caused if the charges against him are true.

The case has prompted outrage and disbelief, including from Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who was responsible for the investigation into Smollett’s allegations.

Johnson, who is black, expressed shock that anyone would take “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

“Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?” Johnson said at a news conference.

So how do the rest of us react? Simply, we cannot allow this bizarre case to make us jaded or calloused — suspicious of even credible claims.

Here are the things to remember: Hate groups and crime against people because of their race and sexual orientation are serious problems in our country.

The FBI reported a 30 percent increase in hate crimes between 2014 and 2017. And the South Poverty Law Center notes on its website that it has identified 1,020 hate groups in the United States.

Racism and homophobia are quite real. We mustn’t allow this case to blunt the way we respond to them."
