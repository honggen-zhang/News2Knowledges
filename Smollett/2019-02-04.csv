During the promotion of his upcoming film Cold Pursuit, Neeson gave an interview to The Independent in which he exposed himself as not only racist but also someone who apparently feels that admitting he once had racist thoughts absolves him of being called racist anymore.

During the interview, which began as a typical Q and A regarding his film, which is about revenge, Neeson told an anecdote about the time a friend confided in him that she had been raped. “I asked, did she know who it was? No. What colour were they? She said it was a black person,” the actor recounted to the reporter. “I went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I’d be approached by somebody—I’m ashamed to say that—and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some ‘black bastard’ would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him,” he said.

Neeson then attempted to demonstrate the “lesson” he learned from walking around for weeks with a rageful intention to kill a black man. “It was horrible, horrible, when I think back, that I did that. And I’ve never admitted that, and I’m saying it to a journalist. God forbid,” Neeson said. “It’s awful, but I did learn a lesson from it, when I eventually thought, ‘What the fuck are you doing,’ you know?” he continued. According to the reporter conducting the interview, this shocked Neeson’s costar Tom Bateman, who could only utter, “Holy shit.”

This admission from Neeson is more than just an unscripted answer in an interview that turned out to be a PR disaster for the actor. It is also extremely bad timing, especially considering the news broke less than a week after Virginia’s governor, Ralph Northam, admitted to appearing in a photo wearing blackface and the Empire actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago in an alleged hate crime that targeted the actor for being black and gay. Neeson’s admission that he had once held the desire to carry out a racist attack against a member of a group that is disproportionately targeted in hate crimes and hypersexualized also prompted an appropriately upset response on social media from actors and comedians, like Terry Crews.

The unquestionable racism of Neeson’s remarks—that any random black man’s life is worth taking in the name of revenge—cannot be any clearer, and his admission of it does not make it any less toxic.

To align with societal expectations, some men wear business suits during the week and athletic attire on the weekend. In my community, men assume heterosexuality when meeting other men.

What happens when you do not fit beliefs consistent with dominant understandings of masculinity and sexuality? You are often shunned and sometimes attacked. Harmful consequences can appear unavoidable to members of marginalized communities, where systemic and individualized racism converges to create injustices.

Last week, some of us learned about the case involving actor and singer Jussie Smollett. Smollett was the victim of a hate crime while visiting Chicago. He was out late one evening when two men attacked him. These unknown men yelled racial and homophobic slurs, before hitting Smollett in the face, pouring an unknown chemical powder on him, and placing a rope around his neck. Referencing the “Make America Great Again” slogan, Smollett has also stated that the men said, “this is MAGA country.”

As someone born in Chicago, I was disturbed to read about the incident. I was concerned about Smollett and bothered by another dosage of negative media exposure highlighting the violence of my hometown. Although the Smollett case occurred in a neighborhood that is often not reported as having challenges with violence, it adds to the narrative that Chicago is a dangerous place. Without a doubt, Chicago has its problems, but the Smollett case is indicative of a broader agenda that plagues all major and minor cities throughout the world.

Jussie Smollett identifies as a Black gay man. He does not fit into the dominant understandings that often correspond with manhood and identity. Despite his talents in music and acting, there are segments of the population who are only able to see his race and sexual orientation. Smollett’s identity is related to the allegations that his assault claims are part of a political ploy and did not happen.

We must be willing to disrupt notions of power, prestige, masculinity, and sexual identity with the intention to achieve social justice. Regardless of the agenda put forth by the current administration and their supporters, it is time that we expand definitions of manhood. I respect Bobby Rush’s campaign to push for a full civil rights investigation in the Smollett incident.

As men, women, fluid, gay, heterosexual, bisexual, or however you identify in 2019, we need to tap into the courage required to respond to injustices. Our unique contributions may include engaging in a protest, posting content on social media, or participating in another means to let others know that attacking someone, because of their race and sexual identity is not okay. Standing up for something you believe in is not easy, but it is necessary if your goals include making this world a better place.

As you begin this first week of Black history month, remember our ancestors and challenge the status quo. Decide that you will not allow others to define you or your potential to make a positive influence on the lives of others. Step into authentic leadership and transcend conventional thinking."

BY ALEJANDRA O’CONNELL-DOMENECH | Despite the freezing temperature, L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. community members and allies rallied at Manhattan’s Grand Army Plaza last Friday in solidarity with Jussie Smollett, who suffered an alleged hate-crime attack early last week in Chicago.

The openly gay black actor is known for his portrayal of Jamal Lyon on the TV series “Empire.”

The event, near the southeast corner of Central Park, drew about 100 people and was organized by VOCAL New York.

“I am infuriated with what happened to Jussie,” said Angelica Torres, a model and transgender advocate who spoke at the Feb. 1 rally.

On Tues., Jan. 29, Smollett told Chicago police that while walking in the Streetsville neighborhood at 2 a.m. that morning he was attacked by two men who punched him in the face while shouting racial and homophobic slurs. The two unknown attackers then allegedly poured an unknown chemical substance on Smollett and tied a rope around his neck.

Those rallying in support of Smollett say the attack proves that the rhetoric and policies of President Donald Trump are promoting more violence against groups who are already targeted for and vulnerable to attacks.

According to police, Smollett was still wearing the rope when they arrived. The actor then checked himself into Northwestern Hospital and was released in good condition.

The two men were also allegedly yelling, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” And according to The Chicago Tribune, Smollett had previously received a threatening letter in a white envelope with the word “MAGA” written on the upper left-hand corner. Those at the rally said the attack is further proof that MAGA is a racist and homophobic slogan.

“This is no isolated incident,” Torres declared. “This happens every single day to L.G.B.T.Q.I. people and people of color.”

And not all are as lucky as Jussie, they noted.

The demonstrators also called for justice Candance Towns and Dana Martin. Towns, a black transgender woman who was killed in Macon, Georgia, was the 23rd transgender person to be murdered in the U.S. in 2017.

Martin, a black transgender Alabama woman, was found shot to death in her vehicle in Montgomery in January. Her death is this year’s first known murder of a transgender woman.

According to a report from the Human Rights Campaign since 2013 the organization has documented at least 128 transgender people who were victims of fatal violence. At least 110 of them were transgender people of color. According to HRC’s Web site, about nine out of 10 of these victims were transgender women with 45 percent of all deaths occurring in the U.S. South. The amount of violence endured by transgender people within the last five years has been labeled an “epidemic” by HRC.

“This is bigger than Jussie,” said activist and author James Felton Keith, who is the founder of Slay TV. Keith spoke about his reluctance to hold his husband’s hand in public out of fear of having bottles thrown at them.

“I hope you all will join us outside of here, especially those who are not queer people of color,” he said. “We need your support because all of us are risking our lives just coming out of the front door every morning.”

Keith then invited all those in attendance to attend the Trans March on Washington, which is scheduled to take place April 1."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

On Monday, Bennett College, an all-female historically black college in Greensboro, North Carolina, announced that it had surpassed its fundraising goal of $5 million to help keep its accreditation and stay open, WXII reported.

At a 90-minute gathering, school officials announced that they had raised $8.2 million.

In December, students, alumnae and administration officials at Bennett were tasked with a seemingly impossible goal: raise $5 million or risk losing accreditation and closing its doors. After the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges voted to terminate Bennett's accreditation late last year, raising the money became a community-wide effort.

Alumnae, like Shawn Hall ’93, joined a committee called Change and Progress for Bennett, which she described as a “brain trust” in an earlier interview with NBC News.

“We formed to ensure the fiscal stability of Bennett College,” said Hall, who runs a small business called All Roads Education, which helps prospective students attend college debt free. “We plan on tracking down and pursuing every avenue to keep Bennett open by putting our heads together and reflecting on what we do well.”

Other supporters, including celebrities like the actor Jussie Smollett, posted on social media using #StandWithBennett in order to persuade others to donate to their cause.

“In the 1930s we had 121 #HBCUs now we’re at 101,” Smollett wrote on Instagram. “Don’t let us be down to 100 if #BennettCollege, who has made the education of black women a priority since 1926, closes its doors.”

Although Bennett has met its financial goal, the school still has to undergo a formal appeal for its accreditation on Feb. 18. Community members will learn the accreditation board’s decision on Feb. 25.

In the meantime, Bennett’s family and friends are celebrating this initial victory.

“WE’VE SURPASSED OUR GOAL. WE RAISED $8.2 MILLION DOLLARS!!,” Alexis Mitchell, a journalist at WBTV News wrote on Twitter. “Everyday is a day of Thanksgiving.”

In promoting his newest film Cold Pursuit, a film in which I’m sure he kills a whole bunch of people, Liam Neeson had an interview with the Independent in which he, unprompted, relayed a story about his friend being raped, allegedly by a Black man, and then walking through the area looking for a Black man to kill. It is disgusting, unnerving and the way the author of the piece tries to frame it adds about layer to this:

“She handled the situation of the rape in the most extraordinary way,” Neeson says. “But my immediate reaction was…” There’s a pause. “I asked, did she know who it was? No. What colour were they? She said it was a black person. “I went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I’d be approached by somebody – I’m ashamed to say that – and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some [Neeson gestures air quotes with his fingers] ‘black bastard’ would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could,” another pause, “kill him.” Neeson clearly knows what he’s saying, and how shocking it is, how appalling. “It took me a week, maybe a week and a half, to go through that. She would say, ‘Where are you going?’ and I would say, ‘I’m just going out for a walk.’ You know? ‘What’s wrong?’ ‘No no, nothing’s wrong.’” He deliberately withholds details to protect the identity of the victim. “It was horrible, horrible, when I think back, that I did that,” he says. “And I’ve never admitted that, and I’m saying it to a journalist. God forbid.” “Holy shit,” says Tom Bateman, his co-star, who is sitting beside him. “It’s awful,” Neeson continues, a tremble in his breath. “But I did learn a lesson from it, when I eventually thought, ‘What the fuck are you doing,’ you know?”

Holy shit indeed. The audio is there to accompany the quotes, so there is no “taking it out of context”—he admitted on the record that he wanted to do this. He didn’t even specify that he wanted to specifically get vengeance for his friend, but just for any “black bastard” who might look at him the wrong way. It’s horrifying. Especially coming after the racist and homophobic beating of Jussie Smollett.

Also, in reading the piece I don’t really see how he “learned a lesson”; it more sounds like his temper tantrum burned out and then he was left with the sobering reality that he had been a racist. Which he could have, quite frankly, kept to his damn self. He didn’t even say “I was a racist and I’ve had to work to unlearn that.” Just “what the fuck are you doing?” and that’s pretty much what the entire internet is saying right now.

What’s more is that the interviewer decided to reach out to an associate professor of experimental psychology at University College London named Lasana Harris to discuss the comments without revealing Neeson’s identity. Harris said “incidents as abhorrent as rape can shape the way someone thinks about a specific community” and that “our minds can generalise a negative experience with a person by categorising them in a way that may be flawed.”

When it comes to the Black community across the world, the hypersexualization of the Black man has been used as an excuse to kill them since the very beginning. You want to get justice for your friend, you feel anger towards one Black man, in particular, that is one thing. To stalk the streets waiting for the first Black man to piss you off, so you can live you Birth of a Nation-style revenge fantasy isn’t a normal thought process if you don’t already have hatred against Black people in your mind.

We let you hug up on Viola Davis and you let his nonsense out of your mouth? Ugh. It’s disgusting, and I’m sure there are people attempting to defend Neeson, but there is nothing to defend. You didn’t need to bring in a professor to clarify that.

""I have so many words on my heart that I want to say, but the most important thing I can say is thank you so much, and that I'm okay,"" the star of Fox television show Empire (2015 to present) told the sold-out crowd at the Troubadour nightclub in West Hollywood.

Smollett said that although he was not yet fully healed, ""I had to be here tonight"". He said he could not let his attackers win.

The crowd, which included Empire co-creator Lee Daniels and Representative Maxine Waters of California, roared in approval, though Smollett quickly followed by saying: ""Now let's have a good time.""

He began his set with a cover of Stevie Wonder's Love's In Need Of Love Today. Through his hour-long performance, he made clear his desire to move on from the assault.

""We're not going to harp on"" what happened, he said. Other than a small mark below his right eye, he showed no signs of injury, commanding the stage along with dancers and a backing band.

Chicago police are combing through security camera footage and have identified two ""potential persons of interest"", but lack of progress in the investigation has fuelled speculation online that the attack did not happen as Smollett described.

He addressed that speculation last Friday and again during his performance, as well as perceived inconsistencies regarding the severity of his injuries.

""There's been a lot of stuff that's been said about me that's absolutely not true,"" he said last Saturday, reading from a crumpled piece of paper. ""I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately.""

He said he was not hospitalised, and that ""above all, I fought back"".

Tickets for his show were still available as of last Tuesday afternoon, but sold out within 48 hours of the assault being reported.

The show, which took place Saturday, Feb. 2, had been booked in advance.

“I’m not fully healed yet but I’m going to and … I’m going to stand strong with y’all,” the Empire star told the crowd, a couple times holding back tears. “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those motherfuckers win,” referring to the two men he has said attacked him on Jan. 29 outside his Chicago apartment.

According to Smollett’s statement and a Chicago Police Department report, two men wearing ski masks approached him, placed a noose around his neck and doused him in a chemical substance. His attackers allegedly yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

At the Jussie Smollett performance, in between songs, he told the crowd there had been things set about him that were not true. He then pulled out a written list of four points he wanted to clear up.

“There’s just a couple of points I wanted to make really quick,” he said. “Four points. … I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately. … I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform. They said to take care, obviously. And, above all, I fought the fuck back.”

In his statement released the day before the L.A. performance, Smollett said, “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. … The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. … I still believe justice will be served.”

(AP) — Jussie Smollett was blunt, emotional and defiantly determined Saturday night at a Southern California concert some urged him not to play, telling the crowd before singing a note that he had to go on with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

“The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the “Empire” actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn’t do that.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,” he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

“And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,” he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she’s glad he did.

“It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,” Davis said. “He showed everyone in the room he was strong.”

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he’s not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in “Empire,” the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, “Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night’s set, along with songs from “Empire.”

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

“To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,” Joel Smollett Jr. said. “But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie’s healing. He’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.”"

Feb. 4 (UPI) -- The sentencing hearing for serial killer Bruce McArthur began in Toronto on Monday, after he pleaded guilty to eight counts of first-degree murder.

The hearing is expected to last three days. Graphic testimony about the slayings was presented to the court on Monday.

Last week, McArthur admitted to killing eight men over a seven-year period. He had sexual relationships with at least six of them. The victims were gay and killed in Toronto's predominately gay neighborhood, known as ""the Village."" All were strangled with a rope and pipe, and McArthur took photographs of their bodies after their deaths.

On Monday, prosecutor Michael Cantlon warned those in the courtroom that disturbing details of the crimes would be discussed. He added that those in attendance should ""think carefully about your need to be here.""

The court began with an analysis of the 2017 death of Andrew Kinsman, the last victim, who was superintendent of McArthur's apartment building. A computer later seized from McArthur contained over 100 photos of Kinsman, including 18 taken after his death in which he is posed, naked, with a rope around his neck and a metal bar attached to the rope.

Parts of the eight men's bodies were found in decorative planters at a home where McArthur was employed as a landscaper. Police arrested him in 2018."

The ""New Girl"" actor serves as executive producer for a show, ""Glamorous"" for which The CW has ordered a pilot, according to Deadline and TVLine.

"" 'Glamorous' centers on a gender non-conforming recent high school graduate who lands the gig of a lifetime interning at a cosmetics company whose products he panned on YouTube,"" reports Deadline.

Wayans Jr.'s new gig comes with controversy, which the star is taking responsibility for, as tweets from years ago have come to light. In screenshots of tweets shared by Out from 2010 and 2016, Wayans Jr. used a derogatory word for transgender people. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, he also crafted tweets with ""no homo"" or ""#NoHomo,"" according to the LGBTQ magazine.

“When I was a young comic trying to find my voice, I made some immature and hurtful tweets that I deeply regret at the expense of the LGBTQ community,” Wayans Jr., 36, said in a statement issued to Deadline and Out. “When I tweeted those comments, almost 10 years ago, I was unaware of the emotional impact they could have.

""I am not excusing that behavior but that is not who I am today. Society evolved and so have I and it is something I will continue to do both personally and professionally,"" his statement continued. ""Continued learning, acceptance and thoughtful words are all important actions that will help make society a kinder and safer place for all people. You know better, you do better.""

""When 'Glamourous' was pitched to us I thought it was brilliant, heartwarming and important,"" he added. ""We will continue to be committed to pursuing protagonists who don’t traditionally get to be at the center of a show and bringing their stories to the screen.”

BIRTHDAY LOVE Hannibal Burress the man who brought down Bill Cosby is 36 today.

Watch his latest joke below: Hannibal Buress talks about getting a ticket for jaywalking in Montreal and wonders at the absurdities of airport security in his special Animal Furnace.

MEH Maroon 5’s Ssuper Bowl Halftime Show 2019 “was okay and not nearly as a bad embarrassment as that awful Game of Thrones advertisement.”

Game of Thrones / Bud Light commercial

Adam Levine and his band Maroon 5rock out on stage during the 2019 Super Bowl Halftime Show . The 39-year-old singer and his bandmates kicked the show off with their classic hits “Harder to Breathe” and “This Love.”

Travis Scott then came out on stage to perform his hit song “Sicko Mode.” He was introduced to the stage with help from Squidward from Spongebob Squarepants and a CGI fireball that flew into the stadium!

M5 then continued things with “Girls Like You” and “She Will Be Loved.” During the latter song, lantern drones in the sky spelled out the words “One Love.”

BACK FROM THE DEAD? Jussie Smollett played his first concert since alleged attack.

Jussie Smollett was blunt, emotional and defiantly determined on Saturday night at a southern California concert some urged him not to play. The actor and singer told the crowd before singing a note that he had to go on with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win said The Guardian.

“And above all, I fought the fuck back,” he said to cheers. Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh: “I’m the gay Tupac.”

“The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the Empire actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

IT’S NOT ABOUT RELIGION Faith should be no barrier to schools teaching respect for LGBT rights. “Recently we’ve seen several clashes between local communities and education leaders over the application of the Equality Act in Britain’s schools. Shraga Stern, the Orthodox Jewish activist, warned earlier this year that Haredi Jews would ‘leave the UK’ if faiths schools were forced to teach children about same-sex relationships and gender reassignment. And last month, the headteacher of a school in Birmingham was petitioned by mainly Muslim parents to do away with a pilot programme called No Outsiders, which is centered around inclusion and diversity as part of sex and relationship education. Although the program addresses issues as broad as gender, race, ageism, faith and disability, the spotlight has, inevitably, fallen on the teaching of LGBT identities according to The Guardian.

Children will naturally have questions … but it is dangerous to assume they will all be able to ask their parents

SEX ED Why are we so coy about sex education for gay teens? Sex education for teens is one of those topics we tend to dance around. No one wants to talk to them about sex. It sounds pervy to tell kids how to have sex – as if you’re ruining their innocence or, worse, grooming them. I don’t know what your sex education was like, but I remember mine: it was putting condoms on bananas says The Guardian.

BAD BLOOD Natalia Taylor at The Yale Daily News is furious that there’s still a blood ban on gay men. “As an active member of the American Red Cross at Yale (ARCY) here on campus, I volunteer regularly at blood drives. Being a part of this community and knowing that I am helping save lives has been an incredible experience. But recently, something happened that made me reconsider my membership in the organization. When I ask other students to donate blood, I’m not surprised when they respond with resistance. I typically get “I’m afraid of needles”, or “I’m too busy”, but one day I got something I wasn’t prepared for — “They don’t want me to donate because I’m gay.”

I am pansexual, and have always advocated for LGBTQ+ rights, so I was outraged when I first learned about the donation ban on gay men. I brought it up at one of the ARCY meetings, frustrated and angry, and my peers were very receptive. ARCY has historically swept this issue under the rug; we don’t make the rules, so it isn’t our problem. But this year we decided to address the argument and do some research before jumping to conclusions. Now I would like to tell you, the broader Yale community, what we discovered.”

SOAP DIGESTKristoff St. John of Young & The Restless has died at 52.

A COLD RUSSIAN WINTER NIGHT Russian based Medusa Project has published a riveting story of a murder in a small remote village in RussiaOn January 10, neighbors reluctantly checked in on 70-year-old Vladimir Dubentsov and 64-year-old Nikolai Galdin and discovered their bodies. People in Ilsky repeatedly asked Novaya Gazeta correspondent Elena Kostyuchenko not to name them in her story — not because they were ashamed of how these two men were harassed or even murdered, but because they were embarrassed that a gay couple lived in their town at all.

Many in Ilsky don’t conceal their hatred of Dubentsov and Galdin, and complained to Kostyuchenko that the couple was openly gay. Starting roughly five years ago, the two men started feuding with neighbors, and local youths began tormenting and abusing them. The trouble apparently intensified when Dubentsov started lobbying the local government for priority housing that many in the community felt he didn’t deserve. He regularly called local officials, demanding the assistance and entitlements he was owed as the son of a World War II veteran (his mother served in the USSR’s brief naval war against Japan).

Dubentsov reportedly had a tense relationship with the local Cossacks, as well, who allegedly refused to let him join their May 9 Victory Day March as the son of a veteran, claiming that his homosexuality made him “less than a man.” The group’s leader, Ataman Viktor Pikalov, denies these rumors. Pikalov says he met Dubentsov twice: once to help him when his home flooded, and a second time when he asked for help being buried beside his mother. The Cossack elder even took Kostyuchenko to a former factory dormitory where some of the town’s gay men apparently live, in order to demonstrate his supposed benevolence toward the LGBTQ community.

While Kostyuchenko was in Ilsky, detectives told her that homophobia was the most likely motive for the double homicide. Police working the case had interviewed all the known gay men in town, and the senior investigator joked to Kostyuchenko that the murders might have been a crime of passion committed by a jealous lover. The victims had just received their pensions, but the killer left the money and everything else in the house. In connection with the case, police interrogated the neighbor’s son, Alexander Panteleenko — a 53-year-old unmarried, childless, nearly blind man, whose detention mortified his mother. When he was released after three days, Panteleenko’s biggest concern was that the town would think he is gay, like Dubentsov and Galdin.

Ralph Northam for the abhorrent photo that appeared on his page in his medical school yearbook: If bigotry is repugnant, why not demand the resignation of Vice President Mike Pence for his ugly views on homosexuality? And while they're at it, why not insist that Pence's wife resign her position at a school that discriminates against gays and lesbians?

I can guess their answer: Pence and his wife are deeply religious, and their views on homosexuality are based on their religious convictions. To this, I say, so what? The Bible was used to justify slavery, and in my own time, racists cited this or that biblical passage to assert that racial segregation was precisely what God intended -- the so-called ""curse of Ham"" or the ""mark of Cain,"" both used to add biblical authority to the rantings of bigots. Now the mark or the curse is on the Pences, who share views that in our nation's history have caused much suffering, including violence.

The other thing Republicans would be sure to say is that racism is different than ""mere"" anti-gay bias. Yes, indeed. Richmond was the capital of the Confederacy. Virginia is the state that once led the nation in number of slaves. The inhumanity of slavery is hard to fathom. It's harder still to comprehend that great men -- Washington, Jefferson, Madison ... you know the names -- not only condoned it, but benefited from it.

Later came slavery's progeny -- the Jim Crow era. I am talking of everything from the absurdity of segregated state parks to the barbarity of lynchings. In Atlanta in 1899, a black man was mutilated and then burned with portions of the body distributed to the crowd. The man's name was Sam Hose. He was probably innocent of murder but not, of course, of being black.

The destructive power of blackface and KKK robes in that yearbook picture cannot be underestimated. But let's ponder, too, the harm of hateful homophobia. It has taken countless lives over the years, caused huge suffering and, like racism, persists to this day.

Homophobia is a staple of the racist right -- Nazis, white nationalists and other adherents of mindless goonery -- and results in the murder of gay and transgender people. In 2017, 20 gay, bisexual and queer men were murdered in hate crimes, an increase of 400 percent from 2016. This problem is hardly going away. And, infamously, in 1998, Matthew Shepard, was beaten, tortured and left to die on account of being gay. Last year, his ashes were interred in the Washington National Cathedral in a ceremony presided over by a gay Episcopal bishop, with music provided by Washington's Gay Men's Chorus.

And when racial hatred and homophobia are combined, the results can be particularly disturbing. Last week, singer and actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two men who allegedly yelled anti-gay and anti-black epithets.

Pence has been long been criticized as hostile to LGBTQ issues. He has linked same-sex couples to a ""societal collapse"" and even once seemed to support conversion therapy, which is a form of torture. A vice president who has expressed such intolerance is a dangerous model.

In certain corners of the right-wing media, criticism of Karen Pence for recently taking a job at the Immanuel Christian School in Springfield, Virginia, was denounced as nothing less than religious bigotry. After all, the argument went, the school was a (BEG ITAL)Christian(END ITAL) school, ultra-conservative and ultra-traditional, which was entitled to teach according to its deeply held beliefs. No doubt. But while America has traditionally given religion wide berth -- and still does -- lines have been drawn. Utah was not admitted as a state until the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints renounced polygamy.

No one is advocating a law requiring Immanuel Christian to practice tolerance, both in its pedagogy and its hiring practices. But the First Amendment that guarantees the school's rights also gives us the right to criticize. It is simply wrong to foster a belief that homosexuality and same-sex marriage are immoral.

I have been torn about Northam -- about whether a single yearbook photo negates a lifetime of tolerance. But I am not torn about Mike and Karen Pence. They are figures of consequence and their bigotry -- regardless of their religious justification -- has to be confronted.

AMPED will now handle Secretly’s physical distribution covering thousands of new releases. Releases include Sharon Van Etten, Bon Iver, Sufjan Stevens, Angel Olsen, Tycho, Wild Nothing, Helado Negro, Mac Demarco, and Mitski, among many other artists.

Speaking about its new distribution partnership, Shelly Westerhausen, Secretly’s Head of North American Physical Sales and Marketing, explained,

“We’ve aligned with a partner that shares Secretly’s deep commitment to the physical marketplace as we continue to expand on so many great opportunities for our labels and artists.”

Dean Tabaac, Head of AMPED Distribution, added,

“AMPED’s ability to connect Secretly’s impressive roster of par excellence artists with fans wherever they shop is the core of who we are and we are elated that Secretly feels the same way.”

Warner/ADA previously handled Secretly’s physical distribution to Amazon and US big-box store accounts.

It remains unclear why Secretly Distribution walked away from the now-expired deal instead of renewing it."

Performing: Smollett told the crowd 'I couldn't let these motherf**kers win' tho thunderous applause

'My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you.

'The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.'

He added that while he was 'frustrated' with 'certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations' about the case, he believes 'justice will be served.'

Honesty: Smollett told the crowd that he hasn't fully healed yet but that he's on his way

Tragic: On Tuesday, Jussie reported that he was attacked in Chicago as he walked home from a Subway restaurant

' 'I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.

'Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.

Jussie Smollett, pictured in the hospital hours after the attack on Tuesday, has returned to the stage in Los Angeles

'As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily.

'I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.

'We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.'

'Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.

'With Love, respect & honor…Jussie,' he said.

It is the first time he has spoken since being targeted in downtown Chicago by two men who he said shouted 'this is MAGA country!' and attacked him as he walked home.

A week before the attack, Smollett reportedly received a homophobic and racist death threat in the mail.

'Photos (pictured) of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,' police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Wednesday evening

It was sent to the studio where he films Empire and is said to have terrified staff.

The letter was dated from January 18, and stated 'You will die black f*g' in cut out letters.

Cops said the mail threat was laced with powder substance that turned out t but crushed Tylenol.

Police are working to find two men they believe may be responsible and are appealing to the public for information.

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, that appears to be dated from January 18, stating that 'You will die black f*g'. Fox Studio received the letter on the 22nd and cops said it was laced with powder Tylenol

The attack has enraged the country and even caught the attention of the president who deemed it 'horrible' on Thursday.

'That's horrible....there is nothing worse, as far as I am concerned,' Trump said on when asked about the incident.

The term MAGA, which was written on the threatening letter and allegedly yelled by the attackers, is an acronym for President Trump's Make America Great Again slogan and a moniker adopted by his supporters.

Smollett's famous family released a statement abhorring the attack, and countless celebrities, including his Empire co-stars, have also spoken out to support him."

In a 30-second-long Hulu spot released on Super Bowl Sunday, Eugene the egg appeared with cracks fracturing his shell.

“Recently I’ve started to crack,” the egg said. “The pressure of social media is getting to me. If you’re struggling too, talk to someone.”

The egg then directed viewers to Mental Health America’s website.

Since Jan. 18, the egg account has been posting photos showing that cracks in its shell have been increasingly worsening.

The video was also posted on the World Record Egg Instagram account and the caption pointed Instagram users to visit talkingegg.info to find a detailed list of mental health organizations around the world.

The talking egg first gained popularity as a stock photo when it started an Instagram campaign to have a post with more likes than Kylie Jenner’s post of her newborn daughter. Jenner’s post previously held the world record for the most-liked Instagram post with nearly 18 million likes. The World Record Egg’s first post has since amassed more than 52 million likes.

Chris Godfrey, a 29-year-old employee at a London-based advertising agency called The&Partnership, has been revealed to be the owner of the World Record Egg account. He’s also had help from his friends Alissa Khan-Whelan, 26, and C.J. Brown, 29, The New York Times reported.

""World_Record_Egg started as something fun to challenge and question social media from the creators at Egg Gang, but quickly turned into an opportunity to give the world a bit of hope and positivity,"" the creators wrote in a press release emailed to NBC.

The team added that the goal of their first project was ""to raise awareness around social media and its impact on mental health, encouraging people to speak up when they need to.""

Mental Health America took to Instagram to thank the World Record Egg for shedding a light on mental health.

“Not everyone chooses to #fightintheopen for mental health, but you did for the 1 in 5 Americans living with a mental health condition,” the caption read. “Thank you, #EggGang!”

Erin Wallace, Mental Health America’s chief communications officer, said the organization was excited when the team behind A World Record Egg asked if they could list Mental Health America on the Hulu clip.

“The reaction has been great, and we are thrilled that World Record Egg used its big reveal to shine a light on mental health,” Wallace wrote via email. “[World Record Egg] has an incredible following, and we applaud the creator for using the platform for such an important message.”

CNBC and others reported that the Instagram account's more than 10 million followers also made it an appealing investment for marketing companies looking to advertise their products to a global audience.

""Being the first brand to crack out of the egg is worth at least $10 million,"" VaynerMedia's head of direct-to-consumer business Nik Sharma told The Atlantic.

Sharma had predicted that advertisers might be more willing to invest in the egg than in the Super Bowl.

The fact that Hulu is paying the egg's team, as reported by the New York Times, is an example of the financial benefit the egg can bring to its creators.

""We chose to partner with Hulu because they gave us the opportunity to spread our message,"" reads the press release, ""and most importantly, do so on the Egg’s terms."""

Henson is here to remind the actor that hate cannot win. Henson, who plays Smollett’s mother Cookie Lyon on the Fox series, revealed during an appearance on the Today show that she offered Smollett a bit of advice following the racist and homophobic attack he endured last week. The actress reportedly reminded Smollett to stay true to himself, Entertainment Tonight reported.

“I just told him to walk in his truth, just stay the Jussie that everybody loves,” the 48-year-old star told Today hosts Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie on Monday. “And you saw the outpouring of love that he had, so, he has touched a lot of people in his career. So, I just told him, ‘Just walk in your truth baby, no one can take that.'”

Henson continued on to say that she told the actor hate won’t win as long as Jussie shows love.

“Jussie is love, that’s who he is and that’s all he knows,” she said.

Henson later appeared on Live With Kelly and Ryan to talk more about how Smollett is handling the attack. She called the actor “resilient” and said he is mostly overwhelmed by the response to the attack.

The attack on Smollett occurred on January 29 as the actor walked along the streets of Chicago. According to a police report at the time, two unknown men approached the actor yelling racial and homophobic slurs. They proceeded to pour an unknown chemical substance over Smollett’s face and tie a noose around his neck. The men left Smollett with a threatening note. Smollett transported himself to the hospital where he recovered for the remainder of the week.

Smollett released a statement on Friday addressing the attack, according to E! News. This was the first time Smollett spoke out since his hospitalization. The 35-year-old actor assured fans that he is OK and working with authorities to bring justice. Smollett also thanked his friends, fans, and family for the “outpouring of love and support” he has received thus far.

Despite the attack, the actor still appeared at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on Saturday evening for a scheduled musical performance. Smollett further addressed the situation during the concert, saying that he is still healing but he needed to be at the performance because hate cannot win.

Smollett also took a moment to clarify some misconceptions about the attack, according to People.

“I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked. I went to the doctor immediately — I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take it easy, obviously. And, above all, I fought the f*** back,” Smollett said."

This anger, and the memory that triggered it, compelled me to tell my truth about an experience I had in the fall of 2004.

It was a typical early morning. I got up and got ready for work and proceeded to take my dog, Pierre, for a walk before truly starting my day. As I walked my dog down the block, I got a strong feeling I was being followed. Suddenly, I turned around and recognized the man who was following me.

I realized that this man was actually someone I had seen in my neighborhood before, so I was shocked in that moment when, out of no where, he started hurling homophobic names and profanity at me. I ignored him and kept walking, but he only moved faster until he was standing right behind me. What I felt next was the pulsating sting of a punch from behind landing right on my neck.

I immediately went into protection mode and got my dog out of harm’s way. I turned around and we starting fighting. My heart was racing a mile a minute. Everything was happening so quickly. I remember defending myself as he threw swift and hard punches at me. This all began on the sidewalk, but within minutes we were brawling in the street.

As we fought, he kept calling me “fa**ot,” “bitch ass ni**a,” “punk ass,” screaming at the top of his lungs. My adrenaline increased with each hateful word he uttered and at that point, I just lunged at him with every ounce of strength I had left. His response, in turn, was to reach into his back pocket for a knife.

This is the part that’s most difficult for me to talk about. My attacker stabbed me in my stomach, and then fled, leaving me to die in the street. I was disoriented, numb, bleeding and feeling completely violated. I had been attacked, and knifed, while hearing words of vitriol used to describe me. It wasn’t just a mugging, it was a hate crime performed by a person overcome by ignorance and disgust.

I went into survival mode, holding my wound to stop the flow of blood. Despite the group of men who stood at the corner watching the entire scene play out, and who did nothing, my faith in humanity wasn’t completely destroyed that morning. A good samaritan came to my rescue, and called 9-1-1. He took my dog and assured me that Pierre would be in a good place and stayed with me until the police and paramedics arrived.

Becoming a Self Advocate

It was a long ER visit that involved treatment and stitches, but eventually I was cleared to go home. My main concern now was healing physically, mentally and emotionally, but also, getting this S.O.B. who did this to me.

Almost a week after my attack, a detective paid me a visit at home with a black binder that contained over 50 mug shots for me to review in hopes that I could identify the man who attacked me, but his face never appeared. I already knew that this man lived close by, which added to my anxiety, not to mention I was also seeing him in my sleep. As the detective left that day, I just kept thinking, I’m a Black, gay man, who felt neither protected nor served, after that meeting.

Then, two weeks later, on my way home from work, I saw him. I spotted my own attacker very boldly walking down the street in the neighborhood as if he had not one care in the world. As a crime victim, the police gave me a case number and told me to call 9-1-1 if I should ever see him again. I did, and much to my surprise, the police came quickly enough to apprehend him. I had essentially caught the man who attacked me.

Charges were filed by the district attorney and I felt very hopeful about my case. Hate crime legislation was new back then, so there was only a slight possibility that he would be charged and go away for a long time.

I didn’t realize how emotional it would be to go through a trial. I walked down the corridor of the court house and saw my attacker sitting on a bench, waiting to go inside the courtroom. Again, I was amazed at his ease, sitting back and reading a newspaper, not even interested in acknowledging me or what he had done to me. We were the first case to appear before the judge, who asked me to share what happened that morning. I held back the tears, the anger, the disgust and the pain and pushed through to tell this horrific story. The judge listened and then turned his attention to my attacker.

I remember him saying, “Mr. Artis was minding his own business walking his dog and ready to go off to work like he normally does; you, however, were drugging and drinking all night long. You saw Mr. Artis and the drugs gave you the courage to act on whatever insecurities you had at the time. You punched Mr. Artis for no reason, he started protecting himself and his dog, and at some point, he overpowered you. At that point, like a coward, you pulled out a knife and stabbed him.”

I’m grateful to say that my attacker was sentenced to 2 ½ years in prison.

Shining a Light on Hate

I am Jussie Smollett and Jussie Smollett is me. He was living his life about to grab a sandwich at a Subway, not hurting a single soul. He stated that he was attacked by men in MAGA caps, who obviously were planning to use that noose and bleach to hurt, embarrass and break someone they perceived as a threat to their idea of what makes America truly great.

As you read this, know that I’ve never told this story out loud, until now. Maybe because, so many people know me as a strong and positive person, and deep down, I was humiliated that this happened to me. Maybe, I’ve never talked about it because I knew so many others who weren’t as “lucky” as I am to have survived a homophobic attack. One thing is for sure, I draw my strength by constantly recalling Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous quote,“Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that.”

And so. I shine a light on that moment and hope that it inspires others to tell and illuminate their stories.

To my LGBTQ family, I beseech you all to stay strong in who you are, walk in your truth and know that even though we are hated in this world by some, we are a proud people who can and will fight back. If a similar story has happened to you, please know that it is not your fault. First and foremost take care of yourself, seek professional help and support from friends and family who truly love you. And above all, know that you are a beautiful creation of God.

Henson calls Jussie Smollett ""resilient"" following his first public appearance since alleged attack

ABC/Lorenzo Bevilaqua(NEW YORK) — During an appearance Monday on Live with Kelly and Ryan, Taraji P. Henson offered some thoughts for her Empire co-star Jussie Smollett, who was allegedly attacked last week in Chicago, in what police are investigating as a hate crime.

“He’s resilient,” Henson told the hosts. “When your very fiber is love…it’s just who he is. So, he’s very resilient.”

Taraji’s comments come after Smollett made his first public appearance over the weekend since the incident. As previously reported, the actor claimed two men hurled racial and homophobic epithets at him, threw an unknown substance on him and put a rope around his neck.

On Saturday night, Smollett took the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California, after an introduction from his older brother Joel, who called him “a true artist” and “the epitome of love.”

“Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,” Jussie Smollett said, tearing up before beginning his set. “We hope that you all stand with us.”

The performance was initially supposed to include a meet-and-greet for fans who had upgraded their tickets, but due to security concerns, the meet-and-greet was canceled. Fans will receive refunds, according to an email from the vendor, TicketWeb.

“Jussie is so honored to perform for his fans, friends and family on Saturday night. However, please forgive us. For security reasons, we cannot accommodate any meet & greets. Your meet & greet upgrade can either be refunded or donated to the Black AIDS Institute in your name,” said the email provided to ABC News.

As of the weekend, Chicago police tell ABC News there are no further updates on the investigation.

And on Monday Taraji P Henson, who plays his mother Cookie Lyon in the Fox series Empire, shared the words of love and encouragement she gave her 35-year-old co-star when she appeared on The Today Show.

'Life is spiritual warfare and we're seeing it right before our very eyes. You just have to stay close to what you know,' she said.

Speaking out: Taraji P. Henson appeared on the Today Show on Monday to talk up her new film, What Men Want, but first she revealed her words of love to Empire co-star Jussie Smollett who was the subject of a racist attack last week

'Jussie is love, that's who he is. That's all he knows. In this situation, hate won't win. It will not.'

Taraji, 48, added: 'I just told him to walk in his truth. To just stay the Jussie that everybody loves.

'You saw the outpour of love that he has. He's touched a lot of people in his career. I just told him, 'Walk in your truth, baby, no one can take that from you.' '

Jussie was attacked in Chicago late on January 28 by two men who allegedly yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, and poured an unknown substance over him.

Sage advice: The 48-year-old actress told the hosts, 'I just told him to walk in his truth. To just stay the Jussie that everybody loves'

Onscreen mom: She continued, 'You saw the outpour of love that he has. He's touched a lot of people in his career. I just told him, 'Walk in your truth, baby, no one can take that from you.' '

At one point they allegedly put a rope around his neck before running off.

Jussi made his first public appearance since the incident at the Troubadour in Los Angeles and talked about the attack.

Meanwhile, Taraji was on the show to talk up her new movie, What Men Want, inspired by the 2000 Mel Gibson movie, What Women Want.

In the new version, Taraji's character Ali can suddenly hear the inner thoughts of all the men around her.

'It's not what you think,' she laughingly told the hosts. 'Women's misconception is that they're driven by sex and money. I think that's an important part of every human - you wanna be successful and we like to feel good, right?

'I think we handled the guys really well in the film. I don't think anyone attached to this project...certainly we didn't wanna male bash I love the men in my life. I'm a mother, I have a son, we need each other.'

What Men Want is due out on Friday."

A Manhattan dietician was found dead in her apartment Wednesday after posting a heartbreaking suicide note on her personal website.

A coworker became worried when Condell, 27, did not show up for work and saw that she had posted a suicidal message on her website. Police responded to a wellness check at Tara Condell's West 10th Street residence, where they found her hanging in he bedroom with cloth around her neck at 4:30 p.m, the New York Post reported.

One of Condell's coworkers was outside her home when police arrived.

The Suicide Note

Instagram

In her message titled ""I Hate The Word “Bye”, But See You Later Maybe?"" Condell says she has contemplated suicide for years and has ""felt absolutely nothing during what should have been the happiest and darkest times in my life.""

""I have written this note several times in my head for over a decade, and this one finally feels right,"" the San Fransisco native wrote. ""No edits, no overthinking. I have accepted hope is nothing more than delayed disappointment, and I am just plain old-fashioned tired of feeling tired.""

In the note, Condell expressed how she was aware her emotional struggle was ""the ultimate first world problem.""

""I realize I am undeserving of thinking this way because I truly have a great life on paper,"" she continued. ""I’m fortunate to eat meals most only imagine. I often travel freely without restriction. I live alone in the second greatest American city (San Francisco, you’ll always have my heart). However, all these facets seem trivial to me.""

She added that ""no single conversation or situation has led me to make this decision.""

Condell went on to list all of the things she will miss, including New York Times crossword puzzles, real street tacos, and Popeye's.

""I’m also going to miss unexpected hugs,"" she wrote. ""Al Green’s Simply Beautiful. Cherries in July. Tracing a sleeping eyebrow. Smoking cigarettes. The Golden Gate Bridge at sunset. That first sip of iced cold brew in sticky August. Making eye contact with people walking down the street. When songs feel like they’re speaking to your soul. Jeopardy. Saying I love you. Late night junk food binges. Shooting the shit. And especially the no-destination-in-sight long walks.""

Condell asked that there be ""no GoFundMes, no funeral, no tributes, no doing-too-much please."" Instead, she asked people to have a delicious meal in her honor ""and let me go, no exceptions.""

""It’s selfishly time for me to be happy and I know you can get down with that,"" she wrote. ""Please try to remember me as a whole human you shared memories with and not just my final act. This is not your fault. It’s not exactly easy for me either, I’m here for you. I love you. I always have and I always will, I promise.""

She ended her emotional note by addressing her parents.

""I’m coming home, Dad. Make some room up on that cloud and turn the Motown up,"" Condell concluded. ""I’m really sorry mama.""

Her Life

Condell's employer, Top Balance Nutrition, confirmed her death in a statement on Facebook Thursday afternoon.

“Tara was a talented dietitian loved by all of her patients and coworkers. But beyond that, she was a true friend who always extended her kindness to those around her,” Top Balance posted. ""At this time, Tara’s family and co-workers request some privacy to process the tragic news.""

Condell was a registered dietician/nutritionist who specialized in general nutrition, weight management, gastrointestinal disease and geriatric health, according to her bio on Top Balance's website. She bachelor’s degree in dietetics from San Francisco State University and her Master's of Science in Clinical Nutrition from New York University.

She ""realized nutrition was her calling after being the sole caretaker of a critically ill parent and seeing how nutrition interactions in the body play a huge role in health,"" her bio reads.

Condell was featured in two Bravo articles last year when she debunked Kim Kardashian's ""diet lollipop"" and weighed in on Kourtney Kardashian's water tips.

He made his first public appearance since the attack this past Saturday night.

“The most important thing that I can say is to keep it simple and say thank you and I’m okay,” Smollett said to the Troubadour crowd last weekend. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to, and I’m going to stand strong with you all.”

“I had to be here tonight,” he added. “I couldn’t let those motherf*ckers win! I will always stand for love; I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love, and I hope you will all stand with me.”

He also directly addressed the crowd about rumors surrounding the attack.

“There’s been a lot of stuff that’s been said about me that’s absolutely not true,” he said. “I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately… I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all, I fought the f*ck back.”

In addition to this proud moment, Chicago police have now recovered a recording of the attack according to TMZ, and hope to try and identify the attackers based on the footage.

Throughout this terrible ordeal, one thing remains clear: Smollett is a fighter, and racists and homophobes don’t stand a chance against him."

In an emotional interview on ""The Late Show Stephen Colbert"" Thursday night, the ""Juno"" actress told Colbert that it was hard to not be ""fired up,"" given the president and vice president's outlook on LGBTQ issues.

""The Vice President of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana,"" Page said.

Page, who identifies as gay, spoke of her wife of one year.

She suggested Pence's beliefs and rhetoric contribute to the prejudice and violence many LGBTQ individuals face.

""Connect the dots,"" Page said. ""Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street.""

Page cited the reported attack against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who told police he was attacked by two men this week while they called him racist and homophobic slurs.

""This needs to f***ing stop,"" Page concluded as she choked up. She was met with a large applause from the audience.

CNN has reached out to the vice president's office for comment on Page's statements, but has not heard back.

Pence is a conservative Christian, and while Governor of Indiana he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Critics of the law contend it could be used by individuals and businesses to discriminate -- particularly against the community of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals -- on the basis of religion.

His wife, Second Lady Karen Pence, recently came under fire for accepting a job as an art teacher at a private Christian school that bars LGBTQ students and employees.

At the time, Kara Brooks, Pence's communications director, said the attention paid to the school's agreement is ""absurd.""

""Mrs. Pence has returned to the school where she previously taught for 12 years. It's absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a Christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack,"" Brooks said in a statement to CNN. She did not answer when asked by CNN if Pence agreed with the policy."

The tweets in question, which use slurs such as “tranny” and “fag,” resurfaced after the CW network announced Wayans as executive producer of its new show, “Glamorous”, about a gender-nonconforming protagonist.

Out magazine, who first reported the story, said that the tweets (most of which were posted in 2010 and 2011) were deleted after the publication reached out to Wayans’ representatives for comment.

In a statement, the 36-year-old actor-comedian told Out, “When I was a young comic trying to find my voice, I made some immature and hurtful tweets that I deeply regret at the expense of the LGBTQ community.

“When I tweeted those comments, almost 10 years ago, I was unaware of the emotional impact they could have. I am not excusing that behaviour but that is not who I am today. Society evolved and so have I and it is something I will continue to do both personally and professionally.”

He added: “You know better, you do better.”

The news comes just months after Kevin Hart stepped down as Oscar host after his past homophobic tweets resurfaced. Hart, who initially tried to ignore the situation, eventually offered an apology when turning down the role as host.

“I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past. I’m sorry that I hurt people… I am evolving and want to continue to do so,” he wrote.

Hart later told Ellen DeGeneres that he had already apologized for the comments years ago and that’s why he was reluctant at first to address the situation, as he didn’t want to go over the subject again.

Wayans’ new show, “Glamorous”, comes from his production company Two Shakes, and follows a gender-nonconforming high-school graduate who winds up working as an intern for a cosmetics company they once dissed on YouTube.

In his statement, Wayans said, “I am very proud of the work we are doing at Two Shakes entertainment. The company was founded with the mission of working with diverse voices, both in front and behind the camera.

“When ‘Glamorous’ was pitched to us I thought it was brilliant, heartwarming, and important. We will continue to be committed to pursuing protagonists who don’t traditionally get to be at the centre of a show and bringing their stories to the screen.”"

The singer tweeted Sunday night that her favorite part of the Super Bowl were the memes being made about 21 Savage. The rapper was detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier that day and reportedly faces deportation for overstaying his visa. Understandably, many people on Twitter didn't think the situation was something to laugh about.

Rapper Wale tweeted, ""Why is somebody freedom funny…. I don't get the joke."" While Offset appeared to subtweet Lovato, writing, ""ALL THE MEMES AND SHIT AINT FUNNY WHEN SOMEBODY GOING THROUGH SOME PRAYING FOR MY DAWG AINT SHIT FUNNY HIS FANILY DEPENDING ON HIM.""

Following this, Lovato took to Twitter to clarify her tweet, explaining that she was referring to the memes that poked fun at 21 Savage being British, not his deportation. She also called out the people in her comments talking about her drug use—the singer was hospitalized in July following an alleged overdose—in response to her comments. ""If you're gonna come at me for making a joke, try coming at me with something original not involving drugs,"" she wrote. ""Fuck Twitter. This is why I don't tweet anymore.""

After deleting her Twitter, she took to Instagram to explain herself even more, writing, ""Wasn't laughing at anyone getting deported. I know that's not a joke.. not have I EVER laughed at that. The meme I posted/was talking about was of him being writing with a feather pen. Sorry if I offended anyone. But it's no excuse to laugh at someone's addiction let alone their OD.""

“Life is spiritual warfare and we’re seeing it right before our very eyes. You just have to stay close to what you know,” she said. “Jussie is love, that’s who he is. That’s all he knows. In this situation, hate won’t win. It will not.”

Henson said she told Smollett to make sure he doesn’t forget who he is as he heals.

“I just told him to walk in his truth. To just stay the Jussie that everybody loves,” she said. “You saw the outpour of love that he has. He’s touched a lot of people in his career. I just told him, ‘Walk in your truth, baby, no one can take that from you.’ ”

Smollett made his first public appearance since the attack on Saturday, performing at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. He addressed the terrifying incident.

“There are so many words on my heart that I want to say,” the 35-year-old said, visibly emotional. “The most important that I can say, to keep it simple, thank you so much. I’m okay … I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. I’m going to stand strong with y’all.”

He also clarified reports about the apparent hate crime.

“Just because there has been a lot of stuff that has been said about me that is absolutely not true,” he said. “There are just a couple of points that I wanted to make really quick… I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked.

As Out reports, the comedian has a history of such comments, which includes the frequent use of the word “tranny” and the phrase “no homo.” To make matters more complicated, the CW also just ordered a pilot about a gender-nonconforming protagonist—with Wayans on board as an executive producer.

In a statement, Wayans told Out, “When I was a young comic trying to find my voice, I made some immature and hurtful tweets that I deeply regret at the expense of the LGBTQ community. When I tweeted those comments, almost 10 years ago, I was unaware of the emotional impact they could have.”

“I am not excusing that behavior,” Wayans continued, “but that is not who I am today. Society evolved and so have I and it is something I will continue to do both personally and professionally. Continued learning, acceptance and thoughtful words are all important actions that will help make society a kinder and safer place for all people. You know better, you do better.”

Early last December, soon after Hart was announced as this year’s Oscar host, his past homophobic tweets resurfaced. Rather than apologize for the remarks, Hart decided to abdicate the position of M.C.—though he did eventually issue a mea culpa on Twitter: “I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past. I’m sorry that I hurt people . . . I am evolving and want to continue to do so,” he wrote as he stepped down from the Oscars.

Hart later insisted to Ellen DeGeneres that he’d already apologized for the old jokes years ago, drawing support from the Ellen host, who tried to get him reinstated as host. The conversation sparked backlash for DeGeneres, whose decision to advocate for Hart made some wonder if she may actually be as out of touch as her recent comedy special humorously suggested she is. When Jussie Smollett was brutally attacked last week, onlookers pointed out that violence like this is precisely the reason that jokes like Hart’s should not be dismissed out of hand. (Hart had said, among other things, that he would beat his son if he turned out to be gay.)

Wayans has adopted a more contrite approach than Hart did, even if his statement stops short of giving a direct apology. YouTuber and trans-rights activist Kat Blaque also said on Sunday that she had seen Wayans telling transphobic jokes around four or five months ago at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. When reached by email, representative for Wayans said that Damon Wayans Jr. has not performed at The Laugh Factory in over a year, maybe two, and noted that Damon Sr. no longer performs stand-up comedy.

Wayans’s new CW show, Glamorous, comes from his production shingle Two Shakes, and follows a gender-nonconforming high-school graduate whose first post-grad internship winds up being with a cosmetics company they once publicly dissed on YouTube. Wayans concluded his statement by writing, “I am very proud of the work we are doing at Two Shakes entertainment. The company was founded with the mission of working with diverse voices, both in front and behind the camera. When Glamorous was pitched to us I thought it was brilliant, heartwarming and important. We will continue to be committed to pursuing protagonists who don’t traditionally get to be at the center of a show and bringing their stories to the screen.”

A representative for the CW did not immediately respond to V.F.’s request for comment.

The “Empire” actor said Tuesday that he was attacked by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” in what Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime. He identifies as gay and plays a gay character on the series.

Smollett said one of his attackers put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

During his concert Saturday night at West Hollywood’s Troubadour club, Smollett told fans that he wanted to clarify that following the attack, he was bruised but his ribs were neither cracked nor broken. He also said that he went to the doctor immediately, but he wasn’t hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to perform at the concert.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” he said. “But I’m going to (be), and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

Smollett: ‘I can’t let attackers win’

Smollett thanked the more than 300 people gathered at the event and struck a defiant note.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all, I couldn’t let those (expletives) … win,” he said, referring to his attackers. “Above all I fought … (expletive) back.”

He reiterated his calls for love, telling fans they needed to do away with hate because love is the only thing they had.

“I don’t even care to name any names,” he said. “The hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop. But guess what, it stops with the people that believe in love.”

After the encore, an impassioned Smollett told the crowd, now is the time to be “blacker and gayer.”

Smollett praised openly gay TV actor Wilson Cruz of “My So-Called Life” for inspiring him.

Cruz, who was in attendance, said, “I’m unbelievably proud of him. If I was able to inspire him as a young person to be able to be his fullest self, that is a point of pride for me for the rest of my life.”

Sofie Khan, who is Mexican-Pakistani and identifies as bisexual, said she was amazed by Smollett’s performance.

“The emotion, the energy,” she said. “Look at all the people coming out. Black, white, Asian, gay, straight — the whole vibe of the people who were all there in love.”

While this was Smollett’s first public appearance since the attack, this is not the first time he has spoken out. In a statement first published by Essence on Friday, Smollett said his attack wasn’t an isolated incident.

“These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,” he said in the statement.

“During times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know,” he said.

The investigation

Earlier this week, Smollett addressed speculation that he had changed his initial story and was less than forthcoming with authorities.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett’s family issued a statement Thursday supporting the actor and condemning the attack, calling it a “racial and homophobic hate crime.”

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning,” the statement read. “His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

Chicago police have released photos of potential persons of interest in the attack and are asking for the public’s help in identifying who they are.

Investigators said they have video of Smollett entering the hotel after the alleged attack with what appears to be a noose around his neck.

CNN’s Don Lemon spoke to Smollett last week, and the actor told him he was shaken and angry that an attack like this could happen. He told him that he fought back against the attackers.

CNN’s Chris Boyette, Sandra Gonzalez and Ryan Young contributed to this report.

Smollett, who appears in the popular show Empire, still had a knot on his face during the show.

The Jan. 29 attack on Smollett is being investigated as a “possible hate crime,” after two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs while they beat him, put a rope around his neck and doused him with an unknown chemical substance.

In a subsequent interview with authorities, Smollett, who is black and openly gay, said the perps made reference to “MAGA,” President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” catchphrase that was created during the 2016 presidential election.

Following his performance on Saturday, Smollett took time to clarify some misconceptions surrounding the apparent hate crime. “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken,” he said referring to some notes he’d brought on stage. “I went to the doctor immediately. I was not hospitalised.”

Last week, Smollett was attacked by two men downtown who caught his attention after allegedly yelled racial and homophobic words. The attack was stated to include a noose being placed around the star’s neck and having bleach poured on him.

The Chicago police have yet to arrest anyone and have released images of “persons of interest.”

Jussie Smollett gave an emotional speech at a gig on Saturday night just days after he was allegedly assaulted in a racist and homophobic attack.

The actor/ singer opened his concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood by telling the audience he had to play the show because he couldn't let his attackers ""win.""

""The most important thing I can say is just, keep it simple and that I'm okay,"" the visibly upset star shared. ""I'm not fully healed yet but I'm going to and... I'm going to stand strong with y'all.

""I had to be here tonight y'all. I couldn't let those motherf**kers win.""

The long-planned concert was Jussie's first public appearance since he was allegedly assaulted outside his apartment in Chicago on Tuesday. The Empire actor was reportedly beaten and had a noose tied around his neck by masked men.

Police officers are investigating the incident and have released images of two people they want to question.

According to TMZ, there were more security guards at the venue on Saturday night, while a meet and greet event that was due to take place before the show was canceled by organizers ""for security reasons.""

Jussie thanked fans for their support in a statement on Friday and insisted he was helping police with their investigation into the alleged assault.

""My body is strong but my soul is stronger,"" he said. ""More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.

""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served."""

Writing in USA Today, the historians argue that the president must be held accountable if the United States is to remain a democracy in any meaningful sense.

“Accountability is essential to the long-term health of our democracy, more important than even healing the nation’s partisan divisions,” they write. “The United States learned this lesson 45 years ago. In August 1974, President Richard Nixon resigned from office in disgrace as soon as it became clear that the House would vote to impeach him for obstructing justice in the Watergate scandal and, moreover, that the Senate would likely vote to remove him from office.”

The historians then argue that former President Gerald Ford’s decision to give Nixon a full pardon as a way to “heal” the nation severely damaged faith in American institutions by seemingly putting elites above the law.

“The nation has continued to pay for its failure to hold Nixon accountable,” they write. “The divisions that Ford had hoped to paper over with his pardon have only continued to widen. Moreover, the general trend — toward a vague sense of ‘healing’ instead of holding specific wrongdoers accountable — has only continued to erode the public’s faith in government over the ensuing decades.”

They conclude by urging Democrats to right decades of historical wrongs by drawing the line at Trump’s behavior and by doing everything in their power to block him from escaping justice.

“As evidence continues to mount about all that President Trump and his advisers have done to violate the public trust, Democrats won’t have much choice,” they write. “If they want to heal the nation, not just for what’s happened under Trump but also for what’s happened in the decades before, they should make sure that wrongdoing is set right.”

Jussie Smollett may be bruised, but he isn’t broken. The 35-year-old made his first public appearance on Saturday night since his reported attack.

“I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let those motherfuckers win,” he shouted to the exuberant crowd in triumph, per The Hollywood Reporter.

Chicago p olice are currently investigating an attack on Smollett, who was reportedly targeted by two men in ski masks who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him and tied a noose around his neck. The FBI is assisting the city department in the matter, due to a previous threat Smollett received in the mail.

According to CNN, the actor-singer performed at the Troubadour Club in West Hollywood to an audience of over 300 people and clarified some things surrounding the reported homophobic and racist attack against him.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” he confirmed. “But I’m going to [be], and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

Assuring that now’s the time to be “blacker and gayer,” the 35-year-old pointed out that he’ll continue to lead with love despite the “hateful rhetoric” spewing around.

“I don’t even care to name any names,” he noted. “The hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop. But guess what, it stops with the people that believe in love.”

Along with love, Smollett championed his resistance.

“And above all, I fought the fuck back,” he said, per E! Online, which resulted in supportive cheers from the audience. “I’m the gay Tupac.”

WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — “I’m OK.”

That was the first thing Jussie Smollett told the sold-out Troubadour in West Hollywood on Saturday night when he walked onstage. The show was the R&B singer and “Empire” actor’s first public appearance since he reported to Chicago police a vicious attack that authorities are investigating as a possible hate crime.

“I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to,” Smollett said, fighting back tears as he addressed the crowd. “I’m gonna stand strong with y’all. I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let those (attackers) win. I will always stand for love.”

With that, the room burst into cheers, and Smollett took his voice back.

Family, friends and fans in the audience were profoundly moved by Smollett’s resilience in performing just days after the incident, in which two people allegedly approached the 36-year-old actor and musician while yelling racist and homophobic slurs.

Before Smollett took the stage, his siblings surrounded the microphone to give a brief statement, where Joel Smollett Jr. said, “As his big brother, I wanted Jussie to sit this one out … but tonight is an important part of Jussie’s healing. He’s been a fighter since he was a baby … But above all else, he is the epitome of love.”

In the audience, many fans said they felt a personal obligation to be there and stand up for Smollett and the communities — black, gay, artistic — that he represents.

The news of the assault “was gut-wrenching to hear, in this day and age. It was a sobering reminder of hate,” said Carrington Bester of Los Angeles. “It was important to be here to support him. This speaks to his integrity and commitment to his art.”

Jametta Bailey-Hailey, who traveled from Springfield, Mass., for the show, said, “I called my mother and literally cried” after hearing news of the attack. For every step forward in the fight against racism and homophobia, Bailey-Hailey said, “it’s like we’re walking five steps back.”

But, Bailey-Hailey added, Smollett’s grit and commitment to music was a glimmer of hope. “We stand with him, nothing’s going to stop him.”

Smollett looked determined not to let the attack define his performance. He did open with a cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Love’s in Need of Love Today,” as apropos a statement as he could have made. But he danced and sang with genuine joy as he performed songs such as “HaHa (I Love You)” and “Heavy,” a centerpiece of his “Empire” performance that, he admitted, “kinda has a new meaning to me.”

On “Need Freedom,” he drew lyrical connections between what happened to him and a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., as well as the racial tensions that led to numerous protests in Ferguson, Mo., and the police-shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.

But most of the set turned the ballads and club cuts from his “Empire” and solo work, such as “Insecurities” and “Conqueror,” into implicit assertions of his own resilience.

He even cracked a few wry jokes about the experience. After telling his story about trying to fight off his attackers, he grinned and said, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

More earnestly, he said that he owed his self-confidence to the example set by the pioneering gay television actor Wilson Cruz (who was in the crowd on Saturday), and artistic north stars such as Alvin Ailey and James Baldwin.

Just by being onstage at this moment, Smollett was illustrating how he would do more than just survive this incident. He would use this grim reminder of American culture’s violence as a means for his own resistance.

On the Troubadour stage, he told the crowd in sharp language that he “fought the … back” against his assailants. But in the end, he dedicated his set to keeping up optimism and kindness, even when one can face such visceral, physical hate.

“This hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop,” he said. “I’ve been guilty of it too. We who celebrate love can get wrapped up in so much hate. It’s not that we become hateful, but it waters down our love. We can’t let that happen.”"

Last month, both Netflix and Hulu released documentaries exploring the Fyre Festival debacle where droves were stranded on a Bahamian island with lackluster food and meager accommodations in April 2017 at what was billed as the mother of all destination festivals.



The rapper was among its organizers and he receives a lot of flak in both docs for his part in the catastrophe, which was tweeted, live-streamed and photographed by its young attendees. But on Friday, when taking the stage in New Jersey, the rapper decided to clear the air with his fans.

He raised a middle finger to those in attendance and asked whose seen the new documentaries and suggested, ""You might be a little mad at me.""



That’s when he lead the crowd in a chant where everyone cursed him out.



""I want y'all to repeat after me,“ he said, middle finger still in the air. ""Get it out of your f**king system cause we ain't gonna do this s**t for the rest of the year! So get your motherf**king middle fingers up.""



Then he shouted, ""Let me hear you say ‘F**k you, Ja Rule!""

When the docs dropped in January, the rapper had several exchanges on Twitter defending himself.



“I feel bad for those ppl... but I did not and would never scam ANYONE... period!!!” he tweeted. “And I don’t care if anyone sympathizes with me or not those are the FACTS!!!”



Soon after horrifying details of the failed music festival came to light in April of 2017, Ja Rule apologized to would-be festival goers and stressed his innocence in the fall-out.



""We are working right now on getting everyone out of the island SAFE that is my immediate concern,"" he wrote on Instagram, declaring that the event was ""not a scam."" ""I don't know how everything went so left but I'm working to make it right by making sure everyone is refunded.""

“I truly apologize as this NOT MY FAULT… but I’m taking responsibility. I’m deeply sorry to everyone who was inconvenienced by this.”

Ja Rule and his co-founder Billy McFarland were slammed with a $100 million class action lawsuit in 2017, for which the rapper denies liability. MacFarland is currently serving a six-year sentence in federal prison after pleading guilty to two counts of wire fraud and faking documents to secure investors in his company."

Ralph Northam is doing everything to keep his job.

After a 1984 photo from Eastern Virginia Medical School went viral, which contained a photograph of two unidentified men, one in blackface and the other in a Ku Klux Klan costume under a page labeled as his, went viral, the governor apologized. It wasn’t clear which person he was in the photo but now he is saying he wasn’t even in the photo. He also said he has only darkened his skin for a Michael Jackson costume.

According to CNN, Northam said on Saturday, “I believe now and then that I am not either of the people in this photo. This was not me in that picture. That was not Ralph Northam.” He continued, “I intend to continue doing the business of Virginia. I could avoid an honest conversation about harmful actions from my past. I cannot in good conscience choose the path that would be easier for me in an effort to duck my responsibility to reconcile.”

In the bizarre hour-long press conference, he did say he once darkened his skin for a Michael Jackson costume, “I had the shoes, I had a glove, and I used just a little bit of shoe polish to put under my — or on my — cheeks. And the reason I used a very little bit is because, I don’t know if anybody’s ever tried that, but you cannot get shoe polish off…. I look back now and regret that I did not understand the harmful legacy of an action like that.”

On Friday, Northam released a statement, which read, “I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now. This behavior is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career in the military, in medicine, and in public service. But I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians’ faith in that commitment.”

On Feb. 1, Northam even admitted he was in the photo but did not say if he was the person in blackface or dressed as a member of the KKK, according to the New York Times.

The pressure is on for him to resign. If he does, Justin Fairfax, the lieutenant governor, will become governor, which would make him Virginia’s first Black governor since 1989.

The actress appeared on the The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to discuss her new Netflix series, The Umbrella Academy but was presented with the opportunity to speak her truth about the ill treatment of the LGBTQ community, and took it.

When first asked by Colbert if she thinks Hollywood has changed in terms of being more inclusive to the LGBTQ community, Page responded: “There is clear evidence that it has changed, that there is some progress, that there is some more representation.”

She added however that it is not enough, saying: “Honestly, I really think we need to hurry up. It’s not cutting it.”

Page went on to point out the lack of discussion about big issues including “environmental racism” and the hate crime attack on Jussie Smollett.

Clarifying on why she is so angry towards the blatant disregard of these issues, Page said: “It feels impossible to not feel this way right now with the President and Vice President Mike Pence, who like wishes I couldn’t be married.

“Let’s just be clear, the Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the government of Indiana.”

The 31-year-old then urged people to “connect the dots” to make sense of the ill-treatment of marginalised communities.

“If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them…what do you think is going to happen?

“Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street.”

Page concluded, saying: “I have travelled the world and I have met the most marginalised people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.”

He offered a defiant message: Fighting back against the men he says attacked him. ""I'm going to stand strong with y'all,"" he told the audience.

The ""Empire"" star who was the victim of a hate crime made his first public appearance since the attack in Chicago, in a performance at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on Sat. Feb. 2, 2019. ""Entertainment Tonight""

On Tuesday morning he told officers two men beat him, splashed him with a chemical substance and put a noose around his neck, in an attack near his Chicago apartment. He later said they were yelling, ""This is MAGA country"" — a reference to President Trump's campaign slogan.

""I fought the f*** back,"" Smollett said.

Police are investigating last Tuesday's incident in Chicago as a possible hate crime.

Over the weekend, police gathered new surveillance video from the apartment building where Smollett lives, a nearby hotel, and traffic cameras in the area. So far, police say they've spotted two men in the vicinity where the attack was reported, but have not found video of the incident.

The “Empire” actor said Tuesday that he was attacked by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” in what Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime. He identifies as gay and plays a gay character on the series.

Smollett said one of his attackers put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

During his concert Saturday night at West Hollywood’s Troubadour club, Smollett told fans that he wanted to clarify that following the attack, he was bruised but his ribs were neither cracked nor broken. He also said that he went to the doctor immediately, but he wasn’t hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to perform at the concert.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” he said. “But I’m going to (be), and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

Smollett: ‘I can’t let attackers win’

Smollett thanked the more than 300 people gathered at the event and struck a defiant note.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all, I couldn’t let those (expletives) … win,” he said, referring to his attackers. “Above all I fought … (expletive) back.”

He reiterated his calls for love, telling fans they needed to do away with hate because love is the only thing they had.

“I don’t even care to name any names,” he said. “The hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop. But guess what, it stops with the people that believe in love.”

After the encore, an impassioned Smollett told the crowd, now is the time to be “blacker and gayer.”

Smollett praised openly gay TV actor Wilson Cruz of “My So-Called Life” for inspiring him.

Cruz, who was in attendance, said, “I’m unbelievably proud of him. If I was able to inspire him as a young person to be able to be his fullest self, that is a point of pride for me for the rest of my life.”

Sofie Khan, who is Mexican-Pakistani and identifies as bisexual, said she was amazed by Smollett’s performance.

“The emotion, the energy,” she said. “Look at all the people coming out. Black, white, Asian, gay, straight — the whole vibe of the people who were all there in love.”

While this was Smollett’s first public appearance since the attack, this is not the first time he has spoken out. In a statement first published by Essence on Friday, Smollett said his attack wasn’t an isolated incident.

“These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,” he said in the statement.

“During times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know,” he said.

The investigation

Earlier this week, Smollett addressed speculation that he had changed his initial story and was less than forthcoming with authorities.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett’s family issued a statement Thursday supporting the actor and condemning the attack, calling it a “racial and homophobic hate crime.”

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning,” the statement read. “His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

Chicago police have released photos of potential persons of interest in the attack and are asking for the public’s help in identifying who they are.

Investigators said they have video of Smollett entering the hotel after the alleged attack with what appears to be a noose around his neck.

CNN’s Don Lemon spoke to Smollett last week, and the actor told him he was shaken and angry that an attack like this could happen. He told him that he fought back against the attackers."

A senior administration official nonetheless said Trump is planning to strike a “unifying tone” in his address.

Some issues could get bipartisan applause lines, like lowering prescription drug prices, infrastructure and pressuring China on its trade policies.

“Together we can break decades of political stalemate, we can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future. The decision is ours to make,” Trump will say, according the official.

If all the 2020 challengers aren’t enough, Pelosi will be sitting just above Trump’s left shoulder, literally breathing down his neck as her committee chairs (sitting in the audience) prepare to launch a slew of investigations into his administration — and several individual Cabinet members who will accompany Trump down the center aisle.

The two political heavyweights — Trump and Pelosi — have clashed for the past two months over the president’s demand that the Congress approve $5.7 billion for his wall on the southern border. The knock-down, drag-out fight shut down the government for a record 35 days — furloughing 800,000 federal workers, sparking delays at airports and delaying Republicans’ and Democrats’ annual policy retreats.

The State of the Union speech itself became a hostage in the Trump-Pelosi firefight. Pelosi invited and then disinvited Trump to deliver his annual address amid the shutdown. Trump threatened to come to Capitol Hill anyway on Jan. 29, launching an unprecedented standoff between the executive and legislative branches.

When Trump reopened the government with no new wall funding, caving to Pelosi’s position, the Speaker extended an olive branch, and a second invitation, to Trump for Tuesday.

But the truce seemed to be over as soon as it began, with funding for a handful of federal agencies set to run out again after Feb. 15. Trump has continued to insist Congress deliver him money for his wall; Pelosi has continued to rebuff him.

The real, functional deadline for lawmakers will be on Friday, just three days after Trump appears in the House chamber. Lawmakers on the bipartisan, bicameral conference committee are aiming to complete a deal by the end of this week to give both chambers enough time the following week to send a bill to Trump by the Feb. 15 deadline.

Trump, however, has dismissed the bipartisan committee of negotiators as a “waste of time.”

The president told reporters at the White House on Friday that there is a “good chance” he will declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress and build a wall along the border with Mexico.

“I think there’s a good chance we’ll have to do that,” Trump said.

Trump said people should “listen closely” to his Tuesday address and indicated he'll offer more details about his plan.

Pelosi scoffed at Trump’s dismissal of the conference committee.

“I mean, really, a president who wants to have Congress be completely irrelevant in how we meet the needs of the American people? No, come on,” Pelosi said Thursday.

Pelosi will sit behind him, but Trump will literally have to face the new House Democratic majority resisting his agenda as he speaks.

Trump, however, vanquished them all. In fact, during the 2016 campaign, Trump mocked Rubio’s now-infamous State of the Union GOP response where the senator — suffering from a dry mouth — took an awkward sip of water as the cameras rolled.

Those one-time 2016 GOP presidential rivals have now aligned themselves with Trump. And they likely will be applauding many of his lines on Tuesday.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The rights of crime victims would be enshrined in the Pennsylvania Constitution under a proposed amendment that could go before the state’s voters later this year, but opponents warn the change has the potential to end up violating the rights of criminal defendants. The amendment, promoted by a national effort known as Marsy’s Law, and named for a 1983 California murder victim , would enumerate rights for victims that include being notified about all hearings and being allowed to attend them, and the ability to weigh in during plea hearings, sentencings and parole proceedings.

It would also guarantee “a prompt and final conclusion” of the case and post-conviction proceedings and the right to full restitution. The amendment passed both legislative chambers unanimously last year. If an identical version passes the House and Senate again before the end of 2020, it will then be up to voters to decide, through a statewide referendum, whether to add it to the constitution. Supporters held a Capitol rally last week to push for its approval, and Republican leaders who have majorities in both chambers have indicated the proposal has wide support and they intend to move it through quickly.

SUNBURY, Pa. (AP) — A pregnant Pennsylvania teacher who alleges that she was fired from her Catholic school job because the diocese was upset that she wasn’t married has filed suit contesting her termination.

Naiad Reich filed a breach of contract suit Friday in Northumberland County against the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg.

She’s also seeking a permanent injunction that would reinstate her as a teacher at Our Lady of Lourdes Regional School in Coal Township, outside Shamokin. Reich, who isn’t Catholic, said she was fired Nov. 30 after notifying the diocese that she and her boyfriend were expecting a baby in June but had no immediate plans to marry. The pregnancy was also planned. The diocese, which earlier said it doesn’t comment on personnel matters, said officials hadn’t seen the suit and couldn’t comment before reviewing the documents.

OSHAWAY (AP) – The Canadian subsidiary of General Motors was unable to stop an auto workers union from airing a critical TV commercial during the Super Bowl. The 30-second ad calling the automaker greedy and “un-Canadian” broadcast on Canadian TV stations during Sunday’s game. GM announced plans in November to close its car factory in Oshawa, Ontario, near Toronto, costing the jobs of about 2,600 blue-collar workers.

The commercial accuses GM of continuing to expand in Mexico while leaving Canadians “out in the cold” and makes claims about the costs of a 2009 auto bailout. GM of Canada sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Unifor union giving it a Saturday deadline to stop using the ad, but the demand wasn’t heeded. GM says in a statement that the ad is misleading and inaccurate.

BERLIN (AP) — Voters in a municipality in northwestern Germany have delivered a clear message: no street names, thanks. Official results from a referendum held on Sunday showed 60 percent of voters in Hilgermissen rejected the local council’s plan to name the streets, while 40 percent supported the proposal. The proposed change was intended to make it easier for people — including police, emergency and delivery services — to find their way around the municipality of some 2,200 residents.

Hilgermissen was formed in the 1970s out of several villages. Addresses currently consist of a house number and the name of a former village, a system that has become more unwieldy as new buildings are added.

Three locals organized the referendum to oppose street names. Sunday’s result is binding for two years.

NEW YORK (AP) — Sprinkled into a game that provided little scoring, the most-remembered ads at this year’s Super Bowl focused on humor. Amazon led the way with ads featuring celebrities trying out rejected products featuring Alexa, its voice-activated aide. Harrison Ford was victimized by his dog’s collar, which his pooch used to order a truckload of pet products over his wishes. Forest Whitaker was flummoxed by his Alexa-enabled electric toothbrush.

Bud Light did the commercial equivalent of a flea-flicker — starting an ad as a jousting tournament and morphing it into a promo for the next season of “Game of Thrones.” Among the most touching ads were those for Google Translate and Microsoft. Google’s ad pointed out that while words can hurt and divide, the ones that are the most translated in the world are “How are you,” ”Thank You” and “I love you.” The Microsoft ad tugged on heartstrings by featuring kids using an Xbox controller designed for players who have mobility issues.

WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Jussie Smollett says his friends and family urged him to cancel his concert in West Hollywood over the weekend. But he says he couldn’t because his attackers might think they’d won. The “Empire” actor and singer performed at the Troubadour on Saturday night, five days after being beaten in Chicago by two masked men who uttered racist and anti-gay comments.

Smollett, who’s black and openly gay, told his audience the most important thing he could say was “thank you so much” and that he’s OK. Smollett says while he isn’t “fully healed yet” — he vows he is “going to be.” Meanwhile, police in continue their investigation into the beating. Chicago police say Smollett has cooperated with authorities — shooting down online chatter that he has been less-than-forthcoming.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Super Bowl was one of the most low-scoring ones we’ve had in a while. And as if to follow suit, the box office race during Super Bowl weekend was equally lackluster. For the third straight week, “Glass” is number one while “The Upside” holds second. Moviegoers for the most part stayed away from the multiplexes. It’s expected when the final numbers come in, this will be the slowest Super Bowl weekend at the movies in nearly two decades.

SEATTLE (AP) — A pregnant Washington state woman remains hospitalized but her condition has improved after her 4-year-old son shot her in the face with a loaded handgun he found under a mattress. King County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Sgt. Ryan Abbott says the 27-year-old mother was hospitalized Saturday with life-threatening injuries. He says her condition improved yesterday and she was transferred to another hospital.

Abbott says the woman and her boyfriend, who is the father of her son, were in bed watching television when the boy found the unsecured gun between the mattress and box spring. Abbott says the boy unintentionally shot her his mother in the face. She’s eight months pregnant. The woman’s boyfriend told deputies he borrowed the gun for protection. The shooting is under investigation.

“The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK,’ ” said the “Empire” actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn’t do that.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those [expletives] win,” he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

His small band then launched into an upbeat song, and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hourlong set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

“And above all, I fought the [expletive] back,” he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she’s glad he did.

“It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,” Davis said. “He showed everyone in the room he was strong.”

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting a rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, although they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident Friday in a written statement that said he had been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he’s not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in “Empire,” the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, “Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night’s set, along with songs from “Empire.”

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

“To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,” Joel Smollett Jr. said. “But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie’s healing. He’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.”"

The Empire star’s family members, friends, and fans took to social media to offer words of comfort. Even celebrities close to Jussie shared their reactions to the disheartening encounter. Since the attack occurred, Jussie has been relatively silent, but on Saturday, February 2, he finally decided to speak out about the incident.

According to Bossip, Jussie Smollett decided to take the stage at Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. Initially, there were security concerns about the performance and multiple reports suggested Jussie would not perform. However, he found the strength to do so. He made it clear that it was important to him to make the first public appearance since the attack because he refused to let the enemy win.

During his performance, he spoke about the attack. Jussie also thanked fans for their ongoing support. “The most important thing that I can say is to keep it simple and say thank you and I’m okay,” Jussie confirmed.

“I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to and I’m going to stand strong with you all. I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let those motherf***ers win.”

Jussie Smollett continued with more details about the injuries he suffered. In an attempt to clear up some of the rumors, Jussie stated that his ribs were bruised and not cracked as previous reports suggested. He also went on to share an interesting comparison. The singer/actor revealed he fought back during the attack and described himself as the “gay Tupac.”

The reference has caught the attention of fans everywhere. Many have taken to social media to share their reactions to Jussie’s words. While some have criticized him for the comparison, other fans admitted they understand his perspective.

The latest news follows a string of reports about Jussie Smollett. The Chicago Police Department has released a few details about the attack. Initially, reports only centered on Jussie’s statements but now there is reportedly surveillance footage that shows the two masked suspects. When they approached Jussie, they reportedly spewed derogatory slurs before attacking him, putting a noose-like rope around his neck and pouring bleach on him. Now, investigators are working to piece together the rest of the details to locate the suspects.

A couple of days after the attack, Jussie broke his silence with a positive statement. He said, “So, I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope you will all stand with me.”

An investigation into the incident is currently underway. However, the Chicago Police Department has yet to identify the suspects involved."

He also added that the president does not use a tanning bed to achieve his infamous skin tone. An aide added that Trump does use a translucent powder for his skin before television appearances.

Omarosa wrote in her 2018 memoir “Unhinged” about President Trump’s orange skin and said he uses a tanning bed every day and that an employee was fired for mishandling the machine.

According to police, Smollett was accosted last Tuesday in Chicago by two masked men shouting homophobic and racial slurs. He was then beaten and doused in what was likely bleach. The alleged assailants reportedly also wrapped a rope around his neck.

In a subsequent interview with authorities, Smollett, who is black and gay, said the perps yelled “MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” catchphrase.

Smollett, best known for playing Jamal Lyon on FOX's hit drama Empire, told police he was attacked by two men outside of a fast food restaurant in Chicago, Illinois on Tuesday. The alleged assailant shouted racist and homophobic slurs at Smollett, beat him, wrapped a rope around his neck and even doused him with an unknown chemical, believed to be bleach. In a show of strength and resilience, Smollett showed up for a live performance in West Hollywood on Saturday, addressing the attack with the crowd.

Smollett clarified some details about the attack. According to a report by CNN, he told the audience that he was badly bruised, but his ribs were neither cracked or broken. He added that he was not technically hospitalized, he just went straight to the doctor after his attackers fled. He assured fans he was fully cleared for that night's performance.

""I'm not fully healed yet,"" he said. ""But I'm going to [be], and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all.""

Smollett did not diminish the racist and homophobic implications of the attack, nor did he disagree with the Chicago Police Department and the FBI investigating it as a hate crime. However, Smollett's main message was to focus as much energy as possible on love in order to move forward.

""I don't even care to name any names,"" he said. ""The hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop. But guess what, it stops with the people that believe in love.""

Later, Smollett told the crowd that now is the time to be ""blacker and gayer"" in the face of hate-fueled attacks. He praised other performers for helping to strengthen his resolve, particularly My So-Called Life star Wilson Cruz, who was at the show.

""I'm unbelievably proud of him. If I was able to inspire him as a young person to be able to be his fullest self, that is a point of pride for me for the rest of my life,"" Cruz told reporters.

Smollett has emphasized the importance of LGBTQ representation in his own personal journey before. In 2015, he first came out publicly on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he praised the comedian as an icon he looked up to when he was young.

""It was very, very important to me that, as my first performance and talk show that it was with you."" he said at the time. ""You’ve been such an inspiration to so many, but also to me. What you’ve done with, in the LGBT community is very much in my opinion kind of like what Michael Jackson did with the black community just that you are who you are.""

The investigation into the attack on Smollett is ongoing."

Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood star Milan Christopher has spoken out about the Jussie Smollett attack — and he doesn’t seem to be siding with the Empire star.

Instead, Milan, who is from Chicago, has enraged quite a few Jussie Smollett fans with suggestions Jussie may have been lying about the attack.

Empire star Jussie told police he had just arrived at his apartment in Chicago on Tuesday, January 29, as he prepared to begin filming for the FOX series but that around 2am he was feeling hungry so walked down to a nearby Subway restaurant to get something to eat.

That is when Jussie says he was met by two attackers reportedly wearing ski masks. They are accused of pouring an unknown substance on the singer-actor and placing a noose around his neck while yelling, “This is MAGA country” before Smollett was able to get away.

In the days since Jussie Smollett was attacked, many actors and musicians have rallied around him in support. However, Milan Christopher posted a message claiming he believes parts of the story just don’t make sense.

Initially, Milan put up a post on Instagram in support of Jussie before pulling that and taking to his comments to talk about why he thinks things don’t add up — as caught in this screenshot.

Milan Christopher also took to Twitter, posting about society believing “what they want to believe”.

Today I realize we live in a society that truly “believes what it wants to believe” without merit, evidence or facts. Their is no wonder why religious propaganda, Political agenda & cultural deception is so readily & easily accepted & regurgitated. — Milan Christopher (@MilanChrisGordy) January 30, 2019

In our culture No matter how outlandish or idiotic the thought maybe anyone who doesn’t follow trends, practices or common beliefs are ostracized. It’s really kinda insane! 😒 — Milan Christopher (@MilanChrisGordy) January 30, 2019

The next day, Milan Christopher posted another message about people reading a “clickbait” headline and spreading it around.

In the comments, one person called him out, writing, “This isn’t about you Milan. Let’s lift our brother up. We don’t know what he’s going through. Whether it makes sense to you or not, it’s none of your business to pass around premature opinions. Let’s pray for him, encourage him, and let him know we support him! Positive Energy!”

Days after his initial remarks about the Jussie Smollett attack he posted another message about how he was “still skeptical”.

Now back to my original thought I SAID WHAT THE FUCK I SAID & 2days later still feel the same exact way. STILL SKEPTICAL & i stand by it. i stand in my truth, i fight for injustices when need be but i'm also able to recognized what could be ORCHESTRATED PLOTS OF PROPAGANDA. — Milan Christopher (@MilanChrisGordy) January 31, 2019

Others responded with another call to support Jussie.

“Milan he has not made a public statement. There is no reason to doubt him,” read one response to Milan’s tweet. “We can doubt the reports We should be standing within him until theres reason from him not to. Even having doubt out there is terrible. We, I stood by you when u were in an altercation no questions asked.”

It’s not clear why Milan Christopher changed his views on supporting Jussie Smollett. The investigations into the case continue."

The additions will bring the total number of active-duty troops on the border to 4,350.

The announcement is in line with what Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan had said last Tuesday when he provided estimates for the next phase of a military mission that has grown in size and length. Critics have derided it as a political ploy by the White House as President Trump seeks billions to build a border wall.

Shanahan said Tuesday that several thousand more troops would be sent mainly to install additional wire barriers and provide a large new system of mobile surveillance and monitoring of the border area. Sunday’s announcement said the mobile surveillance mission would last through Sept. 30.

Members of Congress have questioned whether the border mission is distracting troops from their main work of fighting extremists abroad and training for combat. The first active-duty troops were sent to the border on about Oct. 30 for a mission that was to end Dec. 15. It has since been extended twice.

“What impact does it have to readiness to send several thousand troops down to the Southern border? It interrupts their training. It interrupts their dwell time,” Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee said at a hearing Tuesday.

Vice Adm. Mike Gilday, director of operations for the Joint Staff, told the panel that he does not believe military readiness has been significantly affected. He said some units have missed training opportunities because of the deployment and others have seen less time at home between deployments than the military likes to provide.

But he said there is an effort to rotate service members in and out of the mission every six to eight weeks in order to minimize any impact.

“The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the “Empire” actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn’t do that.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,” he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

“And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,” he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she’s glad he did.

“It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,” Davis said. “He showed everyone in the room he was strong.”

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he’s not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in “Empire,” the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, “Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night’s set, along with songs from “Empire.”

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

“To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,” Joel Smollett Jr. said. “But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie’s healing. He’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.”

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has reported being assaulted in Chicago on Tuesday by two men hurling racial and homophobic slurs at him and wrapping a rope around his neck in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, officials said.

Smollett, 36, had just landed in town from New York and was out getting a bite to eat at about 2 a.m. CT (3 a.m. ET) on East North Lower Water Street, in the upscale neighborhood of Streeterville, is when two men attacked him, the actor told police.

Two ""unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" according to a statement from the Chicago Police Department. ""The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.""

The chemical is believed to be bleach, according to a source familiar with the investigation.

""At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck,"" the statement continued. ""The offenders fled the scene.""

In a recording obtained by emergency-services feed aggregator Broadcastify, a dispatcher repeated information she gleaned from Smollett's friend who called in the attack.

""He's supposed to be well-known, requesting a report and said a noose was placed over the friend's neck,"" the dispatcher relayed to first responders.

Smollett, who is black and gay, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment. The extent of his injuries was not immediately known.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. ""Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating.""

Late Tuesday Guglielmi said on Twitter that investigators have canvassed an expanded area and were continuing to search for video evidence. ""Thus far, no video of the alleged assailants or a vehicle has been discovered but we are continuing to broaden our search,"" he said.

In a subsequent statement he added that police have already reviewed a lot of video but that they are continuing to search for imagery that would help them identify suspects.

""The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras,"" Guglielmi said. ""As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders. Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect's vehicle to be able to share.""

Twentieth Century Fox Television issued a statement in support of the actor.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,"" according to a company statement.

""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Friends and co-workers of Smollett's in addition to gay-rights advocates also spoke out.

I'm just now hearing the news about the senseless hate attack on my #EMPiRE Nephew @JussieSmollett IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!! SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE! PRAYERS UP TO U NEPHEW! 😢😢🙇🏾‍♀️🙇🏾‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/p4GqfNW3An — Vivica A. Fox (@MsVivicaFox) January 29, 2019

""DEAR GOD! Prayers and justice for Jussie Smollett,"" tweeted actress Kerry Washington.

Actor, writer and ""Empire"" producer Danny Strong said in a tweet addressed to Smollett's attackers, ""do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.""

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation said in a statement: ""GLAAD reached out to FOX and Jussie’s team today to offer assistance as well as support for him. Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.""

NAACP President Derrick Johnson said that hate crimes are on the rise.

""The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling,"" he said in a statement,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""We pray for a full physical and mental recovery Jussie Smollett and many unnamed victims of this forum of hate based terrorism.”

On ""Empire,"" Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, the estranged son of his music-industry titan father played by Terrence Howard. Jamal is a gay singer-songwriter and his sexual orientation and career independence has him at odds with the family patriarch.

Smollett came out as gay in a backstage interview with Ellen DeGeneres in 2015, after ""Empire"" first aired on Fox.

Smollett appeared on MSNBC's ""PoliticsNation With Al Sharpton"" on Sunday to discuss the future of historically black colleges and universities. The actor has been active in fundraising efforts to save Bennett College in Greensboro, North Carolina."

Ellen Page is not screwing around.

During a recent appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the actress expressed concern over climate change, the Trump Administration's implicit encouragement of hate crimes, and the media's incompetence in handling these sensitive issues.

Page's guest spot on the show was meant to promote her latest project, Netflix series The Umbrella Academy, which is a television adaptation of the comic book series created Gerard Way and Gabriel Bá. Instead, she used her air time to speak her mind.

During a discussion about her environmental activism, the actress explained why we need to talk about climate change and global warming more seriously, and how it's an issue that disproportionately impacts people of color.

""I just want to say people, particularly the most marginalized people, particularly people in the world that had nothing to do with this are the ones that are suffering the most currently,"" Page said. ""We have been told that by 2030, the world as we know it, that's it... The urgency would be so severe and instead, we have a media that's barely talking about it.""

Later, she segued the conversation toward the recent hate crime on Empire star Jussie Smollett. She held nothing back as she criticized the media's hesitance to label it a racist, homophobic attack.

""We have a media that’s saying it’s a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd!"" Page exclaimed. ""This shit isn’t a debate.""

The Juno star tied the incident to the Trump administration, particularly Vice President Mike Pence's stance on gay marriage. A vocal adversary of the LGBTQ community, Pence supports banning gay marriage, gay conversion therapy, and the military's ban on openly gay soldiers.

""It feels impossible not to feel this way now with the President and the Vice President who like wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear."" Page continued. ""The Vice President of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.""

Page pleaded with viewers to ""connect the dots"" between the hate crime against Smollett and the anti-LGBTQ policies of people in power.

""If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen?"" Page said, visibly holding back tears. ""Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you can meet. I am lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.""

CBS

The actress has always used her platform to highlight marginalized groups, especially the LGBTQ community. In her Emmy-nominated documentary series, Gaycation, she traveled to countries like Japan, Brazil, and Jamaica to explore different queer cultures and hear their stories.
