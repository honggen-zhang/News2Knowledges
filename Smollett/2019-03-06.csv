Christian Cooper recorded a white woman in Central Park Monday morning threatening to call police on him “because he wasn’t going to be intimidated,” NBC News reports.

Christian is Black. The woman he recorded, Amy Cooper is white.

In his video that has gone viral on social media she can be heard threatening to call the police. “I’m going to tell them there’s an African-American man threatening my life.”

On the video she repeats her threat several times, and then appears to make the call, sounding increasingly distressed despite Christian apparently being far away from her. In fact, at one point before she calls she approaches him and he responds, “Please don’t come close to me.”

On the phone, Amy says, “There’s a man, an African-American, he’s recording and threatening me and my dog.”

“There is an African-American man in Central Park. He is recording me and threatening myself and my dog,” she continues.

“I am being threatened by a man in the bramble!” she says, shouting, incorrectly referring to the portion of Central Park known as The Ramble. “Please send the police immediately!”

Christian, who is a birder, “says he only asked Amy to put her dog on the leash in the area where it’s required to have your dog on a leash at all times.”

“If the habitat is destroyed we won’t be able to go there to see the birds, to enjoy the plantings,” Christian told NBC. He offered Amy’s dog a treat in an effort to get her to leash the dog. “The only way they can keep the dog from eating the treat is to put it on a leash.”

“At some point, she decided, ‘I’m gonna play the race card,’ I guess,” he said.

And he says he started recording because he refused to be intimidated by Amy.

“I’m not going to participate in my own dehumanization. I’m not going to feed into this,” he said. “We live in an age of Ahmaud Arbery where black men are gunned down because of assumptions people make about black men, black people, and I’m just not going to participate in that.”

Once Amy leashed her dog Christian thanked her and stopped recording.

On social media “Amy Cooper” trended, with many accusing her of engaging in racism and intentionally threatening Christian’s life. Many were also concerned about how she handled her dog. In the video she grabbed him by the collar and he appeared to be struggling or choking for nearly a minute.

There are countless examples of police shooting to death Black people, mostly Black men, often for no apparent reason, and often after someone calls 911.

Amy, who has been placed on administrative leave by her employer in response to her handling of the incident, offered an apology.

“I sincerely and humbly apologize to everyone, especially to that man, his family,” she told NBC. “It was unacceptable and I humbly and fully apologize to everyone who’s seen that video, everyone that’s been offended…everyone who thinks of me in a lower light and I understand why they do.”

“When I think about the police, I’m such a blessed person. I’ve come to realize especially today that I think of [the police] as a protection agency, and unfortunately, this has caused me to realize that there are so many people in this country that don’t have that luxury.”

She has also voluntarily surrendered her dog to Abandoned Angels Cocker Spaniel Rescue, which says: “The dog is now in our rescue’s care and he is safe and in good health.”

Police have called the incident a “verbal dispute” and made no arrest.

Christian is being called a hero on social media."

Zachary Greenberg is believed to be the man seen on video punching Hayden Williams, a conservative activist who was on campus helping Turning Point USA recruit members. In the video, two men are exchanging words with Williams, and one of them begins shoving the activist before punching him in the face.

Williams said the encounter started over a sign reading, “Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,” in reference to the recent accusation from “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.

Williams’ attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, told The Daily Caller that a “not guilty” please wasn’t surprising.

“It is customary for criminal defendants to enter a not guilty plea, so I’m not surprised by that,” Dhillon said, adding that Greenberg has apparently had other brushes “with the court system.”

Greenberg’s attorney, Alana Coopersmith, told reporters on Wednesday that her client is innocent until proven guilty.

“He was using the library at UC Berkeley to study,” she said. “He has a clean record. I realize that many people observing this case are interested in constitutional freedom. I would remind them that one important constitutional freedom is the presumption of innocence, due process of law, due process in a courtroom, not on social media or the internet.”

Greenberg is also not a Berkeley student.

Greenberg was charged with three felonies for assault, battery, and criminal threats. He also faces a misdemeanor vandalism charge. If convicted, he could face up to four years in prison, according to the College Fix.

KTVU crime reporter Henry Lee tweeted video of Greenberg leaving the courtroom and his attorney’s statement.

It is possible that Greenberg isn’t the man seen in the video. Appearances can be deceiving. Conservatives, including TP USA president Charlie Kirk, criticized Berkeley and local police for taking too long to find the suspect. The attack occurred on February 19, and Greenberg was identified, according to Berkeley officials, a week later. He was arrested on March 1.

That honestly doesn’t sound like they were dragging their feet, especially if Greenberg wasn’t a student.

Though conservatives were rightly outraged that one of their own was actually attacked for his political views, media outlets (who had spread Smollett’s implausible claims far and wide) barely reported the incident. When Newsweek reported the story, it used the word “allegedly” to describe the attack, something it didn’t do with Smollett’s claim. Perhaps they finally learned their lesson after all the hoaxes, but that seems unlikely

The Washington Post didn’t initially report the story, and when it finally did, it reported it from the angle that “the response enraged the right,” making it clear the Left was perfectly okay with this kind of violence."

*Actor Ian McKellen, aka Gandalf, said Kevin Spacey and Bryan Singer abused others because of the pressure of being “in the closet.”

*A school in Great Britain agreed to stop teaching Rainbow Jihad propaganda because – wait for it – hundreds of Muslims protested and pulled their kids out of school.

*The top aide of savior of the proletariat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is alleged to have funneled more than $1 million in political donations into two of his own private companies, according to a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission. The companies may have been established for the very purpose of making the use of those political donations hard to follow. Oh, and she also called the black staffers or employees of Republicans “tokens.”

Are these people fools? Yes.

Are these people easy to laugh at? Yes.

Are these people to be taken seriously? Sadly, the answer is, again, yes.

While they make for excellent clickbait, they’re the ones actually laughing all the way to the bank. They control pop culture, academia, the media, and the bureaucracy. Other than that, I’m saying there’s a chance. So while we’re “owning the libs,” they’re owning our cultural devolution. Hell, they even make us subsidize it. And when we do win elections, the unelected judges render those elections all but pointless. Because, of course, they must always be obeyed no matter what rotgut they conjure up from the bowels of their depraved minds.

Which is exactly why there will be a new batch of zany high jinks I look forward to writing about next week, too. That bait ain’t gonna click itself!"

After predictions of widespread racist, homophobic, and sexist attacks in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 election completely flopped, many chose to either fake hate crimes or blame everyday occurrences on a supposed hate crime wave.

The latter is apparently what happened to a South Carolina mayor in early February after a “grainy substance” was found on her car.

As Newsweek reports, the husband of Lamar Mayor Darnell Byrd McPherson first discovered the substance coating the couple’s cars and scraped it off the vehicles with the help of a neighbor. But the mayor’s suspicions didn’t go away.

“I likened it as a hate crime because No. 1, there’s a history in our town of Lamar,” McPherson said. Although there was nothing written in the substance, the mayor found it to be just as haunting.

“To me that was the message,” McPherson said.

The police were quickly called. Law enforcement began to investigate the supposed hate crime in the town, which Newsweek reported has a population of only about 980.

Deputies from the Darlington County Sheriff’s Office were the first to respond.

Despite the fact that the mayor had the cars cleaned and pressure-washed twice after the incident, so evidence was a little lacking, but investigators did some quick detective work and had a pretty good idea what the mystery substance was.

“We found it to be pollen,” DCSO Lieutenant Robby Kilgo told Newsweek. “There was no reason for us to collect a sample.”

The story of McPherson’s claim soon flooded Twitter.

McPherson was not entirely convinced by the investigation.

“It’s something. Something that’s sticky that’s stuck to my car and took two different solutions to get it off,” she said, according to Newsweek.

Because the mayor was so adamant that the substance was part of an intentional attack, the the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, was called. They weren’t buying McPherson’s claims either.

“We reviewed the incident report, but we did not open a formal investigation,” a SLED spokeswoman told Newsweek, also saying that the law enforcement group “did not believe a crime occurred.”

McPherson’s misidentification of pollen is definitely a head-scratcher. Assuming she’s a longtime resident of the southern United States, the yearly yellow dusting shouldn’t be a new phenomenon.

Perhaps fear got the best of the politician. The media climate isn’t exactly calming when it comes to covering alleged hate crimes.

The way the mainstream media covered Jussie Smollett, the Covington Catholic High School boys, and other instances of supposed hate crime shows the single-sided narrative and fear-mongering the news media can foster.

Whether it’s a case of nerves or a simple mistake, hopefully residents of Lamar, South Carolina, can sleep soundly knowing there’s not a serial car-coating vandal on the loose.

But spring is coming.

The 28-year-old was arrested on Friday.

Williams, who is a field representative for The Leadership Institute, was recruiting for the conservative group Turning Point USA at UC-Berkeley before he was attacked.

Williams was standing next to a table with a sign that read, “Hate Crimes Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,” talking about the case of actor Jussie Smollett, who is accused of staging a hate crime against himself in Chicago in January, KPIX reported. Williams said he was approached by two men who were angered over the signs.

He was punched in the face by one of the men during the confrontation that followed.

And it’s extremely likely that Greenberg will be convicted because of the video evidence against him.

Even if Greenberg doesn’t do time in the case, justice will be served because his name will likely forever be connected to the video of the assault.

It wasn’t clear what exactly Greenberg was doing that day, on the campus of a college he hasn’t attended in years.

UC-Berkeley spokeswoman Diana Harvey said Greenberg briefly attended the college in 2010, when he worked as a lab assistant in the psychology department, according to Campus Reform.

After Greenberg’s first court appearance, where he pleaded not guilty, defense attorney Alanna Coopersmith also stated that Greenberg isn’t a student a UC-Berkeley.

While Greenberg’s future is probably ruined by this foolish and stupid attack, Williams had the opportunity to meet with President Donald Trump and speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday.

“It’s great that I’m being recognized,” Williams said, “but there’s so many conservative students across the country who are facing discrimination, harassment and worse if they dare to speak up on campus.

“I’m glad we could bring this to the forefront. And I’d just like to say, if these socialists/progressives had their way, they would put our Constitution through the paper shredder in a heartbeat.”

There are many more people like Williams’ attacker out there lurking college campuses, as Williams’ is just the latest incident of many that have occurred in recent years.

As Williams wrote in a commentary piece published by USA Today on Wednesday:

“Conservative students across the country have suffered verbal and physical assault, social ostracism and even academic persecution for voicing their opinions on political topics. This is because young liberals believe that they are on the morally righteous side in a culture war and, in order to win, they must silence any form of dissent. Leftists and the progressives aspire to nothing less than to make it de facto impossible to be conservative in public.”

It’s sweet justice that the accused attacker had to go to court just days after the person he assaulted got to meet the president of the United States.

Chicago police think it’s a hoax, and have charged Smollett with a felony.

If Smollett is convicted, he will have rightfully earned the scorn that so many have directed his way. However, Smollett is responsible for a monumental, if temporary, shift in American thinking:

People are starting to understand that piling-on in a “breaking situation,” with shoot-from-the-hip accusations, is a recipe for disaster. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault with zero evidence, yet many politicized it and condemned him as guilty. And Covington, Kentucky, high schooler Nick Sandmann was excoriated for being an alleged racist because of his demeanor with a Native American, yet video evidence showed otherwise.

Maybe the Smollett saga will be America’s wake-up call to stop posting baseless accusations after hearing a story confirming our biases. And maybe people will reserve judgments until knowing the facts. After all, in the age of instant media, damnation in the Court of Public Opinion often carries stiffer repercussions than a court of law.

The most important aspect of the Smollett case is innocent until proven guilty. The Chicago police department’s evidence doesn’t paint a flattering picture, but that’s why we have trials. In high-profile cases, information is leaked which is often inaccurate. And in the media’s quest to out-scoop each other, some of that erroneous “news” is reported without verification. No matter how nefarious Mr. Smollett may appear, he is entitled to his day in court.

Chicago police officials are making their rounds on national news shows, contending there is ample evidence which the public has not yet seen.

That’s not fair. If you have evidence, release it. Otherwise, keep it close to the vest and stay quiet. Instead, they are slamming Smollett by teasing about all the “secret” evidence they have. But because they aren’t releasing it, he has no way to defend himself. And they are risking having a conviction thrown out by acting in a way that could affect the bias of a jury.

Heaven help the Chicago PD if their evidence doesn’t stack up. They better have a lot more than some innocuous text messages and the $3,500 check Smollett wrote to his alleged partner/assailant, given that the check was written to his trainer for a diet and exercise regime. Maybe that was a bogus reason, but it’s not what you know; it’s what you can prove. And if Smollett can prove he used this individual in the past as a personal trainer, then that check is worthless.

If Smollett beats the charges due to inadequate evidence or police foul-ups, the anti-police movement will explode. The narrative will be simple: a black man was attacked, called a liar, charged, then exonerated due to corrupt police railroading an innocent man. It would be irrelevant if that were untrue. Perception is reality, and much of the public’s perception would be that police are bigoted and untrustworthy.

A quick tangent. The Chicago Police Superintendent fumed that Smollett’s actions “dragged Chicago’s reputation through the mud.” Sorry, Chief, but Chicago’s reputation was in the mud long before Jussie. Downtown is fantastic, and Wrigley is a must-see, but Chi-town consistently has the most murders, by far, of any American city. Parts are so dangerous that it is literally safer to be a soldier in Iraq. That sad state of affairs has nothing to do with Jussie Smollett.

Mr. Smollett claims that his assailants placed a noose around his neck, which was still there when he spoke with police. If this turns out to be a hoax, one can only imagine the pain and disappointment of Smollett’s grandfathers (and other blacks of that generation) for whom lynching was a very real threat. For them, a noose represented the most horrifying brand of racism. For Smollett, if faked, it was just another meaningless prop from a make-believe movie set. And that would be the most shameful act of all.

Lastly, Hollywood prides itself for its Leftist values. If Smollett perpetrated a hoax, he would have made an absolute mockery of Hollywood’s biggest issues: promoting diversity and the LBGTQ agenda.

To avoid massive hypocrisy, Hollywood has but one choice: blackball Jussie Smollett from working in Tinseltown, for at least a decade. He can rehabilitate himself by working a “regular” job. But affording Smollett celebrity status, after he drove a stake through everything Hollywood holds dear, would expose the industry’s political advocacy as a complete sham, where money talks, principles walk, and backbone is nonexistent.

Here’s hoping that we proceed with an open mind, respect the rights of the accused, and remember that not everything is as simple as…black and white.

For the first time in years, the drumbeat of civil war has become audible across the United States. The nation looks destined to repeat history thanks to a media that is no longer able to objectively perform its job.

The predominantly left-leaning US media has just entered its third consecutive year of open warfare against Donald Trump. This non-stop assault risks aggravating political passions to the point where ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ snowballs into something completely beyond our ability to control. Like full-blown Civil War.

Over the weekend, the Washington Post, one of most prominent serial producers of partisan agitation, published an article entitled, ‘In America, talk turns to something unspoken for 150 years: Civil War’. The piece, which deftly places Democrats above the fray, opens with the following whiff of grapeshot:

“With the report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III reportedly nearly complete, impeachment talk in the air and the 2020 presidential election ramping up... there’s talk of violence, mayhem and, increasingly, civil war,” the Bezos-owned paper forewarned.

CNN Asks What Would Happen If Trump Refuses to Accept Defeat in 2020 https://t.co/Rw1r0TqUrz — Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) February 24, 2019

With a level of audacity and self-righteousness that has become a trademark of the Left, not once did the article float the possibility that just maybe the mainstream media is complicit in the ongoing deterioration of political discourse, or that the Democrats are just as much to blame as the Republicans for the political fallout that now presents a grave risk to the Republic.

As many knowledgeable Americans will openly admit, battle lines have been drawn across the political and cultural frontier. This division is perhaps most conspicuous on social media, where friends and family who disagree with our political worldview get the ‘nuke option’ and are effortlessly vanquished (‘unfriended’) with the push of a button. This is a worrying development. The real danger will come when Americans from both sides of the political divide stop talking and start erecting electronic barriers around their political belief systems. Not even family members are spared from the tumult; just because people share the same bloodline does not automatically mean they share the same political views. America, though still green behind the ears, may understand that fact better than many other countries.

The United States has taken part in its fair share of military conflicts over the years, but its deadliest war to date has been the one that pitted Americans against each other. The so-called Civil War (1861-1865), waged between the North and South over the question of Southern secession from the Union, resulted in the death of some 620,000 soldiers from the Union and Confederate armies (and possibly as high as 850,000, according to other estimates).

Put another way, more Americans died in the Civil War than in all of the country’s other conflicts combined. For a country that has been at war for much of its existence that is a sobering fact.

With that historical footnote in mind, the mainstream media should better appreciate its responsibility for presenting an objective and balanced depiction of modern events. Yet nothing today would suggest that is the case. One need only look at the way it has blotched recent politically charged events – like the Covington High School and Jussie Smollett scandals, not to mention the ‘Russia collusion’ hoax – to say that something is seriously out of whack inside of the Fourth Estate. The muzzled mainstream media has simply lost its mind over Donald Trump and can no longer perform its duties with any discernible amount of objectivity.

Indeed, the US leader continues to serve as a piñata for the agenda-driven media, which takes daily swings at him and his administration – and despite the fact that his popularity remains very high among voters. Only on the fringes of the media world, in the far away land of Fox News and Breitbart, will the reader find level-headed reports on the American president. This is not to suggest, of course, that Trump is beyond criticism. Not at all. There is a lot not to like about the 45th president. At the same time, however, to assume that Trump and his administration is the root of all evil, as the media would lead us to believe, is not only ridiculous, it is outright dangerous.

With no loss of irony, a good example of the media bias against Trump can be found in the very Post article that frets over the outbreak of another Civil War. While everyone knows that it takes two to tango, you would never guess that by reading this piece. In the sheltered world of the Liberal-dominated media, ‘tango’ is a solo event where the political right is portrayed as engaged in a dance with itself, while the political left watches – innocuously, of course – from the sidelines.

Michael Cohen, for example, Trump’s turncoat personal lawyer who committed perjury by lying to Congress, was quoted high in the article as saying, “Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power.”

Now that is certainly rich. Ever since Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, Washington has been consumed by the Mueller investigation, and amid mindless chatter that Trump is an illegitimate president slated for impeachment. In other words, the last thing that can be said about the Democrats is that they facilitated a “peaceful transition of power.” In fact, they have hobbled Trump and his administration ever since he entered the Oval Office.

Another pro-Liberal voice dragged into the Civil War story was Robert Reich, who served on Barack Obama's economic transition advisory board. The Post linked to an article Reich wrote last year where he posited the fictional scenario where an impeachment resolution against the president is enacted, thus kicking off mass civil strife on the direct command of dear leader.

“Trump claims it's the work of the ‘deep state’”, according to Reich’s febrile imagination. “Sean Hannity of Fox News demands that every honest patriot take to the streets. Right-wing social media call for war. As insurrection spreads, Mr. Trump commands the armed forces to side with the ‘patriots.’” “The way Mr. Trump and his defenders are behaving, it’s not absurd to imagine serious social unrest,” Reich continued. “That’s how low he’s taken us.”

Now that is some world-class chutzpah. In fact, it is the same self-righteous, ingratiating tone that weaves itself throughout the Post article. In keeping with the mainstream media’s non-stop narrative, Trump and the Republicans are blamed for everything that has gone wrong in the country, while the Democrats come off as little angels trying to piece the fractured country back together.

As already mentioned, Donald Trump is certainly not above criticism. Far from it. But for the mainstream media to place all of the blame for the current political malaise at the Republican’s door is about as responsible as lighting up a cigarette inside of a Chinese fireworks factory. The US media has an unmistakable agenda, and that is to make damn sure Trump is not reelected to another term in 2020. To that end, it has shown a devious willingness to betray all journalistic ethics and standards, which has the effect of increasing the political temperature to boiling point. It then points the finger of blame at the political right for the accumulated pile of pent-up tensions, which are ready to ignite at the first spark.

If the mainstream media continues to slavishly serve just one political master over another, it will only have itself to blame for what comes next. Its prejudiced and agenda-based reporting is a disgrace and really nothing short of a bona fide national security threat."

Zachary Greenberg, a 28-year-old software engineer, gave his plea at the Wiley W. Manuel Courthouse in Oakland. The Alameda County District Attorney’s office filed three criminal felony charges and one misdemeanor charge against Greenberg on Tuesday.

Harmeet Dhillon, the attorney for Hayden Williams, the victim of the alleged assault, tweeted that Greenberg was ordered to stay off the UC-Berkeley campus, and away from her client. Dhillon, who attended the arraignment, also said the court granted Greenberg's request to have his personal information redacted from public records because he was being harassed and threatened.

The felony counts relate to assault and causing or intending bodily injury, and criminal threats. A misdemeanor count is related to vandalism, the complaint shows.

The charges came five days after police arrested Greenberg for allegedly attacking Williams, who is 26, while he was manning a recruitment table on campus for the conservative group Turning Point USA.

“We are pleased that the good investigative work of our police department has led to the filing of these charges,” Dan Mogoluf, assistant vice chancellor at UC-Berkeley, told Fox News on Tuesday. “The university believes that those who violate the free-speech rights of others must be held accountable and face the appropriate consequences.”

UC-BERKELEY REOPENS INVESTIGATION INTO ASSAULT ON CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST, DAYS AFTER ANNOUNCING ITS END

Williams, who is not a student, but rather a field representative for the conservative group The Leadership Institute, was helping Turning Point USA, which is launching a chapter on the campus, to hand out recruitment materials when Greenberg and another man approached him, he said to Fox News.

Williams said Greenberg took exception to pro-Trump signs, as well as one that criticized false hate-crime allegations, in an apparent reference to the case of actor Jussie Smollett, the TV actor accused of fabricating a racist and homophobic assault. In a confrontation captured on cellphone video, the person Williams identified as Greenberg use vulgarities and taunted the activist. As Williams recorded him with his phone, the man attempted to grab it, knocked over the table and ripped signs.

Greenberg’s criminal defense attorney, Alanna Coopersmith, said Wednesday her client had been studying in the UC-Berkeley library the day of the attack, though he doesn’t attend Berkeley. He attends another nearby college, she said.

“He has a clean record,"" Coopersmith told reporters outside the courtroom as Greenberg stood at her side. ""I understand many people observing this case are interested in constitutional freedom and I would remind them that one important constitutional freedom is the presumption of innocence, due process of law and due process in a courtroom, not on social media or the Internet.""

She said it was premature to comment on the substance of the case.

Dhillon told Fox News that she is optimistic that her client will get justice.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo released the statement through their attorney Gloria Schmidt to CNN.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” Schmidt told CNN on Thursday.

Smollett filed a police report that two men attacked him and shouted homophobic and racial slurs at him in Chicago on Jan. 29. While investigating the report, Chicago Police brought in the Osundairo brothers, acquaintances of Smollett’s, for questioning. The brothers were released without charges.

Smollett eventually was charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He turned himself into police on Feb. 21. The same day at a press conference, Chicago Police Chief Eddie Johnson said that Smollett paid the brothers $3,500 for the attack. According to Johnson, Smollett staged the attack because he was unhappy with his “Empire” salary.

Both Smollett’s reps and Fox have denied that Smollett ever expressed dissatisfaction with his pay. Police did obtain a check from Smollett to one of the brothers, who is a personal trainer, but the memo line read that it was for a fitness and nutritional plan for an upcoming music video.

Smollett says he is innocent and his lawyers have promised an “aggressive defense.” He returns to court on March 14."

She said as much in a new episode of Yahoo News' Through Her Eyes, which premiered on the site Tuesday morning (March 5).

While there are pieces of evidence against Smollett, Latifah hasn't seen enough.

“Until somebody can show me some proof otherwise, I’m going with him,” she says in a clip from the interview. “The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet. And that's the guy I know.”

In January, Smollett told police that he was attacked by two white men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him before putting a noose around his neck. Chicago police initially called it a possible hate crime, but after a thorough investigation, they accused the actor of hiring two brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo. At least one of the actors had appeared in an episode of Empire.

Over the last few weeks, police have compiled pieces of evidence for their case, picking out footage of the two brothers buying red hats and other items said to be used in the alleged attack. Authorities have also pointed toward text messages Smollett exchanged with the brothers in the days leading up to the alleged attack as potential evidence.

On Feb. 21, Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a fake police report, which is Class 4 felony that is punishable by up to three years in prison. He posted bond and was released that same day. Smollett is due back in court on March 14.

Despite all of these developments, Latifah isn't ready to turn on Smollett.

“Until I can see some definitive proof—which I haven’t seen yet—then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise,” she reaffirms toward the end of the clip. “All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.”

Today he had his first court appearance where he pleaded not guilty to the charges. Video shot by KTVU’s Henry Lee shows Greenberg said nothing on the way into the hearing but his attorney did comment briefly on the way out:

“I realize that many people observing this case are interested in constitutional freedom,” the attorney said. She added, “I would remind that one important constitutional freedom is the presumption of innocence, due process of law, due process in a courtroom, not on social media or the internet.”

Clearly, she’s aware that her client is not well liked outside of Berkeley. And of course, she’s absolutely right that he’s entitled to due process. As for the presumption of innocence, that still exists but in this case we’ve all seen the video, including the punch and the threat to shoot Hayden Williams. If she get a judge or jury to overlook all of that she’s a hell of an attorney.

The Free Beacon’s David Rutz posted a copy of the court documents on Twitter yesterday. They specify four charges: “Three felonies: assault, battery with serious bodily injury, criminal threats. One misdemeanor: vandalism.”

Three felonies: assault, battery with serious bodily injury, criminal threats. One misdemeanor: vandalism. He'll be arraigned tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/nEhPn2E4L3 — David Rutz (@DavidRutz) March 5, 2019

The assault and battery charges refer to the punching and grabbing of Hayden Williams. The criminal threat isn’t specified but is almost certainly the verbal threat to shoot Williams. Finally, the misdemeanor charge was for damage to Williams’ cell phone. Greenberg (allegedly) knocked the phone to the ground after Williams pulled it out and began filming him with it.

USA Today published a piece today by Hayden Williams, the victim in the attack. Williams describes the experience of the last two weeks as “surreal” and says that what happened to him is the consequence of a far-left ideology which equates differing opinions with violence.

Increasingly, leftists believe they are justified to respond to ideas disagreeable to them with open hostility and even force. Students are commonly told now that words are literally violent and can be responded to with physical force. I don’t mean verbal threats of violence or efforts to intimidate, I mean words that express ideas that the listener finds offensive or disagrees with. The message that provoked my attacker was our sign that read “Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,” a reference to the recent case of Jussie Smollett, who was charged by Chicago police with filing a false police report about an apparently fictitious attack. My attacker said we were promoting violence, which, in his view, gives him permission to use any means necessary to shut us down. The irony is that the sign was intended to warn of the danger of disregarding facts and jumping to judgment in an effort to confirm a narrative our feelings tell us is true.

It’s not even arguable that’s what happened here. There were two men who approached Williams on the Berkeley campus last month. One of them pointed to his table and his signs referencing the Smollett case and said, “You are f**king encouraging violence.” Seconds later, Greenberg (allegedly) knocked the phone out of Williams’ hand and then flipped over the table full of offensive messages. The conflict escalated from there but it started with the claim that political speech was encouraging violence. Here’s the clip put together by the College Fix:"

Will Smith ‘casting as Richard Williams’ sparks colourism debate Richard Williams, 77, coached his daughters to become two of the world’s greatest tennis players, despite having no previous experience of the game.

Police investigated the claims made by Lamar Mayor Darnell Byrd McPherson, who reported that someone sprayed her 2017 Symphony Silver Hyundai Elantra Sport with a residue outside their home on February 7. The Mayor of the South Carolina town also claimed her husband’s soft-top 1998 Buick Roadmaster had been sprayed with a substance which ‘got in all of the grooves’ of the gray sedan. Newsweek reported that McPherson had returned to her home and claimed her husband “went out to the car to get some things out of the garage. He says, “Somebody’s painted your car!.”‘ In a statement to WPDE-TV before police investigated the incident, the mayor said: ‘During the 70s, crosses were burned in the yard of our home when my mother was involved with the civil rights movement. ‘Again, we are grateful the person or persons did not try to take our lives but the culprits will be identified and prosecuted. Love conquers hate and my husband and I refuse to be intimidated by those who perpetrated this act of vandalism which I classify as an act of hatred.’

Kelly swears he “didn’t do this stuff” and he’s “fighting for his life” in his first interview since “Surviving R. Kelly” dropped and new allegations of sex abuse surfaced.

“I’m very tired of all of the um, lies, I’ve been hearing things and seeing things on the blogs, and I’m just tired,” he told Gayle King on “CBS This Morning” on Wednesday.

The lies that bothered Kelly most, he said, included “that little girls trapped in a basement, helicopters over my house, trying to rescue someone who doesn’t need to be rescued because they’re not in my house.”

“[I did] lots of things wrong when it comes to women but I apologized in those relationships,” he said. He adamantly denied breaking any laws when it comes to women.

“Everybody says something bad about me. Nobody said something good. They was describing Lucifer. I’m not Lucifer. I’m a man. I made mistakes, but I’m not a devil.”

Kelly blamed “the power of social media” for spreading rumors about his alleged abuse and giving them traction.

“No. No. No,” he said when asked if he’d ever had sex with any minors, adding that his accusers were “absolutely” lying. “I have been assassinated. I have been buried alive from these lies.”

“I don’t need to. Why would I? How stupid would it be for R. Kelly, with all that I’ve been through in my way, way, past to hold somebody — that’s stupid,” he shouted.

He fumed, “That’s stupid! Use your common sense. Forget the blogs, forget how you feel about me. Hate me if you want to, love me if you want. But just use your common sense. How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I’ve been through — ‘Oh, right now I just think I need to be a monster and hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and don’t let them eat, don’t let them out, unless they need some shoes down the street from their uncle!’”

Kelly then got up and shrieked, sobbing, “Stop it. You don’t quit playing. Quit playing. I didn’t do this stuff! This is not me! I’m fighting for my f—king life!”

He cried, “It’s not about music, it’s about having a relationship with my kids.”

“I need help. This is the kind of help I need. I need somebody to help me not have a big heart. My heart is so big. People betray me and I keep on giving to them.”

Kelly was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 that centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

Queen Latifah is standing by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.

The “Girl’s Trip” actress said she supports the publicly scrutinized actor after he was arrested last month and charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report for a hate crime he allegedly staged against himself in January.

“The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet,” Latifah, 48, told Zainab Salbi, host of Yahoo News show “Through Her Eyes.” “And that’s just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof – which I haven’t seen yet – then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.”

She said she simply hopes “everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.” Latifah once appeared on “Empire” during a crossover episode with FOX’s “Star,” a series that she is a regular.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said last month that Smollett, 36, orchestrated a “phony attack” in order to take “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Kate Beckinsale gave a sassy response when a fan mentioned Pete Davidson after they were reportedly spotted cozying up at a party Sunday.

A North Carolina man who opposes Confederate monuments on Capitol grounds was arrested after placing white hoods on the Monument to North Carolina Women of the Confederacy.

Jonathan Alan Williams, 42, shared a photo on Twitter of white hoods on the statue, which was dedicated in 1914 and features a woman and a young boy, but police say he is responsible for putting them there, according to the News & Observer.

“Huh. That’s new,” Williams tweeted.

The apparent message being that members of the Confederacy are members of the Ku Klux Klan.

Williams, who expressed shock over the incident, told the newspaper he walked by the statue Monday morning to see if barricades were still up after a protest Saturday night and that’s when he saw the white hoods and took the photo.

State Capitol Police arrested Williams later that day, charging him with misdemeanor littering for allegedly putting the hoods on the statue, the News & Observer reported.

He responded to the paper in a pair of tweets: “The News & Observer accusing me of some kind of false flag conspiracy is certainly a take,” the first tweet said, following by: “utter f–king dipshits.”

utter fucking dipshits — Jon Williams (@shovemedia) March 5, 2019

In yet another tweet, Williams suggested the hoax wasn’t a hoax — he did reportedly tell the News & Observer he found the white hoods on the statue.

I knew there was a risk some people would misinterpret hoods-on-racist-monuments as a false flag hate crime. Fortunately, the vast vast majority of folks appear to be more clever than that. — Jon Williams (@shovemedia) March 6, 2019

The story comes on the heels of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett claiming that he was the victim of a hate crime, being attacked by two white Trump supporters, only to be arrested after an extensive investigation and charged with staging the hoax attack.

Damning evidence suggests that Smollett hired actors to stage the fake crime, paying two Nigerian $3,500 to pull it off.

Though it appears that the two men have something in common, as Smollett is also declaring his innocence — to be fair, Williams didn’t actually say he was innocent, but he is asserting that is was not a “false flag hate crime.”

What both incidents do confirm is the gullibility of the media to jump on stories that push a racist narrative. Some would argue that it goes beyond gullibility, as the media has a similar agenda.

One thing is certain, given the platform Smollett was granted to broadcast his claims, the media provides plenty of motivation to generate stories to their liking."

The “Good Morning America” co-host sat down with the “Empire” actor on Feb. 12 to discuss the alleged hate crime against him. Just over a week later, he was arrested for making a false police report. (He maintains his innocence.) Roberts talked about how her interview came to be, including doubts she had about doing it in the first place, as well as the criticism she’s faced since it aired, describing it as a “no-win situation.”

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like, ‘I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,’” the morning TV personality said during The Cut’s “How I Get It Done” event on Monday. “I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up.’ And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

His handlers made it enticing, saying that the star would reveal new details about the so-called hate crime and Roberts was told she could challenge him about the “red flags” she saw in his story. “I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy,’” she recalled. “He’s going to go on record for the first time. Yes, I’ll do the interview.”

On the day of the interview, it started two-and-a-half hours late. She tried to be as “neutral” as possible, saying, “I pride myself in being fair.” And Smollett was considered a victim at the time. However, she talked about challenging him, including when, after he said he “couldn’t believe people didn’t believe him,” pointing out, “Well, I go, ‘You’re out at 2 in the morning, you’re getting a sandwich, [and] you won’t give up your phone.’”

Roberts also said she felt pressure to represent the LGBT community during the sit-down. “I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man,” she said. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.’”

She concluded, “It was a no-win situation for me.”

The interview aired two days later on Feb. 14 and by then the two Nigerian brothers — Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo — were in police custody and claimed that they were paid by the actor to stage the attack.

“People are looking at the interview through the eyes of ‘How did you not know?’” Roberts recalled. “I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.”

She admitted, “It was one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do” because “all I wanted was to get to the truth. All I wanted was to give the truth.” And the criticism over it “was hurtful, some of the things that were said. I’ll be honest.”

Smollett turned himself into police on Feb. 21. At the time, Roberts called it “a setback for race relations, homophobia, MAGA supporters. I cannot think of another case where there is this anger on so many sides, and you can understand why there would be.”

The actor, who is out on bond, is set to appear in court on March 14."

The man accused of assaulting a conservative activist at the University of California–Berkeley has been charged with three felonies and a misdemeanor, according to Alameda Superior Court online records.

Zachary Greenberg, 28, was charged March 5 with assault “likely to produce great bodily injury,” battery with serious bodily injury, criminal threats, and the misdemeanor—vandalism with damage of less than $400.

If convicted, the first two felony charges carry sentences of up to four years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000; the third charge could result in a maximum of one year in prison. The misdemeanor may result in jail time of up to a year and a fine of up to $1,000.

On March 1, campus police booked Greenberg into jail after he was believed to be the man who was caught on camera punching conservative activist Hayden Williams on the university’s campus on Feb. 19.

Greenberg allegedly hit Williams multiple times, including one punch directly in the face, which was caught on video and widely circulated online.

Greenberg’s bail was set at $30,000, KTVU’s Henry Lee reported.

Greenberg wasn’t in custody as of March 6; his arraignment was scheduled for 9 a.m. that day at the Wiley W. Manuel Courthouse, online records show.

Sucker Punch

The incident happened when Williams was manning a table recruiting for Turning Point USA (TPUSA), a conservative student organization that operates on 1,400 campuses.

Williams told The Epoch Times’ “American Thought Leaders” show that the display included signs reading, “Hate crime hoaxes hurt real victims” and “This is MAGA Country”—a reference to the case of Jussie Smollett, a TV actor charged with staging a racially motivated attack on himself and framing supporters of President Donald Trump by claiming the attackers referenced Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.”

At some point, Williams was approached by two men who verbally accosted him. He said he started to record the men with his phone about six to seven seconds into the confrontation.

One of the men, alleged to be Greenberg, knocked the phone from his hand. Williams picked up the phone and continued recording. The man started to shove and drag him. “You want to hit me? I’m going to shoot your [expletive],” he said at one point. Finally, after hurling several more curses and insults, he punched Williams in the face and promptly left, leaving Williams with a badly swollen eye.

Williams is a field representative for the conservative Leadership Institute, a training organization for conservative activists. Neither he nor Greenberg was a student of or is employed at the university, the university said.

My friend, Hayden, wants to thank all of you for the love and support. He’s giving you a wink, and wanted to let you know you’ll be hearing from him soon! pic.twitter.com/6kPmFZgQgz — Brad Devlin (@bradleydevlin) February 21, 2019

Williams Responds

Williams said his approach to the incident, such as recording it, followed some recommendations of the Leadership Institute.

“That’s really the only way we can hold these people accountable, is by first and foremost, is documenting these incidents as they happen,” Williams told Fox News. “And that’s really one thing we teach at Leadership Institute, is just try and record everything, and don’t retaliate, because the left will use anything they can to try to distort the facts.”

Williams’s attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, said she was pleased to see progress in the case, though she pointed to a previous case of 2017, when Eric Clanton, a former community college professor, hit a Trump supporter on the head with a bike lock during a rally at the campus. The Alameda County District Attorney’s office let Clanton off with three years of probation.

“We’re happy that the authorities seem to be taking this seriously, but we’ll suspend judgment on how seriously until we see the resolution of this case,” Dhillon said.

She called the attack “the very epitome of fascism, the use of violence to silence your opponents and making people afraid of expressing their views.”

Trump Responds

During the annual CPAC conference on March 2, Trump brought Williams on stage, saying, “he took a hard punch in the face for all of us.”

Williams said many students across the country face attacks and intimidation if they express their conservative values or support for the president.

“These students do it because they have a love of our nation and freedom and, frankly, a love for you, Mr. President,” he said. “So, if you keep defending us, we’ll keep defending you.”

Trump recommended that Williams sue Greenberg, the university, “and maybe sue the state.”

“Here’s the good news,” Trump said. “He’s going to be a very wealthy young man. That’s OK. Go get them, Hayden!”

Trump announced, to long and thunderous applause, that he’ll issue “an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech if they want federal research dollars.”

University Responds

In response to the Feb. 19 incident, university officials repeatedly condemned the attack and pledged commitment to free speech.

“We readily admit that this university … is unable to prevent a lone bad actor who was neither employee or student from engaging in reprehensible behavior on a campus spanning 1,200 acres and a population of 50,000 people,” Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said in a March 2 release.

“We don’t see a way to do that, but that doesn’t mean our police force and the administration don’t awaken every morning trying their best to deter criminal behavior and keep our campus safe.”

The university was forced to step up its efforts to protect free speech after a national outcry over how it handled disruptions of prominent conservative speakers on campus, including protests and riots by far-left groups that had ramped up since the 2016 elections.

Mogulof said that in 2018, the university spent more than $4 million “to ensure that our conservative students could safely and successfully hold events on campus and invite speakers of their choice to these events.”

Conservative student groups have since hosted a number of speakers on campus, Mogulof said, including TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk, Rick Santorum, Dennis Prager, Heather MacDonald, Candace Owens, Dave Rubin, Steve Simpson, Antonia Okafor, and Allie Stuckey.

“Not a single disruption. No opposition. No protest. No [media] coverage,” he said."

Kelly said he is “fighting” for his life.

The “Trapped in the Closet” singer was indicted back in early February on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

The charges stemmed from a January documentary series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired on the Lifetime network. Multiple females and former colleagues accused Kelly of holding women against their will and of preying on underage girls in the docuseries.

This has not been the first time Kelly has dealt with sexual misconduct allegations. Some charges go all the way back to the ’90s. The rapper went on trial before, on charges of 14 counts of child pornography. He was indicted in 2002 on the charges but was acquitted in 2008. That case revolved around a sex tape Kelly had allegedly made with an underage girl, but lawyers successfully argued the identity of the girl in the tape could not be confirmed. The jury deliberated for a few hours before acquitting him.

In hot water with the law yet again, Kelly sat down with Gayle King to defend himself against mounting allegations of sexual abuse.

“I’m very tired of all of the um, lies, I’ve been hearing things and seeing things on the blogs, and I’m just tired,” he told King on Wednesday morning.

Asked what lies about him bothered him most, Kelly said, “All of them” — before mentioning specifically “that little girls trapped in a basement, helicopters over my house, trying to rescue someone who doesn’t need to be rescued because they’re not in my house.”

Kelly denied doing anything illegal with women and said he has never had an intimate relationship with anyone under the age of 17.

“[I did] lots of things wrong when it comes to women, but I apologized in those relationships,” he said.

On the Lifetime docuseries that brought many of the allegations to the attention of the mainstream media, Kelly said, “Everybody says something bad about me. Nobody said something good. They was describing Lucifer. I’m not Lucifer. I’m a man. I made mistakes, but I’m not a devil.”

Kelly partly blamed social media and the attention on people for lies that are told.

He later called some of the allegations against him “stupid” — saying a celebrity of his stature and with his controversial past would have to be “stupid” to hold women against their will in his home.

“I have been assassinated. I have been buried alive from these lies,” he said.

Kelly then became more incensed — and began ranting directly to the camera.

“I don’t need to,” he said about holding women against their will. “Why would I? How stupid would it be for R. Kelly, with all that I’ve been through … to hold somebody. That’s stupid.”

“That’s stupid! Use your common sense,” he added. “Forget the blogs, forget how you feel about me. Hate me if you want to, love me if you want. But just use your common sense. How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I’ve been through — ‘Oh, right now I just think I need to be a monster and hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and don’t let them eat, don’t let them out, unless they need some shoes down the street from their uncle!'”

He eventually jumped out of his seat and angrily shouted at the camera, holding tears back as he spoke.

“Stop it. You don’t quit playing. Quit playing. I didn’t do this stuff! This is not me! I’m fighting for my f***ing life!” he yelled.

After a moment to calm down, Kelly said he needed “help.”

“I need help. This is the kind of help I need. I need somebody to help me not have a big heart. My heart is so big. People betray me and I keep on giving to them.”

Gayle King, during a break in the interview, insisted she never felt in danger, even though Kelly at one point was waving his fists and yelling.

In the second part of the interview, King asked Kelly about two young women — Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary, both 21 — who currently live with him.

“I love ’em and it’s almost like, they’re my girlfriends,” the rapper said. “We have a relationship. It’s real. I’ve known guys all my life who’ve had five or six women.”

Kelly then talked about the abuse he faced as a child and said he is currently fighting not just for his career, but for a relationship with his kids — he has three.

Kelly, 52, tried to clarify the perception that he likes young girls.

“I don’t look at [girls] much younger than me. I look at legal. One might be older than the other, one might be younger than the other. I just look at legal. There are older men that like younger women, there are younger women that like older men … I’m a man who likes all women.”

Kelly then talked about the abuse he faced as a child and said he is currently fighting not just for his career, but for a relationship with his kids — he has three.

Asked what he would do if his daughter said a man had done to her what Kelly has been accused of, the singer said, “I’d be up in that motherf***er’s face f***ing everything up … I would have to arrest myself after I did what I had to do.”

Greenberg was charged with assault, battery with serious bodily injury, and criminal threats, as well as a misdemeanor count of vandalism, according to the criminal complaint obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

Greenberg will be arraigned in court on Wednesday, the Alameda County District Attorney's office said.

Neither the suspected assailant nor Williams are students at Berkeley, but Campus Reform reported Greenberg, a software engineer according to Fox News, worked for the school as a lab assistant for three months in 2010 and was ""briefly"" a non-degree seeking student at the school.

The Feb. 19 attack on Williams was largely captured on camera. Williams, a field representative for the Leadership Institute, was accosted by two men while tabling on the campus's main plaza to recruit members for the right-wing student group Turning Point. According to Williams, the men took exception to a sign referencing the alleged hate crime hoax perpetrated by Jussie Smollett.

One man flipped over Williams's table, swore loudly at him, pushed him and eventually punched him in the face, leaving him with a black eye.

Given the charged political nature of the attack, Berkeley's response to the assault has been under the microscope. The campus is infamous among conservatives for intolerance to right-leaning views, but in a fiery statement on Saturday the administration pushed back on the notion it treated the case with anything less than the seriousness it deserved.

President Donald Trump invited Williams up to speak during his lengthy speech at CPAC on Saturday. Trump thanked him for taking a punch on behalf of conservatives, and Williams said he would continue to fight discrimination against conservatives on college campuses.

Trump also announced he would soon sign an executive order requiring universities and colleges receiving federal research money to support free speech.

Williams penned an op-ed for USA Today where he criticized Berkeley for allowing ""a culture of intolerance and violence towards conservatives to grow."""

“Until somebody can show me some proof otherwise, I’m going with him,” Queen Latifah told Yahoo News on the show ""Through Her Eyes."" “Because the guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, whose very kind and whose always cool and sweet, that’s the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof, which I haven’t seen yet, then, you know, I gotta go with him.”





Smollett alleged he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who yelled racist and homophobic comments at him, tied a rope around his neck, and poured bleach on him. He also said they yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.”

After a weeks-long investigation however, the Chicago Police Department announced it had substantial evidence showing Smollett staged the attack and paid two brothers, one who he worked with on the show “Empire,” to carry out a staged attack. Police said there was a check made out from Smollett to the brothers for $3,600.

Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, which could land him in jail for up to three years.

A number of prominent people in the media, Hollywood, and politics, including some Democrats running for president in 2020, jumped on Smollett's claim early on, saying the alleged attack was the equivalent of a “modern-day lynching.” As more details about the police investigation and media reports came out about a possible hoax, several people began walking back their prior comments and suggesting that all the evidence come out before making any conclusions."

Speaking to Sputnik, American media pundits and academics shared their opinions about the proposal, its timing and its possible implications.

At least four Democratic presidential hopefuls, namely Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Marianne Williamson and Julian Castro, have spoken in favour of some form of reparations to African Americans who were affected by slavery, according to The Washington Post.

""We must confront the dark history of slavery and government-sanctioned discrimination in this country that has had many consequences including undermining the ability of Black families to build wealth in America for generations,"" Warren told Reuters on 22 February.

People Demanding This Money Were Never Slaves

However, according to Ken Webster, a host of Pursuit of Happiness Radio on 950 in Houston, the Democrats just ""want to play on poor black voters' emotions, nothing more"".

""It's just a distraction,"" he believes. ""They have no intentions of giving the ancestors of slaves reparations. If they did, they'd propose a bill to support the idea. After all, they're both lawmakers"".

Webster highlighted that ""the people demanding this money were never slaves and the people they expect to pay the reparations tab were never slave owners"".

According to the radio host, ""it's not about racism, it's about the perception of racism"": ""If the Jussie Smollett controversy has taught us anything, it's that America's leftist media and voter block want racism to be a bigger issue than it actually should be. Nobody is being oppressed, but feeling like you're oppressed is as popular an opinion as ever"".

He presumed that ""the only reason we're hearing discussion of reparations is because some white liberal political consultant told the Democrat candidates they're all unpopular with black people"".

""Of course, not every black person wants reparations,"" Webster noted.

With Its $22 Trillion Debt US Can't Afford Reparations For Slavery

Dr Judd Patton, professor emeritus of economics at Bellevue University, highlighted that the reparations issue is just part of a broader agenda advocated by the Democrats.

""The Green New Deal, reparations, abortion even at the point of birth, Medicare for all, free college tuition etc., is appealing to young people like the millennials — they love free things from the government,"" he explained.

The professor elaborated that ""as conservatives explain the costs and implications of the Democratic agenda, more and more voters, especially taxpayers, will turn against this socialist agenda"".

""It will be seen as radical and contrary the Constitutional principles and values of our Founders,"" he said. ""Expect current popularity to collapse"".

Reparations for slavery may impose an enormous burden on the US economy. According to Social Science Quarterly, they could cost between $5.9 trillion and $14.2 trillion.

""It's taken 228 years to generate a national debt of $22 trillion, and it is a threat to the future health of our nation. Socialists have no sense of economic proportion and perspective of what they are imposing,"" Dr. Patton said.

Dr. Mark Thornton, a senior fellow at the Mises Institute, echoes Patton: ""No country can afford such expensive programmes, especially one that is already $22 trillion in debt with much more to come in the ensuing decades. We would have to cut spending by $20 trillion over the next 20 years just to prevent bankruptcy"".

Two Conditions for Eligibility for Black Reparations

In contrast, William A. Darity, a professor of African and African American studies in the Sanford School of Public Policy, thinks the idea voiced by the Democratic presidential candidates is a step in the right direction if implemented in a reasonable way.

In his writings dating from the early 2000s, the professor argued that ""there should be two conditions for eligibility for black reparations in the United States"".

First, ""an individual must demonstrate that they have at least on ancestor who was enslaved in the United States.""

Second, ""an individual must show that at least ten years before the enactment of a reparations program they self-identified on a legal document as black, negro, Afro/African American or coloured.""

According to Darity, ""reparations are to be paid to black descendants of persons enslaved in the United States for three cumulative injustices: slavery, the Jim Crow regime or legal segregation, and ongoing racism manifest in the enormous racial wealth gap, wage discrimination, police lynchings and mass incarceration"".

He specified that ""the program will not apply to more recent immigrants who should make suitable reparations claims on the nations that colonised and/or conducted slavery in their countries of origin"".

""A strong example is the Caribbean Reparations Commission"", the professor emphasised. ""The funds can be distributed in multiple ways that I have called a 'portfolio' of reparations"".

The academic elaborated that the enactment of a reparations programme ""will require Congressional action"", adding that he doubted that the initiative would ""significantly increase tensions"".

Meanwhile, Gallup's recent poll shows that only 18 percent of African Americans are satisfied with the way blacks are treated in the US, while ""over half of blacks believe that blacks are treated less favourably than whites in dealing with the police, in stores and malls, and on the job"".

The analytics and advisory company noted that about two-thirds of African Americans believe that the US government should play a major role in improving the social and economic positions of blacks.

Previously, a 2016 Marist poll indicated that 58 per cent of African Americans backed the idea for reparations for descendants of slaves.

At the Cut’s How I Get It Done Day on Monday, March 4, Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts spoke about her recent interviews with Jussie Smollett and Selma Blair. It was the first time Blair spoke publicly about her multiple sclerosis since being diagnosed last year.

“I didn’t know what to expect,” Roberts said of meeting with Blair. “They had me go upstairs because we were going to do the walk-and-talk before we did the interview because of her strength. So I go upstairs to her room and she is together. That’s just what I said to her, she looked phenomenal. And then she spoke” — Blair was going through an MS flare-up that affected her speech during the interview — “and I didn’t want my, I didn’t know that she had that condition where it was very difficult for her to speak, but I made sure that my eyes didn’t look at her like I’m sure people do when they see somebody or hear somebody [like that]. I know not to treat people differently. And she told me that that meant a lot to her. I just started talking to her like a girlfriend.”

.@SelmaBlair on her MS diagnosis, “I was a little scared of talking.” https://t.co/W1vUNMab63 pic.twitter.com/XvWdGO30Ow — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 26, 2019

Blair said she had struggled with health problems since her son was born in 2011, and only recently realized she had “aggressive MS” because doctors initially didn’t take her pain seriously. “I was a little scared of talking [in this GMA interview,] and even my neurologist said no, this will bring a lot of awareness because no one has the energy to talk when they’re in a flare-up,” Blair said. “But I do, because I love a camera.”

Roberts said she loved Blair’s sense of humor throughout the interview. “I think she was so free in talking because she had she had seen my story, and she saw how difficult but how important it was for me to share as much as I could about my breast cancer and then my blood cancer disorder,” Roberts said. “It was just an easy, easy conversation to have with her. I’m so taken aback, and so grateful. I can’t remember the last time I did an interview that received so much positive attention, positive remarks. The MS community that has come out and rallied and is so incredibly grateful to her.”

At the end of the interview, Blair said her doctor predicted she would have 90 percent of her abilities back within a year, and she offered to interview with Roberts again. “I want to document the year,” Roberts told Bugbee. “I want people to be able to see the highs and the lows.”

Roberts called her interview with Smollett a “no-win situation” where she aimed to remain “neutral.”

“I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man,” she said. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.’” Two days after her interview with the Empire actor, shortly after it aired, two Nigerian brothers alleged they were paid by Smollett to stage the attack.

Roberts said her team did the best they could given the information they had at the time, thinking Smollett was a victim when they interviewed him. “I pride myself in being fair,” she said. “There’s so many people who do not come forward because others are not believed. I don’t know how this is all going to end. We still talk to the [Chicago] police superintendent.”

But we all know how the American justice system works, right?

One is innocent until one is proven guilty.

This said, things do not look good for the Empire actor, especially not in the court of public opinion.

As you are very likely aware of by now, Smollett claimed several weeks ago that he was attacked on the streets of Chicago early on the morning of January 29.

He said two white men did it... and that they yelled racial and homophobic epithets at him... and that the placed a rope around his neck... and poured bleach all over him... and taunted him about living in ""MAGA country.""

According to the Chicago Police Department, however, Smollett staged his own attack and lied to everyone about all these details.

After lots of chatter about such an orchestration, Smollett was arrested for falsifying a police report last month.

The evidence against Smollett looks pretty strong, and there's nearly no one on record who will take his side at this point.

Except for Queen Latifah.

Speaking to Zainab Salbi, host of the Yahoo News show ""Through Her Eyes,"" the rapper/actres initially seemed hesitant to talk about the situation.

The two had previously worked together on an Empire/Star crossover episode and Latifah didn't want to delve into such a sensitive topic.

""I'm not about to discuss Jussie Smollett,"" Latifah said at first, prior to then discussing him:

""Somebody can show me some proof, otherwise I'm going with him because the guy I've seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who's very kind and who's always been cool and sweet.

""And that's just the guy I know.""

This is certainly a fair assessment of a bizarre situation.

""Until I can see some definitive proof -- which I haven't seen yet -- then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise,"" the Queen added.

The police have said they have phone records that prove Smollett talked to the supposed assaiants right before the ""crime"" was committed.

They also say these assailants worked as extras on Empire and were close with Smollett, shooting down his assertaion that he was assaulted by two random white dudes.

When Salbi asked whether we should look at the whole scandal through a racial justice ""lens,"" Latifah replied:

""Well I think you always would have to. You should always be aware of that regardless...

""This whole thing started off [with] him allegedly being attacked by some guys -- who appeared to be white guys -- wearing hats that said 'Make America Great Again' and yelled epithets at him and said, 'This is MAGA country.'""

She concluded:

""So the whole thing started off being like that.

""So how could you not take that into account, but everything that's happened since then has been, who knows what it is. I don't even know what to make of it. All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.""

We agree.

But this seems very hard to imagine at this point.

Smollett turned himself in and was booked by Chicago PD on February 21 under a felony charge for filing a false police report.

He faces three years in jail and was released on $100,000 bond.

Chicago police are maintaining they believe Smollett orchestrated the attack with two Nigerian brothers, who he had also hired as his personal trainers."

We previously reported, in January, the ‘Empire’ actor reported to police that he had been attacked by two men that poured an unknown substance on his body and placed a noose around his neck.

As investigators searched for the truth, they arrested two men in connection with the alleged crime–Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo– who were quickly released after police obtained information that claimed Jussie staged the attack.

Jussie has since been indicted on charges of filing a false police report and released on bond. Now Oscar winning actress Queen Latifah is speaking out in defense of the 37-year-old, who she knows closely.

“Until somebody can show me some proof otherwise, I’m going with him,” Queen told Yahoo News on their series, “Through Her Eyes.”

“Cause the guy I’ve seen has always seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet. And that’s just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof — which I haven’t seen yet — then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.”

Jussie is set to return to. court on March 14th to face felony charges of disorderly conduct for claiming he was attacked on January 29th.

A statement his camp read during the bail hearing read:

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”"

WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP)—Mayor John Duran announced Monday that he will resign the largely ceremonial position for health reasons amid sexual harassment allegations.

Duran said he will relinquish the title—which is rotated annually among City Council members—with two months to go but will remain on the council, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Duran was recently hospitalized for a week with blood clots and in a Facebook post cited health issues for his decision to pass the gavel to Mayor pro tem John D'Amico.

""I continue to work with my doctors to try and get my blood and body in the right balance. I am supposed to slow down to half speed and rest for the next 30 days,'' Duran said in the post, adding that he will ""be back as feisty as ever very soon.''

Duran's council term expires in November 2020.

The other council members cannot oust him but they were scheduled to meet Monday to consider other options, which could include formally stripping Duran of the mayor's title, censuring him and denying him expense reimbursements for city-related business, City Attorney Michael Jenkins told the Times.

Protesters have been demanding Duran's ouster in the wake of sexual harassment allegations.

Three current or former members of the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles have alleged that Duran made crude sexual remarks or touched them inappropriately and three years ago the city paid $500,000 to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Duran's former council deputy.

Duran also has faced criticism for his past work as an attorney for Ed Buck, a prominent Democratic donor who is well-known in LGBTQ political circles. Authorities are investigating the January death of a man at Buck's West Hollywood home, which followed the death of another man there in 2017 from a drug overdose.

Buck's current attorney has said the January death also was an accidental drug overdose.

Bid to fortify Utah hate-crimes law passes first Senate vote

By LINDSAY WHITEHURST

Associated Press

SALT LAKE CITY (AP)—A bid to strengthen the state's hate-crimes law passed its first vote on Monday following an occasionally emotional debate over the long-stalled idea that's been gaining steam since the beating of a Latino man in Salt Lake City.

The state has reached a tipping point on the issue, said Republican sponsor Sen. Daniel Thatcher.

""I know how many people are counting on us to stand up and make the hard decision and do the right thing,'' he said.

His measure would allow longer sentences for people convicted of targeting someone because of their sexual orientation, race, religion or other factors. The Senate passed the bill, 19-9.

Supporters argued it would protect civil rights and be an important tool in prosecuting crimes that can strike fear through entire communities.

Opponents, though, worry the measure goes too far in singling out certain groups for protections and stiffer penalties wouldn't solve the problem.

""The reality is, when we're creating protected classes we pick and choose,'' said Republican Sen. Jake Anderegg. A bid to add protections for people targeted because of their political beliefs was voted down, despite lawmakers' concern about recent pushback against conservatives in the U.S.

If the measure passes a second Senate vote it will go to the House of Representatives.

Utah's current hate-crime law doesn't protect specific groups and prosecutors have said it's essentially unusable.

The bill to strengthen it stalled in 2016, and supporters said its prospects were hurt when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints urged lawmakers, many of whom are members, not to upset a balance between religious and LGBT rights.

Church officials clarified this year that they do not oppose the legislation.

A groundswell of support for the idea picked up speed after the November 2018 beating of a Latino man in Salt Lake City who authorities have said was targeted by an attacker who said he wanted to ""kill Mexicans.''

Alan Dale Covington could not be charged with a hate crime in state court even though he told police he assaulted a father and son with a 3-foot (91-centimeter) metal pole because they were from Mexico, according to court documents. He was instead charged in federal court in connection with a crime that left one man with serious head wounds. His attorney has not returned messages seeking comment.

Democratic Sen. Luz Escamilla said attacks like that rippled through her community.

""I had to explain to my children that they were safe. The irony is I didn't feel safe myself,'' she said.

In a separate incident two weeks ago, a video showing a man in Salt Lake City punching a stranger allegedly because he was gay gained widespread attention online.

Gay teen shunned by parents starts college fund for others

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP)—A Florida teen who raised tens of thousands of dollars for college after his parents ostracized him for being gay now wants to pay it forward.

Seth Owen's story was widely shared after his biology teacher took to the crowdfunding site GoFundMe that raised $140,000. He also got a $25,000 check on Ellen DeGeneres' TV talk show.

Georgetown University offered the Jacksonville valedictorian a full-ride scholarship, and he told WTLV he used the windfall to start a nonprofit group to help other teenagers in similar circumstances.

The organization Unbroken Horizons Scholarship Foundation will be awarding three scholarships this summer.

Owen's parents kicked him out a year ago following disagreements over his sexuality and an ultimatum: attend their Southern Baptist church or leave.

Correction: Gay Rights Activist-Fire story

JACKSON, Mich. (AP)—In a story Feb. 26 about a Michigan transgender, gay rights activist charged with arson, The Associated Press reported erroneously that police said the man tried to fabricate a hate crime by setting his home on fire. The FBI initially investigated the arson as a possible hate crime but police have not provided a motive.

A corrected version of the story is below:

Gay rights activist accused of setting own home on fire

Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist set his own home on fire

JACKSON, Mich. (AP)—Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist charged with arson set his home on fire in an incident initially investigated by the FBI as a possible hate crime, but the man's attorney is questioning the evidence.

Attorney Daniel Barnett said the evidence is circumstantial and doesn't provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Nikki Joly set the August 2017 fire that killed five pets at his home in Jackson.

The 54-year-old Joly was charged last year with first-degree arson. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court, The Detroit News reported.

""We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,'' Elmer Hitt, Jackson's director of police and fire services, said Monday. ""We investigated it over what probably was a year's time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.''

MLive.com obtained the arson investigation report that says gas station surveillance video shows Joly buying gasoline the day of the fire and traces of gasoline were found on his clothes. Phone records and witness statements show Joly was home around the time the fire was set, the report said.

""The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being seen,'' police detective Aaron Grove wrote in the report.

Hitt declined to provide a potential motive for the arson. Barnett said the lack of motive causes doubt in the prosecutor's case.

""It doesn't make sense,'' Barnett said. ""(Joly) was citizen of the year.''

A local newspaper selected Joly as Jackson's citizen of the year in 2018. Joly helped open the city's first gay community center, organized its first gay pride festival and helped pass a nondiscrimination ordinance.

Chicago police last week charged the black and gay ""Empire'' actor Jussie Smollett with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting a racist and homophobic attack.

Proposed ban on LGBT conversion therapy getting pushback

By LINDSAY WHITEHURST

Associated Press

SALT LAKE CITY (AP)—A proposal to ban gay conversion therapy for minors encountered pushback in conservative Utah on Friday as state lawmakers questioned whether it's too restrictive for therapists talking about sexual orientation with young clients.

Supporters of the measure said it allows discussion about sexuality, as long as there's no attempt to change orientation or gender identity. Conversion therapy has a history in Utah, including the use of now-outdated physical techniques like electroshock therapy, and is associated with higher rates of depression and suicide attempts, supporters said.á

""You provide neutral treatment, that's all. It's not a therapist's role to pass judgment,'' said Cliff Rosky, a University of Utah professor who helped draft the plan, which is similar to bans passed in 15 other states and the District of Columbia.

Still, lawmakers had concerns, and Republican Rep. Karianne Lisonbee said she wanted to be cautious with the proposal that's drawn opposition from some Utah therapists.

""It is not a small step for us to take to say this speech, which is still protected even though it's professional speech, is not allowed,'' Republican Rep. Brady Brammer said.

A panel of lawmakers discussed the proposal but did not vote on it Friday, though Republican sponsor Rep. Craig Hall expected it to be heard again shortly.

Counselor Joan Landes is opposed to the bill and on Friday wore a piece of tape over her mouth with the word ""silenced.'' She deals with a number of clients who are ""unhappy with some aspect of their same-sex attraction,'' and she's afraid that liability concerns would keep her from taking those clients, she said.

""What about the kids who want to make changes and we have to say, `Sorry, it's hopeless.'?'' Landes said.

Other therapists saw it differently.

Lisa Tensmeyer Hansen said she supports the ban and has seen people suffering after undergoing verbal conversion therapy. She helps clients explore their feelings about sexuality and how it affects their lives, and teaches skills to be healthy ""without talking about what can or can't be changed,'' she said.

Supporters of the measure pushed back against Brammer's proposal to remove the restrictions on verbal therapy and limit the ban to physical techniques. ""Words are just as damaging to children as more physical methods,'' Rosky said.

The proposal is sponsored by two GOP lawmakers and has been gaining momentum since the influential Mormon church said it would not oppose it. Gov. Gary Herbert has also endorsed it, Hall said.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has taken a welcoming stance to the LGBT community in recent years, though the faith remains opposed to marriage and sexual relations between people of the same gender. About two-thirds of residents and a large majority of lawmakers are members.

The measure would apply to state-licensed therapists, not religious leaders or parents, and would allow people to file a complaint against someone practicing conversion therapy.

Woman says church fired her over same-sex relationship

CHAPIN, S.C. (AP)—A South Carolina woman says she was fired from her role as a teacher at a Baptist child development center for her same-sex relationship.

The State reported Wednesday that Skye Moore was fired last week for a ""conflict of interest'' she says Chapin Baptist Church Pastor Michael Hull explained was her relationship. She says she has been with her fiancee for three years and the relationship wasn't secret from her supervisors or the pastor.

Several parents told the newspaper they knew about Moore's relationship and it wasn't a problem as she was a great and particularly attentive teacher. They also questioned why Moore was fired now, months after Hull started as pastor and five years after she started at the center.

The newspaper says Hull declined to comment.

Posthumous memoir by gay rights pioneer due in October

NEW YORK (AP)—A posthumous memoir by gay rights pioneer Edie Windsor will be released in October.

Windsor's ""A Wild and Precious Life'' will draw upon her uncompleted manuscript and other personal papers, St. Martin's Press announced Thursday. The book was finished by Joshua Lyon, with cooperation from her spouse, Judith Kasen-Windsor. ""A Wild and Precious Life'' will include everything from her childhood to her coming out as a lesbian to the 2013 Supreme Court ruling she helped bring about that led to same-sex marriage nationwide.

Windsor, who died in 2017, challenged a federal law that would have only granted her an inheritance tax break if she married a man. She was facing a big tax bill after the death of her first wife, Thea Spyer, whom she had married in Canada.

The New Face of Tyranny

The left's tack toward traditional redistributive communism recalls 1960s New Left movement

Commentary

Young lawmakers are advancing old ideas. A shift to an old-style left—traditionally Marxist with modern garb—has perhaps been in motion for decades. Now, the movement has accelerated.

Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has repeatedly demonstrated a Soviet concept of equality. Her successful disruption of the Amazon HQ2 proposal in New York can best be interpreted as an attack against prosperity as personified by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos—a vilification of the successful and a desire to penalize the wealthy at the expense of the masses.

Who cares about those thousands of jobs that Amazon’s presence would have generated—the small businesses, bodegas, barbershops, dry cleaners, and the like—that now will never come into being? This is apart from those who would have been employed directly by Amazon, but who will now be employed in another congressperson’s district.

To the Marxist lawmaker, what really matters is the “greater good,” or in Ocasio-Cortez’s case, principles unhampered by a lack of understanding of the basic economic concepts involved, as exemplified by her statements concerning alternate uses for the $3 billion that Amazon would have received in tax breaks.

The new New Left’s move toward traditional redistributive communism is evidenced by the confiscatory tax rates proposed by Ocasio-Cortez and other young, recently elected lawmakers, such as Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). The ultimate objective is to drag down those who have achieved and earned the rewards that are the fruits of initiative and hard work, as if they were ill-gotten gains.

Are there wealthy individuals who have exploited others? No doubt. However, the best tool for righting those wrongs is a scalpel, not a machete.

Abuse of the system for truly unfair gain should target those who are, in fact, abusers. Expropriating the profits of all those who are successful is indicative not of a desire to limit economic exploitation, but rather of an intent to drag all who are successful down to the lowest common denominator, so that all may “equally” share the same squalor, to create a classless society. Except, of course, for the lawmakers, who will require some degree of privilege to create an environment that facilitates the exercise of their decision-making on our behalf.

The result: a truly classless society. And just as in Soviet Russia, communist China, and “socialist paradise” Cuba, there will be those who are lower-classless, others who are middle-classless, and the commissars, who will be upper-classless.

A chilling example of the Soviet-style manner of conducting a public hearing occurred during the Feb. 13 questioning of the U.S. special envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams. As reported by Gideon Resnick in the Daily Beast, Omar stated during the congressional hearing, reading from notes:

“In 1991, you pleaded guilty to two counts of withholding information from Congress regarding your involvement in the Iran-Contra affair, for which you were later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush. I fail to understand why members of this committee, or the American people, should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful.”

Abrams quickly replied, “If I could respond to that,” at which point, Omar shot back, “That wasn’t a question.”

The testy exchange ended after some more back and forth. “Members of this committee can’t attack a witness who is not permitted to reply,” Abrams said.

As for the Soviet police state? The predawn knock at the door by the KGB could never happen here, of course. Just ask Paul Manafort and Roger Stone.

Rise of Anti-Semitism

The rise of Soviet-style anti-Semitism seems similar to that seen in the days of Vladimir Lenin, Josef Stalin, and Nikita Khrushchev. In Russia, the evolution was from Jewish philosophical leaders at the forefront of the new Soviet state—like Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky—to institutionalized anti-Semitism. Witness the victimization of Anatoly Shcharansky and his long prison term before being released to immigrate to Israel.

Now, the left wing of the Democratic Party has commenced its evolution toward a new anti-Semitism, informed as well by radical Islamic ideology combined with classical Marxist philosophy.

Anti-Semitic leaders have co-opted the women’s movement, with leaders such as Tamika Mallory openly supporting Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. In the House of Representatives, Omar does little to hide her beliefs, as seen in her well-publicized tweets: “Israel has hypnotized the world,” “It’s all about the Benjamins,” and more. As reported in The Times of Israel on Jan. 19, the Simon Wiesenthal Center denounced both Omar and fellow newly elected Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) for repeated “anti-Israel and anti-Semitic statements.”

Tolerance toward anti-Jewish violence is on the rise. The Jerusalem Post on Jan. 29 documented several assaults on identifiably Jewish victims—violent assaults and unprovoked beatings that received virtually no domestic media coverage. However, on the date of a most violent anti-Semitic attack, an allegedly self-orchestrated “homophobic and racist” assault on actor Jussie Smollett received nationwide media coverage, and immediate tweets from Hollywood celebrities and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemning the “attack.”

Presidential aspirants Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Corey Booker of New Jersey—both of whom have been silent on anti-Semitic rhetoric and incidents—issued near-identical responses, with Booker tweeting that “[t]he vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe.”

No accusations of lynching are voiced when the victims are merely Jewish.

Not long ago, institutionalized anti-Semitism in the United States was unimaginable, as was a shift toward the tyranny of the left. When I graduated from law school as a young Jewish attorney, I asked my father if I should have my diploma mounted on a wooden plaque. He advised against it, saying I should be prepared for the day when I would need to stick it in my back pocket for a quick departure. Now, I know just how wise his advice was.

With the old Soviet-style tyranny, power was retained by prohibiting individuals from crossing borders in an outward direction. In the new tyranny, unlike the Soviet and Cuban practices, power is retained by refusing to prevent any individuals from crossing the borders inward. The more who do manage to enter, the larger the power base for the socialist elite. But have no doubt, once the left has successfully reduced the standard of living for the masses, the barriers to exodus will be raised. Then, to consolidate their power, they will have to evolve along traditional communist lines and prevent free emigration.

For those with lingering doubts about the tectonic shift this country is undergoing, the Green New Deal is revelatory. That it could be taken seriously by lawmakers wouldn’t have been a surprise to George Orwell—his only error was one of timing, because he expected the transformation to have been completed by 1984.

This benignly named Green New Deal is summarized this way by CNN (not a right-wing media outlet) analyst Zachary Wolf: “What was entered as official legislative language on Capitol Hill declares the government should take a stronger position on everything from cutting carbon emissions, to giving every American a job, to working with family farmers to retrofitting every building in the country.”

Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas warned: “As nightfall does not come all at once, neither does oppression. In both instances, there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged. And it is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the air—however slight—lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness.”

It’s time to turn on the light.

Officials: Man infected with measles violated his quarantine with help from wife to get to gym | FOX6Now.com

BROOKFIELD — A Brookfield couple faces criminal charges after prosecutors said they knowingly may have exposed the public to measles. Prosecutors said one man’s desire to work out — may have put people at risk. Charges were filed against the man and woman on March 1, 2019. A criminal complaint said on May 1, 2018, a Waukesha County sheriff’s deputy pulled over Christine Bennett, 58, along Bluemound Road. In the passenger seat of the vehicle was her husband, Jeffery Murawski, 57, who was allegedly infected with measles. Documents showed officials with the Waukesha County Health Department ordered Murawski to stay at his home 24 hours a day until he was deemed non-contagious. Instead, prosecutors said he admitted “to going inside Gold’s Gym to work out,” but was only there a few minutes because “he felt very guilty.”

A bucket of scum spouting an obviously bogus tale of a “hate crime” like Jussie Smollett is unblinkingly relayed to the world at large by the media without an “alleged” in sight.

A sixteen year old boy smiling at a lying, deranged commie agitator is peddled as a tale of an Indian being the obvious victim of a “hate crime,” without an “alleged” in sight.

A supreme court nominee is smeared in the most awful and dishonest way in the press, without an “alleged” in sight.

But here, when some witheringly selfish and entitled piece of shit is diagnosed and put into quarantine by the health department, (a group with the medical ability to make such diagnoses) decides to go out and infect the world with his highly contagious disease, said disease is presented as being only “alleged.”

No, you fucking morons. His measles are no more “alleged” than will be the crimes of Jussie Smollett after he is tried and found guilty."

Stan loves Eminem. Like, really, really loves Eminem: we’re talking inspirational pictures blu-tacked to his mirror, basement full of press cuttings, and incredibly creepy fan letters written in the ominous glow of a flickering light.

Unfortunately, the letters never make it to the rapper, and Stan’s frustration at being ignored grows. In a last ditch attempt to get his hero’s attention, Stan locks his pregnant girlfriend in the trunk of his car and drives off a bridge. By the time Eminem finally responds, it’s all too late.

The track gave us a new word to describe an overzealous, obsessive fan in the pop culture sphere: a ‘stan’.

Rihanna effortlessly gliding over a grill while wearing stilettos, stolen wine glass in hand? We stan! Beyonce and Jay-Z accepting their International Group award in front of a portrait of Meghan Markle at the BRITs? Very stannable. Kacey Musgraves performing ‘High Horse’, atop a literal horse? Proud to announce that we stan!

And most of the time, stanning is harmless. It’s old-fashioned fandom for the internet age. But often, stanning manifests as a kind of blind, unquestioning devotion – the kind of thing that leads the BTS Army to talk about their idols like they’re gods on earth who can’t be criticised. Ask Capital FM’s Roman Kemp, who was reported to OFCOM for race discrimination for calling the South Korean sensations’s music ‘noise’. Few journalists here at NME or elsewhere have escaped a stan pile-on; these days, it’s an occupational hazard.

At its worst, it can lead to threatening behaviour, mob-handed bullying and it can even turn on the object of affection.

Back when ‘Stan’ came out, in order to strike up a conversation with an artist you’d need to loiter outside after a show, or chance a lucky meeting. It was possible to track your fave’s movements with a bit of educated snooping or – in the case of acts like Bros – camping outside their mum’s house, but the gap between artist and listener was far wider before the advent of social media.

These days, it’s possible to keep up with what Troye Sivan’s up to right now with a quick glance at his Insta Story. Mega-stars, even of Ariana Grande level, have been known to reply to fans’ tweets. When Rihanna quietly direct messaged a young gay fan in 2016, he came out to a friend, buoyed by her support. “Stanning for you was the best decision I’ve ever done,” the fan said in a message. “I’m so proud of you,” Rihanna replied.

On the downside, there is the damaging expectation that stars should be fully accessible, 24-seven. Stepping away from the spotlight is near impossible when fans upload stealthy phone snaps wherever you go.

”The internet is pivotal, and has amplified the whole ‘queueing outside venues for hours’ culture that’s been about since the time of The Beatles and Elvis,” says NME pop columnist Douglas Greenwood. “The difference now is that access is immediate, and stans can question their favourite artist’s every move.

“A great example is Marina [and The Diamonds],” Douglas points out. “Here was an artist who chose to step back from making music for three years and live her life like a normal person for a bit, but whenever she chose to upload a photo to Instagram, doing something that wasn’t “being in the studio”, she was met with fans commenting, pressuring her to drop new music. Social media gives artists nowhere to hide, which probably explains why so many of them have forgone the concept of album cycles and ‘eras’ to be constantly present instead. The thirst is so visible, and if you flop, everybody knows about it. The stakes are painfully high.”

The perceived accessibility of musicians in the internet age has even placed certain artists in an unique new position, having to call out their own fans when they go too far. After her ex-boyfriend Pete Davidson spoke out about the online bullying he had faced since their break-up, Ariana Grande stepped in and urged stans to stop sending abusive messages.

“I feel I need to remind my fans to please be gentler with others,” she said on Instagram. “I really don’t endorse anything but forgiveness and positivity. I care deeply about Pete and his health. I’m asking you to please be gentler with others, even on the internet.”

“I need to remind my fans to please be gentler with others. I really don’t endorse anything but forgiveness and positivity”

Bebe Rexha, meanwhile had to call off some overzealous stans after they rushed to defend her… from her own dad. He’d texted Rexha saying that her video for ‘Last Hurrah’ makes him feel “sick” due to its more risqué scenes. After the the singer jokingly posted a screen grab of their conversation, a portion of fans mounted a fightback and things quickly got personal. “Don’t say mean things about my dad, please,” she later wrote. “I should have never posted that screenshot. I’m disappointed in myself”.

It’s not only artists who can suffer from the lack of hiding places left by online life. Frequently, stans aren’t just concerned with what their favourite artist is up to, but what their rivals are up to, too.

Pitting stars against peers is another pastime that has become far easier with the help of social media; log onto Twitter on any given day, and you’ll spot Cardi B stans having a pop at Nicki Minaj, or Swifties (Taylor Swift super-fans) sending snake emojis en masse to Kim Kardashian.

Any artist who ‘slights’ another star faces a potential pile-on, with similar amounts of vitriol reserved for journalists, other people on twitter, fans of rival stars, and anyone else who dares to cross a stanned musician.

In some circumstances, stans go to extreme lengths to defend their favourite artists from any form of criticism whatsoever, even when they face incredibly serious allegations.

In response to Leaving Neverland, a new documentary about Michael Jackson which outlines disturbing allegations of child sex abuse, and which airs on Channel 4 tonight, the backlash from superfans is deafeningly loud.

Some stans argue that the whole conversation is a disgrace since Jackson is dead and unable to defend himself, ignoring his alleged victims’ right to justice, along with the plain fact that Jackson defended himself plenty during his lifetime.

Others are taking shots at the documentary’s director Dan Reed, accusing him of profiting off somebody they say is an innocent man and questioning his motives. Many are also attempting to smear the two men who have accused Jackson. Bizarrely, many of them are doing this by referencing the case of Jussie Smollett (who was arrested for staging his own assault) as if the actions of one person can invalidate the words and experiences of genuine survivors. Defending an artist from all criticism, at whatever cost isn’t fandom. It’s a dangerous path to go down.

While it is true that people are innocent until proven guilty in the eyes of the law, it is also an unavoidable fact that systematic failures in the justice system can make securing a conviction against violent and abusive men incredibly difficult, and that it is important to believe and support survivors when they are brave enough to speak out against powerful figures in music. This particular logic also fails to stand up when you consider the stans still protesting the innocence of Chris Brown and 6ix9ine, who have been found guilty of various crimes by a court.

Occasionally, stan pile-ons also become as toxic as the behaviour that’s being defended; when I questioned Eminem’s frequent use of the word “faggot” in an article last year, hundreds of stans disagreed – as they’re entitled to.

Lots of them called me a snowflake, and to be fair to them all, I am a very sensitive little petal (shout out to Fairy Snow Non-Bio for being kind to my delicate skin). Then there were the people telling me to “cry harder, faggot” and suggesting I kill myself.

Though Eminem later apologised for using the slur on his 2018 album ‘Kamikaze’, he’s been throwing around the f-bomb for years. When called out, some stans defend their word choices by citing freedom of speech, or the idea that a slur is “just a word”. Others send torrents of racist or homophobic abuse.

NME journalist Leonie Cooper remembers one chaotic weekend when she came under attack from superfans after she wrote a Guardian piece about Avril Lavigne posing naked with a guitar. In her op-ed, she questioned why nudity is often used as a marketing tool in the industry. There was outcry from a selection of Avril stans who disagreed with the piece, but ironically, a lot of abuse Leonie received took on a shockingly misogynic and personal tone.

Leonie says she originally wrote the piece with the intention of “laying into a music industry that still treats women in a drastically different way to men”. Some of the responses only amplified this idea.

“The abuse directed at me was horribly misogynistic – which was deeply ironic considering the fact that the whole gist of the piece was rooted in feminism,” Leonie says. “The fact that I was accused of not being a feminist for writing it made it even clearer that people hadn’t read it properly and were just jumping the gun in order to seem like they, above all the others, were the most deeply committed fan. Whoever let the truth get in the way of a good bit of a fake outrage, eh?”

“I really think that it comes down to the anonymity that you can get with online social media,” reckons 1975 stan Mia, who followed her favourite band around the UK on their recent tour. She camped outside the band’s Birmingham show, and even starred in the band’s video for ‘TOOTIME…’.

As a result of her cameo, other fans have bought her drinks before in Wetherspoons, and Mia says she has made new friends from following the band. She’s found the community of 1975 stans to be largely inclusive, but she recognises how social media can help things get out of hand.

“Of course, people are going to be protective of their favourite bands, but I think sometimes using the internet in the wrong way accentuates the divide,” Mia says. “People think they can do things that they wouldn’t necessarily do in person. I also think it’s very easy to get influenced. More people are susceptible to getting involved in this kind of behaviour. The internet can be amazing but when it’s used wrongly it can really cause pain to others.”

At the beginning of this year, musician Amanda Palmer took the unusual step of meeting up with a person who posted negative things about her on Twitter, later describing it as “one of the hardest and best things I’ve done with my time for a while”.

Meeting for the first time on the Conversations With People Who Hate Me Podcast, Palmer spoke to a woman identified only as Coleen, who had previously tweeted “I’m not sure I hate any celebrity the way I hate Amanda Palmer”

Palmer asked Coleen if she might’ve reconsidered sending the tweet “if you could’ve imagined me on the other side of the computer reading it the next day?”

The pair talked for an hour in total, with Coleen admitting that she hadn’t considered the real-life repercussions her words could have. “Honestly, I kinda wanna cry right now,” she told Palmer. “Because [in the tweet] I’m telling somebody, who’s also a human being, ‘here’s a horrible thing I said about you.’”

Though the word ‘stan’ wasn’t added to the Oxford English Dictionary until 2017, the concept of the obsessive fan is nothing new. From The Beatles to The Osmonds to Bros, Take That, Michael Jackson and countless more, fans have been chasing stars around hotel corridors and camping outside venues since forever.

Ian Connick, who has been following his hero Bruce Springsteen since 1981, might not describe himself as a stan per se, but he’s still gone to some pretty impressive lengths to see The Boss live. “I’ve seen him 24 times now,” says Ian. “I still have the ticket for my first show, at Wembley Arena, which cost me £6.00! Unfortunately, that still makes me an amateur compared to some of the people you hear about.”

“As much as it breeds a toxic culture, and one that victimises women so hideously, stan culture also brings people together”

– Douglas Greenwood

Devotion aside, Ian’s adamant that he would never want to meet or speak with his idol. “While I would love to be his best friend, they always say never meet your heroes. I think I would be absolutely terrified, and doubtless come out with some gibberish that would leave him thinking I’m an idiot,” he says bluntly.

“I’m beginning to think the internet makes it easier not to be nice,” reckons Springsteen fan Ian. “It’s very easy to hide behind an alias and say some pretty horrible things about people who simply hold different views from your own. It has certainly changed the world, but not always for the better.”

But really, stan culture is fan culture and it all comes down to loving music – not a bad thing in itself. It’s fun to obsess over your faves, and to spar with rival fans, but the limits should be common sense. Often, caught up in the moment, it can be difficult to know where the line is; perhaps it’s harder to visualise the real life consequences of your words when you’re flinging them into a digital black hole.

“As much as it breeds a toxic culture, and one that victimises women so hideously, stan culture also brings people together,” Douglas Greenwood says. “The pop women heavyweights are where all the ugliness and pettiness lies: Gaga, Katy Perry, Ari and Nicki stans are dangerous, and you dare cross them.”

And it’s true that a particularly toxic stan culture can exist around women. Often, adoration of women in pop can take on nasty misogynistic undertones, damning cries of “flop!” following every single misstep. Some stans rejoice the triumph of one female artist by gleefully celebrating another artist’s failure. “She outsold!” – meaning, she completely outcompeted her rival – is a common jibe.

“I guess that’s just because fans now see them as family, and will do whatever it takes to protect them,” Douglas says. “Stan culture is wrapped up in a sort of ‘ride or die’ mentality. Loving someone’s music and taking a bullet for them is different; stans tend to lean towards the latter,” he adds."

According to multiple reports, the “Good Morning America” anchor got candid about her Feb. 12 sit-down with the “Empire” actor, who claimed he was attacked in January, telling reporters during her solo panel at The Cut’s “How to Get It Done” event that she didn’t know if she wanted to do the interview in the first place.

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like, I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,” she said on Monday, per Page Six. “I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up.’ And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

Roberts told the audience during the event that she was promised she could challenge Smollett on “red flags” over the alleged assault.

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview,’” she explained.

Her interview, which aired two days after it was taped on Feb. 14, was challenging for the reporter, who said that she felt pressure to represent the LGBT community.

“I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man,” she said. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.’ It was a no-win situation for me.”

However, her highly-publicized sit-down was overshadowed by the news that two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, claimed that Smollett paid them to stage the attack. Roberts stated that if she and the producers had known about the brothers’ claims, she would have asked him about it.

“Had I had that information or what the brothers were alleging — heck, yeah, I would have asked that,” she said, per The Hollywood Reporter. “But it aired that morning [and] we taped it two days ahead of time.”

Smollett has maintained that he is a victim and has denied all the allegations that he staged the incident via his attorney. However, the actor was arrested on Feb. 21 after being charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report in which he claimed he was the victim of a hate crime.

The actor was then released after he posted $10,000 of his $100,000 bond. Smollett’s next hearing is set for March 14.

Watch out. Capitol Hill and Silicon Valley have locked their sights on the next targets of a frightening free speech-squelching purge: independent citizens who dare to raise questions online about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

I’m vaccinated. My children are up to date. There’s no dispute that vaccines have saved untold lives. But over the years, I’ve voiced my concerns about vaccine claims and government coercion in my newspaper columns and blog posts. These concerns include my objections to Gardasil mandates for schoolchildren in Texas and California; schools’ threatening parents with jail time for refusing chickenpox shots for their kids; ineffectiveness of the flu vaccine; contamination issues at vaccine plants abroad; lack of data on vaccines’ long-term and synergistic effects on children; and pharma-funded politicians’ financial conflicts of interest.

In 2004, I recounted my family’s firsthand experience with bully doctors who balked at even the mildest questioning of the wisdom of the newborn hepatitis B immunization. When my husband and I asked if we could simply delay this particular shot, as the vaccine is for a virus that is contracted mostly through intravenous drug use and sexual contact, my son’s pediatrician angrily kicked us out of her practice.

Does this informed skepticism make me and other like-minded parents public health menaces, as the World Health Organization has proclaimed? Are we “sociopaths,” as a journalist at The Atlantic once sneered? Apparently so.

At a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Washington state’s public health secretary, John Wiesman, demanded that the feds launch a national campaign to counter “anti-vaccine” groups that are spreading what he condemned as “false information.” Weisman called for increased funding from the Centers for Disease Control to combat opponents of the state’s push to prevent parents from opting their children out of immunizations for personal or philosophical reasons. Health officials have blamed vaccine critics’ social media influence for recent measles outbreaks. So Wiesman further urged Twitter, Facebook and Google to “use whatever mechanism they have available to stop promoting pseudoscience.”

Let’s be clear: Misinformation of all kinds abounds on the internet. The world’s most influential “mainstream” media websites and celebrity social media accounts, for example, recklessly fanned the flames of the recent Covington Catholic High School and Jussie Smollett hate crime hoaxes. No one in Washington has called for the boycott of The Washington Post or TMZ over their false and misleading stories. But for some reason (hint: pharmaceutical big business), politicians and government bureaucrats are now hell-bent on deplatforming any and all dissenters who challenge mandatory vaccine regimens.

ORDER IT NOW

Under pressure from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Amazon pulled the documentaries “Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,” “Man Made Epidemic” and “Shoot ’em Up: The Truth About Vaccines” from its Prime Video streaming service. Last week, Google-owned YouTube moved to demonetize “anti-vaccine” channels, tweak algorithms to suppress vaccine “conspiracy” videos and combat “vaccine hesitancy.” Pinterest blocks users from using the search terms “vaccine,” “vaccinations” and “anti-vax,” no matter the quality of the results. Facebook plans to downgrade vaccine skeptics’ content on newsfeeds, recommended user groups and ads.

Is there junk science on the “anti-vaccine” side? Sure. But you can’t address this issue without also addressing the problem with physicians and public health flacks who are unwilling to discuss the full risks of vaccines as well as their benefits; pro-vaccination groups that provide incorrect information about vaccines’ duration of protection; physicians who refuse to care for children who are not “fully” vaccinated; and the comparative risk-benefit ratios of different vaccines.

As for efficacy, consider this new data: A recent whooping cough outbreak at the private Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles last week resulted in 30 students contracting the illness, all of whom were vaccinated. Of 18 unvaccinated students, none caught the disease. Will pointing this out on my Facebook and Twitter accounts bring down the Silicon Valley ban hammer?

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who happens to be a physician and parent himself, was the lone voice of dissent at the Senate hearing this week. While acknowledging that the benefits of vaccines generally outweigh their risks, he noted the plain truth that “it is wrong to say there are no risks to vaccines.” He added that over $4 billion has been paid by the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for adults and children who have been injured or died as a result of receiving federally recommended childhood vaccines.

Is it unacceptable fearmongering to raise that point? How about to share information on vaccine manufacturers’ astonishing exemption from product liability? Or to point parents to new research findings on brain injuries caused by vaccines, which can be found at VaccinePapers.org? Or to link them to a recent statement by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which “strongly opposes federal interference in medical decisions, including mandated vaccines.”

When it comes to protecting our children, skepticism is always the best medicine. We need more free speech, not less. Those who seek to suppress debate and discussion in the name of the “public good” are the true health threats.

The documentary about child abuse allegations against Michael Jackson has caused many people to question the future of the King of Pop’s legacy. However, Paris Jackson, 20, is standing by her dad.

Paris Jackson said she he has not seen the documentary and “was not offered the chance to see it before it premiered at Sundance,” TMZ reported. Nonetheless, she “firmly believes” Michael Jackson was not a pedophile.

In 1993, Michael Jackson was accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy. In January of 1994, he reportedly settled for $23 million. The accuser’s father committed suicide in 2009, five months after the singer died. Jordan Chandler reportedly has never come forward about the allegations and supposedly lives outside of the country. In 2017, when Wade Robson, a choreographer who is featured in “Leaving Neverland,” accused Michael Jackson of sexual assault—even though he’d said in the past the singer didn’t assault him—there was a hunt to find Chandler. According to The Daily Mail, he left the U.S. to avoid investigators.

In 2003, Michael Jackson was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent to a 13-year-old boy. He was ultimately acquitted of all charges. Robson testified at the 2003 trial, but James Safechuck, the other person featured in “Leaving Neverland,” did not.

Many people have been saying the documentary is untrue, including Brett Barnes, who said he knew Michael Jackson when he was child. According to TMZ, the film “implies Jackson molested him as a boy. As for why Barnes thinks this … Wade Robson — one of the singer’s well-known alleged victims — claims in the doc, Barnes ‘replaced him.’ The film then shows Michael and Brett together on tour. Thus, the insinuation.”

Barnes has threatened HBO with a lawsuit “claiming the documentary puts him in a false light and subjects him to ‘hatred, contempt and ridicule.’ Presumably, the lawyer is saying MJ supporters will target Barnes as a result of the documentary.”

Barnes testified at Michael Jackson’s criminal trial in 2005 and said he was never assaulted by him. He also tweeted this in January.

Not only do we have to deal with these lies, but we’ve also got to deal with people perpetuating these lies. The fact that they fail to do the small amount of research it takes to prove these are lies, by choice or not, makes it even worse. — Brett Barnes (@IAmBrettBarnes) January 30, 2019

Michael Jackson was acquitted of all charges.

Kelly appeared in an intense, emotional interview on “CBS This Morning,” where he dismissed the allegations against him as nothing more than lies.

“Absolutely they’re lying on me,” Kelly told Gayle King. “I have been assassinated. I have been buried alive, but I’m alive.”

“I didn’t do this stuff,” he said through tears as his voice rose in pitch and volume. “This is not me. I’m fighting for my f—— life.”

Pacing back and forth, screaming and pumping his fists, Kelly yelled: “Y’all killing me with this s—.”

King asked Kelly outright if he’s ever had sex with anyone under 17 years old, to which he replied, “No.”

Kelly said that the allegations of sexual impropriety with underage girls — which have dogged him for more than 20 years — are also hindering his ability to have a relationship with his children.

The renewed scrutiny on Kelly was driven in large part by the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly.” The R&B star said the ubiquity of social media has only fanned those flames.

“I’m just telling the truth,” he told King. “This is the first time I was able to say something.”

Kelly went on to say that the parents of two women who he is dating and living with — Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary — essentially sold their daughters to him. The parents of both women have said that Kelly “brainwashed” the two into staying with him.

“What kind of father, what kind of mother, would sell they daughter to a man?” Kelly asked. “How come it was OK for me to see them until they wasn’t getting no money from it?”

King also interviewed Savage and Clary. The full interview, King said, is set to air Friday at 7 p.m. But in a clip shown Wednesday morning, Clary said: “You guys don’t know the truth. You guys believe in some f—— façade that our parents are saying. This is all f—— lies for money.”

Attorney Michael Avenatti, who represents the parents of Clary, issued a statement on their behalf, saying:

“We have never received a penny from R. Kelly. We have never asked R. Kelly for money. And we never ‘sold’ our daughter to him or anyone else. R. Kelly is a desperate liar and serial abuser of young girls who should die in prison. All of the victims and parents cannot be lying.”

Before the interview aired, King told Chicago’s local CBS station that it was clear that Kelly “is in a lot of pain.”

The interview took place Tuesday in Chicago and lasted 80 minutes, according to CBS.

As Kelly grew more emotional, the interview had to be stopped so he could regain his composure with the help of a publicist.

Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, told the Sun-Times last week that he and his client had discussed hiring a publicist to help manage the tidal wave of media attention on the case.

Mirroring a recent interview by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, Kelly opted to speak to a national media outlet rather than one based in Chicago.

Avenatti, who says he represents one of the victims included in the indictment, said Kelly was right to cry.

“R. Kelly’s tears are out of fear and despair. Because he knows that after over two decades of sexually abusing underage girls, we blew this wide open and have him and his enablers dead to rights,” he tweeted.

Smollett has been charged with filing a false police report, and was last week slammed by Chicago cops for taking advantage “of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Watch out. Capitol Hill and Silicon Valley have locked their sights on the next targets of a frightening free speech-squelching purge: independent citizens who dare to raise questions online about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

I’m vaccinated. My children are up to date. There’s no dispute that vaccines have saved untold lives. But over the years, I’ve voiced my concerns about vaccine claims and government coercion in my newspaper columns and blog posts. These concerns include my objections to Gardasil mandates for schoolchildren in Texas and California; schools threatening parents with jail time for refusing chicken pox shots for their kids; ineffectiveness of the flu vaccine; contamination issues at vaccine plants abroad; lack of data on vaccines’ long-term and synergistic effects on children; and pharma-funded politicians’ financial conflicts of interest.

In 2004, I recounted my family’s firsthand experience with bully doctors who balked at even the mildest questioning of the wisdom of the newborn hepatitis B immunization. When my husband and I asked if we could simply delay this particular shot, as the vaccine is for a virus that is contracted mostly through intravenous drug use and sexual contact, my son’s pediatrician angrily kicked us out of her practice.

Does this informed skepticism make me and other like-minded parents public health menaces, as the World Health Organization has proclaimed? Are we “sociopaths,” as a journalist at The Atlantic once sneered? Apparently so.

At a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Washington state’s public health secretary, John Wiesman, demanded that the feds launch a national campaign to counter “anti-vaccine” groups that are spreading what he condemned as “false information.” Weisman called for increased funding from the Centers for Disease Control to combat opponents of the state’s push to prevent parents from opting their children out of immunizations for personal or philosophical reasons. Health officials have blamed vaccine critics’ social media influence for recent measles outbreaks. So Wiesman further urged Twitter, Facebook and Google to “use whatever mechanism they have available to stop promoting pseudoscience.”

Let’s be clear: Misinformation of all kinds abounds on the internet. The world’s most influential “mainstream” media websites and celebrity social media accounts, for example, recklessly fanned the flames of the recent Covington Catholic High School and Jussie Smollett hate crime hoaxes. No one in Washington has called for the boycott of The Washington Post or TMZ over their false and misleading stories. But for some reason (hint: pharmaceutical big business), politicians and government bureaucrats are now hell-bent on deplatforming any and all dissenters who challenge mandatory vaccine regimens.

Under pressure from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Amazon pulled the documentaries “Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,” “Man Made Epidemic” and “Shoot ’em Up: The Truth About Vaccines” from its Prime Video streaming service. Last week, Google-owned YouTube moved to demonetize “anti-vaccine” channels, tweak algorithms to suppress vaccine “conspiracy” videos and combat “vaccine hesitancy.” Pinterest blocks users from using the search terms “vaccine,” “vaccinations” and “anti-vax,” no matter the quality of the results. Facebook plans to downgrade vaccine skeptics’ content on newsfeeds, recommended user groups and ads.

Is there junk science on the “anti-vaccine” side? Sure. But you can’t address this issue without also addressing the problem with physicians and public health flacks who are unwilling to discuss the full risks of vaccines as well as their benefits; pro-vaccination groups that provide incorrect information about vaccines’ duration of protection; physicians who refuse to care for children who are not “fully” vaccinated; and the comparative risk-benefit ratios of different vaccines.

As for efficacy, consider this new data: A recent whooping cough outbreak at the private Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles last week resulted in 30 students contracting the illness, all of whom were vaccinated. Of 18 unvaccinated students, none caught the disease. Will pointing this out on my Facebook and Twitter accounts bring down the Silicon Valley ban hammer?

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who happens to be a physician and parent himself, was the lone voice of dissent at the Senate hearing this week. While acknowledging that the benefits of vaccines generally outweigh their risks, he noted the plain truth that “it is wrong to say there are no risks to vaccines.” He added that over $4 billion has been paid by the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for adults and children who have been injured or died as a result of receiving federally recommended childhood vaccines.

Is it unacceptable fearmongering to raise that point? How about to share information on vaccine manufacturers’ astonishing exemption from product liability? Or to point parents to new research findings on brain injuries caused by vaccines, which can be found at VaccinePapers.org? Or to link them to a recent statement by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which “strongly opposes federal interference in medical decisions, including mandated vaccines.”

When it comes to protecting our children, skepticism is always the best medicine. We need more free speech, not less. Those who seek to suppress debate and discussion in the name of the “public good” are the true health threats.

Kelly swears he ""didn't do this stuff"" and he's ""fighting for his life"" in his first interview since ""Surviving R. Kelly"" dropped and new allegations of sex abuse surfaced.

""I'm very tired of all of the um, lies, I've been hearing things and seeing things on the blogs, and I'm just tired,"" he told Gayle King on ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday.

The lies that bothered Kelly most, he said, included ""that little girls trapped in a basement, helicopters over my house, trying to rescue someone who doesn't need to be rescued because they're not in my house.""

R. KELLY DENIES SEXUAL ABUSE ALLEGATIONS: 'I DIDN'T DO THIS STUFF'

""[I did] lots of things wrong when it comes to women but I apologized in those relationships,"" he said. He adamantly denied breaking any laws when it comes to women.

""Everybody says something bad about me. Nobody said something good. They was describing Lucifer. I'm not Lucifer. I'm a man. I made mistakes, but I'm not a devil.""

DRAKE'S DAD VOICES SUPPORT FOR R. KELLY, JUSSIE SMOLLETT

Kelly blamed ""the power of social media"" for spreading rumors about his alleged abuse and giving them traction.

""No. No. No,"" he said when asked if he'd ever had sex with any minors, adding that his accusers were ""absolutely"" lying. ""I have been assassinated. I have been buried alive from these lies.""

R. KELLY INSIDERS MAY HAVE ENABLED HIS SEXUAL ABUSE: PROSECUTORS

""I don't need to. Why would I? How stupid would it be for R. Kelly, with all that I've been through in my way, way, past to hold somebody — that's stupid,"" he shouted.

He fumed, ""That's stupid! Use your common sense. Forget the blogs, forget how you feel about me. Hate me if you want to, love me if you want. But just use your common sense. How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I've been through — 'Oh, right now I just think I need to be a monster and hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and don't let them eat, don't let them out, unless they need some shoes down the street from their uncle!'""

R. KELLY ACCUSERS SPEAK OF SINGER'S 'DEMONS,' ALLEGED SEXUAL ABUSE

Kelly then got up and shrieked, sobbing, ""Stop it. You don't quit playing. Quit playing. I didn't do this stuff! This is not me! I'm fighting for my f—king life!""

He cried, ""It's not about music, it's about having a relationship with my kids.""

R. KELLY'S ESTRANGED DAUGHTER CALLS HIM A 'MONSTER'

""I need help. This is the kind of help I need. I need somebody to help me not have a big heart. My heart is so big. People betray me and I keep on giving to them.""

Kelly was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 that centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

R. KELLY, SONY PART WAYS AMID SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS

""For one, I beat my case. When you beat something you beat it. You can't double jeopardy me like that. It's not fair,"" he said.

Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for two Kelly accusers, responded to Kelly's ""double jeopardy"" comment Tuesday on Twitter.

""He fails to understand that it doesn't matter 'how long ago' it happened. And he also has no clue as to how 'double jeopardy' works,"" the attorney tweeted.

MICHAEL AVENATTI CLAIMS R. KELLY HAD SEX WITH UNDERAGE GIRL IN VIDEO

In a follow-up tweet, Avenatti addressed the emotion that Kelly shows in the interview: ""R. Kelly's tears are out of fear and despair. Because he knows that after over two decades of sexually abusing underage girls, we blew this wide open and have him and his enablers dead to rights.""

NEW R. KELLY SEXUAL MISCONDUCT CASE FACES FAMILIAR HURDLES

King's colleagues asked her if she felt unsafe during the interview, which she denied.

""I never felt that,"" she said, adding that she didn't think he'd hit her deliberately but that she said she may have been ""accidentally clobbered ... I never felt in danger talking to him.""

ERYKAH BADU, DA BRAT DEFEND R. KELLY AMID SEX ABUSE ALLEGATIONS

In a second segment, King asked Kelly about his relationship with the two young women currently living in his home, Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary, both 21.

""I love 'em and it's almost like, they're my girlfriends,"" he said. ""We have a relationship. It's real. I've known guys all my life who've had five or six women.""

TWO MORE WOMEN ACCUSE R. KELLY OF SEX ABUSE WHEN THEY WERE UNDERAGE

When asked if he was attracted to young women and girls, Kelly responded, ""I don't look at much younger than me. I look at legal,"" adding of relationships in general, ""One might be older than the other, one might be younger than the other. I just look at legal. There are older men that like younger women, there are younger women that like older men ... I'm a man who likes all women.""

R. KELLY'S LAWYERS THREATEN LIFETIME WITH LAWSUIT OVER 'SURVIVING R. KELLY'

When asked about Clary, he said, ""I'm seeing her."" He denied ""seeing her"" or having a sexual relationship with her when she was 17, though he alleges her parents encouraged him to date her at the time.

""What kind of father, what kind of mother will sell their daughter to a man? How come it was OK for me to see them until they weren't getting no money from me?"" He agreed with King's assertion that the girls' parents ""handed them over.""

""I think they should [buy my music], a lot of them may not. I'm really not fighting for my career here. I'm fighting for my rights and I'm fighting for my relationship with my kids.""

He said of his children, ""They're pressured [not to have a relationship with me]. They're pressured, and I get it.""

R. KELLY'S EX-WIFE BELIEVES 'SURVIVING R. KELLY' GUN THREAT WAS LINKED TO SINGER

When King asked Kelly how he'd react if his daughter told him someone did to her what he's been accused of, he replied, ""I'd be up in that motherf—ker's face f—king everything up ... I would have to arrest myself after I did what I had to do.""

He said the sexual abuse he suffered as a child didn't affect his behavior as an adult, but has affected his music.

R. KELLY ONCE CAUGHT HAVING SEX WITH UNDERAGE AALIYAH, FORMER BACKUP SINGER CLAIMS

He's said he was considering getting help but maintains his innocence despite public opinion being plagued against him.

""People have perception,"" he said. ""I have truth.""

In a preview for King's interview with Savage and Clary, the girls denied being brainwashed, abused or held against their will.

Vaccine Skeptics Under Siege

Although he denied staging the assault, many stars spoke out about the incident.

Queen Latifah is among those celebrities who are standing by Smollett.

The 48-year-old rapper and actress has insisted she will continue to support him until someone can provide “definitive proof” the incident was a hoax.

Speaking to Zainab Salbi on Yahoo News’ ‘Through Her Eyes,” she said: “The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet.

“And that’s just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof — which I haven’t seen yet — then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.”

The “STAR” actress admitted she doesn’t “know what to make” of the scandal, but she hopes everything works out eventually.

She added: “I don’t even know what to make of it.

“All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.”

Following Smollett’s arrest, it was revealed his character, Jamal Lyon, would be written out of the final two episodes of season five of “Empire” to prevent further “disruption” to filming.

Producers including Lee Daniels and Danny Strong said in a statement last month: “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”"

According to the report, Republican strategist Rick Tyler, who had previously worked on Sen.

In particular, the White House threatened to endorse his primary opponent unless he cut Tyler from his payroll.

A half a dozen longtime GOP consultants tell The Daily Beast that this has become standard operating procedure for the Trump White House, which they claim “operates as a cult of personality, insisting on lockstep loyalty above every other consideration—even at the expense of competent political practice.”

GOP strategist Susan Del Percio, who has also been harshly critical of Trump, explains to the Daily Beast that the White House’s entire political operation is bent on getting back at its critics.

“There’s no sophistication,” she said. “They are not trying to pick winners and losers at all. They are not getting involved in the races. They are simply vengeful… They’re just going after political enemies.”

The ‘It’s anti-Zionism, not anti-Semitism’ dodge doesn’t wash.

The Democrats have a couple of problems: One is that they have spent many years complaining about being labeled “socialists” only to see their party come to be dominated by self-proclaimed socialists such as Senator Bernie Sanders (the gentleman from Vermont is a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination but is not a member of the party) and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who, in spite of her pricey education, does not give the impression that she could be relied upon to spell bourgeoisie.

Well.

If the Democrats have a minor socialist problem, they have a major problem in the form of Jew-hating weirdos, preeminent among them the Reverend Louis Farrakhan of the so-called Nation of Islam. Farrakhan has been an out-and-proud Jew-hating weirdo for many decades now, but Democrats still feel the need to make gestures of obeisance before him: Anti-Trump leaders such as Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour of the Women’s March have embraced Farrakhan and courted his favor. Barack Obama came a-calling in 2005 when he was ramping up his political career. The Congressional Black Caucus has consulted him. Bill Clinton stood alongside him at Aretha Franklin’s funeral, implicitly elevating the cult leader. California Democrats Barbara Lee and Maxine Waters attend Farrakhan’s public events, and Obama-administration veteran Eric Holder recently posed for a picture with him.

Farrakhan is an anti-Semite. About that there is no real debate. Eric Holder? Maxine Waters? Others who confer status and influence on Farrakhan and his gang? Maybe they aren’t anti-Semites. They certainly are collaborators.

Farrakhan isn’t the end of it, though.

MSNBC continues to prominently feature the Reverend Al Sharpton. He was Jussie Smollett before Jussie Smollett was in the matter of the Tawana Brawley hate-crime/rape hoax, and his rabble-rousing attacks on Jewish “bloodsuckers” and “interlopers” preceded the mass murder at Freddie’s Fashion Mart. He inflamed anti-Semitic passions leading up to the Crown Heights riots. Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes apparently are content to be affiliated with him.

Newly elected Representative Ilhan Omar apparently cannot open her mouth without letting out an anti-Semitic libel accusing Jews of being unpatriotic (the “dual loyalty” canard) and of bribing U.S. political leaders into supporting Israel. The Jews, she insists, “push for allegiance to a foreign country.”

Representative Rashida Tlaib has similar problems and turns out to have been a contributor to one of Farrakhan’s batty publications. Members of the Democratic Socialists of America — Representative Ocasio-Cortez is a member — recently chanted eliminationist slogans calling for the liquidation of the Jewish state.

“Oh, that’s not anti-Semitism!” their apologists will say. “That’s anti-Zionism.”

Farrakhan has used the same line of defense. But it doesn’t wash. The viciousness and slander of the Democrats’ attacks on Israel are unique; give them a Cuban police state or a Venezuelan dictatorship and they’re kittens, but give them a polity full of Jews and they’re jackals. The double standards and unreasoning hatred of the progressive view of Israel simply does not have an equivalent associated with a non-Jewish state. Even their anti-Americanism is not quite as poisonous.

Anti-Semites? Collaborators? Something in between?

The Democrats have just been shamed into introducing an anti-anti-Semitism resolution in the House. In remarkably cowardly fashion, it does not name any names or even address the “anti-Zionism” dodge.

Strangely, the Democrats can, on occasion, work up some excitement on the question. Democrats love to lambaste the rich for weaponizing their fortunes in political fights. But Representative Jerrold Nadler accused a Republican colleague of anti-Semitism for rendering the name of billionaire progressive activist Tom Steyer as “$teyer.” Steyer, who has pledged many millions of dollars in support of sundry left-wing causes, is an Episcopalian, like his mother.

The Democrats bucked at being called socialists until their revolutionary vanguard began to come out as frank socialists. They complain about being called anti-Semites, too, which is a funny thing for friends and associates of Louis Farrakhan and Ilhan Omar to do. They can pass all the resolutions they like, but they will rightly be judged by the company they keep."

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Queen Latifah still believes Empire actor Jussie Smollett, questioning claims that he faked a hate crime attack.

Smollett is facing charges of filing a fake police report after alleging in January that he was the victim of a homophobic and racist attack.

The actor has maintained his innocence, but two associates of Smollett, who were previously suspects in the case, have accused him of perpetrating the attack on himself.

Queen Latifah: I’m going with Jussie ‘until I see definitive proof’

Speaking to Yahoo News show Through Her Eyes on Tuesday (March 5), former Empire guest star Queen Latifah said she is still giving Smollett the benefit of the doubt.

She said: “Until somebody can show me some proof otherwise, I’m going with him.

“The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet, and that’s just the guy I know.

“Until I can see some definitive proof, which I haven’t seen yet… then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.”

Queen Latifah added: “I think you should always be aware of that. This whole thing started off by him allegedly being attacked. Everything that’s happened since then, who knows what it is?

“I don’t even know what to make of it. I hope everything works out in the end and everybody comes out unscathed.”

Jussie Smollett suspended from Empire over ‘disturbing’ claims

Smollett was suspended from Fox show Empire following his arrest on February 21.

In a statement reported by Entertainment Weekly on February 22, Empire‘s executive producers said that “to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

They called the charges against Smollett “very disturbing.”

Smollett could face up to three years in prison and $25,000 in fines if found guilty of arranging what Police Chief Eddie T. Johnson called a “hoax” in a press briefing on February 21.

Johnson said: “This announcement today recognises that Empire actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

The police chief, who is African-American himself, called Smollett’s behaviour “shameful,” adding: “I’m left hanging my head and asking, why?”

In a statement released on February 21 after his arrest, Smollett said he felt “betrayed” by authorities, and the actor has maintained his innocence."

Opinion contributor

The past two weeks have been surreal. On Feb. 19, while recruiting conservative students on campus at the University of California-Berkeley, I was assaulted by a violent leftist. A little more than a week later, I got to shake hands with the president of the United States and address an audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference about why it's more important than ever to protect free speech on our college campuses.

As a field representative for the Leadership Institute, I travel to campuses throughout California helping conservative clubs recruit and train new members. I've seen the intolerance and hate toward conservatives on our campuses with my own eyes, and the only difference between what happened to me on Feb. 19 and every other day is that the event was caught on video.

Conservative students across the country have suffered verbal and physical assault, social ostracism and even academic persecution for voicing their opinions on political topics. This is because young liberals believe that they are on the morally righteous side in a culture war and, in order to win, they must silence any form of dissent. Leftists and the progressives aspire to nothing less than to make it de facto impossible to be conservative in public.

Take it from a conservative professor: Hand-wringing over intellectual diversity is overblown

How to handle a kid who won't say the Pledge: First, don't tell him to leave America.

The United States is well on its way to achieving this goal, based on the Covington Catholic High School incident. Wearing a red hat near the Lincoln Memorial was apparently enough for the news and social media personalities to label the act provocation, and commentators worked aggressively to ""dox"" the students. In their frenzy, students were even misidentified, and at least one boy and his family were allegedly harassed. By contrast, there was not a similar rush to expose the identity of the man who was caught on video assaulting me.

Differing political ideas treated as violent

Increasingly, leftists believe they are justified to respond to ideas disagreeable to them with open hostility and even force. Students are commonly told now that words are literally violent and can be responded to with physical force. I don't mean verbal threats of violence or efforts to intimidate, I mean words that express ideas that the listener finds offensive or disagrees with.

The message that provoked my attacker was our sign that read ""Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,"" a reference to the recent case of Jussie Smollett, who was charged by Chicago police with filing a false police report about an apparently fictitious attack. My attacker said we were promoting violence, which, in his view, gives him permission to use any means necessary to shut us down. The irony is that the sign was intended to warn of the danger of disregarding facts and jumping to judgment in an effort to confirm a narrative our feelings tell us is true.

The message applies to more than the Smollett story, and the search for truth is certainly relevant on campuses of higher education, where students are supposed to grow personally and intellectually — not only through textbook and classroom learning but also by exchanging ideas, debating tough topics, and being challenged to defend their views. This growth cannot happen when speech is restricted — that's not only a disservice to students but a threat to our republic as well.

Berkeley's anti-conservative record

The Berkeley administration in particular has allowed a culture of intolerance and violence toward conservatives to grow. The College Republicans club has had its property vandalized, and critics have called for the members to be lynched. When there was a pro-Trump rally in April 2017, a former community college professor was arrested for allegedly assaulting multiple supporters with a bike lock. He later accepted a plea deal.

When Milo Yiannopoulos visited in February 2017, the campus became the site of violent riots. Some people even threw Molotov cocktails and fireworks, injuring students and causing $100,000 worth of damage to the school. Berkeley police canceled the speech after ""an apparently organized violent attack and destruction of property"" forced them to evacuate Yiannopoulos for his own protection.

After I was assaulted, a university employee tweeted (now deleted), ""The MAGA people on UC Berkeley campus yesterday got punched in the face by someone this makes me feel emotionally so much better.""

Since the arrest last week of the person who assaulted me, we have learned that he was once a student and employee of UC Berkeley.

Progress depends on the freedom of the human person to develop ideas and voice them. And we’re all better when this intellectual growth happens. The battle to protect free speech is one of the most important culture battles facing our nation today.

There are so many students across the country fighting for their right to free speech. They don’t do it for recognition; they do it because they understand how imperative this human right is and are willing to defend it.

President Donald Trump's forthcoming executive order requiring colleges and universities to protect free speech in order to receive federal funds shows that he agrees. I'm proud of our president and, as I get ready to head back out in the field, I draw strength in knowing that we have his support and the support of conservative students who continue to stand up for their political beliefs.

In this age of intersectionality in social justice movements, it’s clear that Jussie Smollet’s case has lacked true intersectional understanding in the period since the Chicago Police Department made their accusations against him.

It has been telling to witness how many people, activists and media alike, took the CPD’s statements as truth and turned on Smollett.

Smollett grew up in a family that has close ties to Angela Davis and the Black Panther Party and has been an activist and artist since his childhood. He has been outspoken about many of President’s Trump’s policies, and taught songwriting in Illinois prisons. He is a Black Gay artist who speaks out.

The Chicago Police Department, on the other hand, has a long history to indicate its statements should not be trusted automatically. From the murder of Fred Hampton, to numerous inexcusable murders of young Black men caught on film which police officers initially lied about, to the fact that they can’t seem to figure out how to do anything to lessen the rate by which Black children are murdering each other in the streets of the city, their history shows an ongoing issue with honesty, capability, and transparency that not been rectified.

Yet, when they came out with their version of what happened in Smollett’s case, people responded like the truth had been revealed. This, despite the consciousness that Black Lives Matters has raised in recent years. This, despite the unconvincing evidence CPD has released. This, simply because they are the authority speaking the truth, and a Black man facing that is muted until completely slandered, innocent or not. Many in the Black community also turned on Smollett quickly, and his employer cut him from the last episodes of the season, demonstrating the ingrained nature of America’s deference to authority, whether that authority has a history of corruption or not.

The Evidence Is Not Convincing

The evidence the CPD have presented in the case hinge on the words of two brothers. Chicago news stations released footage showing the brothers buying ski masks, which are common in Chicago winters, and a red hat, which Smollett never stated the attackers were wearing. The police say they also have video evidence of the brothers leaving the scene, getting in a cab, text messages detailing the plans of a staged attack, etc, none of which has not been publicly shown. All that has been released is a grainy photo of two people who are impossible to identify. It’s not even clear in the photo if the people are wearing ski masks, though neither appears to be wearing a baseball hat. The fact that bleach was found in the brother’s home was reported as damning evidence.

CPD’s story has changed. Initially they said they considered Smollett a victim. “Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that…Smollett has been ‘very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.'” But after deciding to prosecute him, “Chicago’s police chief said they were suspicious when ‘Empire’ star Jussie Smollett first told detectives that two masked men taunted him with racist and homophobic slurs before beating him and looping a noose around his neck. ‘From the very beginning we had some questions about it,’ Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.”

This is damning testimony. How can police accurately investigate a case they do not believe?

What is particularly absurd about the CPD’s case against Smollett is the motive they say they have discovered: that Smollett wanted more money for his work on Empire, something denied by both Smollett and Empire. There is no evidence for this whatsoever, yet CPD speaks as though they have read Smollett’s mind and ascertained his true nature. In fact they said, “When we discovered the actual motive, quite frankly, it pissed everybody off.” The truth is they did not ‘discover’ the ‘actual’ motive.

In fact, if CPD’s accusations are correct and Smollett made up this attack for attention, why was it his 60 year old friend who called the police and convinced him to file a police report in the first place?

The police say they have evidence but they have not shown it publicly. Therefore, innocent until proven guilty must stand. Not innocent until the police say you’re guilty, or innocent until the media says you are, because then a huge portion of the country will never get justice. Railroading someone into prison is not a hard thing to do.

Intersectionality Means Understanding Nuance

Though many have called the evidence CPD presented as “overwhelming,” this brings us to the deeper part of the intersection that many are missing and which needs to be kept in mind – the history of dirty tactics in the prosecution of Black men.

Initially the Osundairo’s lawyer said “they’re all very cordial with each other, so they’re baffled why they are people of interest.” However, “at hour 47 – one hour before police had to either charge the men or release them – Johnson said the two confessed to what they had done. They were subsequently released without being charged.” This seems strange.

If you’re not familiar with how Black men are prosecuted in this country, it can feel like wading into a muck of poison to hear even snippets of it. This is a country where Black men clearly have an unwanted intimacy with the criminal justice system and where the majority of federal cases don’t even go to trial – “Ninety-seven percent of federal convictions and ninety-four percent of state convictions are the results of guilty pleas.” Instead, people plead guilty en masse to get a lesser sentence. The implications here are enormous.

This is a country where ‘snitching’ – as it is well-known in the Black community – can get you reduced time. There is an organized though quiet official system where giving accurate or inaccurate information about your peers can get years shaved off your sentence, or no sentence at all, among other perks. In such a system, where ‘testimony’ holds such deep weight, the problem is obvious.

“Snitching has become so commonplace that in the past five years at least 48,895 federal convicts — one of every eight — had their prison sentences reduced in exchange for helping government investigators, a USA TODAY examination of hundreds of thousands of court cases found.”

This is not written to accuse the police of anything in particular, to say that the Osundairo’s testimony is inaccurate, or to say that Smollett is absolutely innocent. But innocent until proven guilty is a basic standard that must be adhered to. Otherwise, confusion and abuse of power will reign and people will continue to be easily manipulated in countless ways."

And her followers praised her for holding her own against Kelly.

Ava Du Vernay wrote: ‘Second picture. Whoa’, while Busy Phillips commented: ‘These pictures are so intense.’

Another person commented: ‘Your composure in the face of what must’ve been an incredibly challenging conversation is a lesson for us all’, while we seriously related to a comment reading: ‘Your whole face is a whole mood.’

And the praise for King continued over on Twitter:

This is Kelly’s first interview since being charged with aggravated sexual abuse, following new light being shed on the allegations made against him in the documentary Surviving R Kelly.

Kelly’s lawyer Steve Greenberg entered a not guilty plea for the singer, with court documents revealing that three of the four women accusing Kelly of abuse were underage at the time of the alleged abuse.

The R’n’B star was freed from jail after posting $100,000 of a $1 million bail, and insisted he is innocent in a preview of the CBS interview.

Breaking down in tears in front of Gayle, who asked if he had every held any girl or woman against their will, he said: ‘How stupid would that be for R Kelly, for all I’ve been through in my way, way past, to hold somebody, let alone four, five, six, 50… how stupid would I be to do that? That’s stupid! Use your common sense.

‘I didn’t do this stuff. This is not me. I’m fighting for my fucking life.’

However, Jussie has since been charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report on 29 January, with Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson accusing the actor of staging the controversy to increase his pay packet.

Terrence Howard is also standing by Jussie Smollett (Picture: Fox)

It was claimed that the actor staged the attack due to his unhappiness with his salary on TV drama Empire but sources close to show runners have debunked any suggestion that his wage was his motive, alleging that he never once asked for a pay rise.

He was already making a reported $125,000 (£95,000) per episode, while his co-stars Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard are said to take home $250,000 (£187,000) each instalment.

But at a Hillsdale College leadership seminar Feb. 21 in Costa Mesa, Christopher Bedford, editor-in-chief of The Daily Caller News Foundation, and Shelby Steele, author and Senior Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, delineated corruption in the news media and in liberalism, respectively.

For nearly a century the high standing of the print and electronic news media has rested on their dedication to factual accuracy and the impartiality on which it depends. But in recent decades that profession has been severely criticized for political biases that misrepresent both causes and public figures to such an extent that many citizens have lost all confidence in news reporting.

Bedford weighed in with an even more fundamental criticism, particularly of the Washington press corps: laziness. ”Washington is a city of deeply stupid people — arrogant and smug, shallow, self-absorbed, continuously failing upward,” including politicians no less than journalists.

Later in his talk, Bedford described the press as a “Praetorian Guard for Silicon Valley, colleges, and Democrats — generally protecting the wealthy from the people.”

An outspoken supporter of President Trump, Bedford recalled the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign in which the media immediately got the businessman wrong, seeing him as a cold fish, not friendly to common folks. But in the Iowa caucus, he said, Trump mixed easily in a gymnasium with men in jeans and boots, along with Vietnam veterans.

Trump didn’t change his dress, depending on who he was with and, unlike other GOP hopefuls, did not grant private interviews and then slip away. He would go into diners and light up the room.

The media, Bedford charged, have no connection with most Americans, deciding what questions can be asked. He recounted the incident with the boys from Covington High School who were accused of harassing a tribal “chief” when in fact the opposite was the truth.

That incident encapsulates the major point of Shelby Steele, an early supporter of the civil rights movement when he was one of only a few black students to enroll at Coe College in Iowa but now views it as a tool of modern liberalism to keep blacks dependent on the government and squander their natural potential for accomplishment.

Steele described the 1960s as the “most transformative” decade in our nation’s history. He drew a parallel with the Garden of Eden in that this nation, like Adam and Eve, had a fall from which there has been no recovery. The nation lost its innocence, face to face with the reality of its original sin of slavery, henceforward seen as “the worst evil in all human history…Slavery was a life of no hope, a cosmic horror which dehumanized people.”

Since then the issue has been who can be innocent of this evil, an honor which liberals, as the main sponsors of civil rights laws, immediately claimed. Those who opposed them were racists, unable to shed their white guilt, Steele said.

This development had the effect, Steele maintained, of transforming liberalism from an ideology to an identity. While most Americans “live under the suspicion of being racist,” those who engage in what he called “virtue signaling” can claim to be innocent of the alleged evils of Western Civilization.

Innocence of racism brings moral authority, which brings power over others who lead “defensive lives.” Blacks are “Uncle Toms” if they don’t say they’re victims, according to Steele. And Jussie Smollett “hatched a stunning scheme to capture white guilt. “Hollywood and the media ate it up.”

Summing up, Steele declared that: 1. liberalism is bankrupt and corrupt; 2. Race has poisoned our society; 3. Liberalism is worse than old racial segregation; 4 Blacks should fight for their individual progress, not “social justice.”

What matters, he said, is humanity, not race. “I am a human being; that’s enough.”

Although Hillsdale College presents most seminars on its southern Michigan campus, others are held around the country. It has earned a reputation for independence and genuine liberal learning in an atmosphere free of intimidation and bullying. It takes no federal subsidies and is therefore free to chart its own course.

In plain words, students who attend Hillsdale are not subjected to the indoctrination that dominates far too many campuses today. Those who have read the ancient Greek poet Aristophanes’ play “Clouds,” that pokes fun at higher learning in Athens, will appreciate its relevance for today, especially the ending.

Smollett has been charged with filing a false police report, and was last week slammed by Chicago police officers for taking advantage “of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

But Queen Latifah said: “The guy I have seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who is very kind and who is always been cool and sweet. And that is just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof – which I have not seen yet – then, you know, I got to go with him until I see otherwise.”

Before the case erupted, Smollett last summer told Billboard that he was struggling with the pressures of fame. “I’m in my 30s and I’m trying my best to learn that I can’t bend anymore. I’m about to break,” he said.

Queen Latifah, who once appeared on “Empire” in a crossover episode with Smolett, said on a news show: “I don’t even know what to make of it.

“All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.”

Smollett reported in January that he was attacked by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs. Chicago police initially called it a possible hate crime, but now say that Smollett hired two acquaintances from “Empire” – brothers Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo – to help him stage the assault.

She said she simply hopes “everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.” Latifah once appeared on “Empire” during a crossover episode with FOX’s “Star,” a series that she is a regular.

CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD BLASTS JUSSIE SMOLLETT FOR ALLEGED HOAX: 'I NEVER BELIEVED THIS STORY'

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said last month that Smollett, 36, orchestrated a ""phony attack"" in order to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

BROTHER INVOLVED IN ALLEGED JUSSIE SMOLLETT STAGED ATTACK SAY THEY 'REGRET' THEIR INVOLVEMENT

Johnson said at the news conference that Smollett also sent a racist and homophobic threatening letter to himself at the Fox studio lot before the attack because he was dissatisfied with his salary.

Smollett is currently out on a $100,000 bond and is scheduled back in court March 14. His role as “Jamal” on “Empire” has since been reduced and he’s been scrubbed from the final two episodes of the season."

Capitol Hill and Silicon Valley have locked their sights on the next targets of a frightening free speech-squelching purge: independent citizens who dare to raise questions online about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

I'm vaccinated. My children are up to date. There's no dispute that vaccines have saved untold lives. But over the years, I've voiced my concerns about vaccine claims and government coercion in my newspaper columns and blog posts. These concerns include my objections to Gardasil mandates for schoolchildren in Texas and California; schools' threatening parents with jail time for refusing chickenpox shots for their kids; ineffectiveness of the flu vaccine; contamination issues at vaccine plants abroad; lack of data on vaccines' long-term and synergistic effects on children; and pharma-funded politicians' financial conflicts of interest.

In 2004, I recounted my family's firsthand experience with bully doctors who balked at even the mildest questioning of the wisdom of the newborn hepatitis B immunization. When my husband and I asked if we could simply delay this particular shot, as the vaccine is for a virus that is contracted mostly through intravenous drug use and sexual contact, my son's pediatrician angrily kicked us out of her practice.

Does this informed skepticism make me and other like-minded parents public health menaces, as the World Health Organization has proclaimed? Are we ""sociopaths,"" as a journalist at The Atlantic once sneered? Apparently so.

At a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Washington state's public health secretary, John Wiesman, demanded that the feds launch a national campaign to counter ""anti-vaccine"" groups that are spreading what he condemned as ""false information."" Weisman called for increased funding from the Centers for Disease Control to combat opponents of the state's push to prevent parents from opting their children out of immunizations for personal or philosophical reasons. Health officials have blamed vaccine critics' social media influence for recent measles outbreaks. So Wiesman further urged Twitter, Facebook and Google to ""use whatever mechanism they have available to stop promoting pseudoscience.""

TRENDING: White House condemns TV host's 'insensitive' mocking of Barron Trump

Let's be clear: Misinformation of all kinds abounds on the internet. The world's most influential ""mainstream"" media websites and celebrity social media accounts, for example, recklessly fanned the flames of the recent Covington Catholic High School and Jussie Smollett hate crime hoaxes. No one in Washington has called for the boycott of the Washington Post or TMZ over their false and misleading stories. But for some reason (hint: pharmaceutical big business), politicians and government bureaucrats are now hell-bent on deplatforming any and all dissenters who challenge mandatory vaccine regimens.

Under pressure from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Amazon pulled the documentaries ""Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,"" ""Man Made Epidemic"" and ""Shoot 'em Up: The Truth About Vaccines"" from its Prime Video streaming service. Last week, Google-owned YouTube moved to demonetize ""anti-vaccine"" channels, tweak algorithms to suppress vaccine ""conspiracy"" videos and combat ""vaccine hesitancy."" Pinterest blocks users from using the search terms ""vaccine,"" ""vaccinations"" and ""anti-vax,"" no matter the quality of the results. Facebook plans to downgrade vaccine skeptics' content on newsfeeds, recommended user groups and ads.

Is there junk science on the ""anti-vaccine"" side? Sure. But you can't address this issue without also addressing the problem with physicians and public health flacks who are unwilling to discuss the full risks of vaccines as well as their benefits; pro-vaccination groups that provide incorrect information about vaccines' duration of protection; physicians who refuse to care for children who are not ""fully"" vaccinated; and the comparative risk-benefit ratios of different vaccines.

As for efficacy, consider this new data: A recent whooping cough outbreak at the private Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles last week resulted in 30 students contracting the illness, all of whom were vaccinated. Of 18 unvaccinated students, none caught the disease. Will pointing this out on my Facebook and Twitter accounts bring down the Silicon Valley ban hammer?

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who happens to be a physician and parent himself, was the lone voice of dissent at the Senate hearing this week. While acknowledging that the benefits of vaccines generally outweigh their risks, he noted the plain truth that ""it is wrong to say there are no risks to vaccines."" He added that over $4 billion has been paid by the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for adults and children who have been injured or died as a result of receiving federally recommended childhood vaccines.

Is it unacceptable fearmongering to raise that point? How about to share information on vaccine manufacturers' astonishing exemption from product liability? Or to point parents to new research findings on brain injuries caused by vaccines, which can be found at VaccinePapers.org? Or to link them to a recent statement by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which ""strongly opposes federal interference in medical decisions, including mandated vaccines.""

When it comes to protecting our children, skepticism is always the best medicine. We need more free speech, not less. Those who seek to suppress debate and discussion in the name of the ""public good"" are the true health threats."

The Concocted News Network (CNN) assembled the usual assortment of hate merchants and race pimps to reinforce their preconceived conclusion that every person who voted for Donald Trump was responsible for the supposed violent attack on this modern day equivalent of Rosa Parks. Kamala Harris almost dislocated her thumbs in her haste to be the first political hack to tweet her support for Smollett.

But then the unthinkable occurred. Smollett was exposed as a lying fraud, and arrested as a consequence. Now the celebrities and commentators who took up cudgels on Smollett’s behalf are left looking like the fools which they actually are. Smollett’s acting career seems to be in dire jeopardy but there is a bright spot on his horizon as a result of this incident. Almost all of our news organizations are actively seeking accomplished fabricators of fake news. Jussie Smollett should be at the top of this list.

Queen Latifah is standing by Jussie Smollett. The 'Empire' actor has been charged with filing a false police report after claiming he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in January and after he denied staging the assault, the 48-year-old rapper-and-actress has insisted she will continue to support him until someone can provide ""definitive proof"" the incident was a hoax. She said: ""The guy I've seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who's very kind and who's always been cool and sweet. ""And that's just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof - which I haven't seen yet - then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise."" But the 'STAR' actress admitted she doesn't ""know what to make"" of the scandal, but she hopes everything works out eventually.

Speaking to Zainab Salbi on Yahoo News' 'Through Her Eyes', she added: ""I don't even know what to make of it.

""All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.""

Following Jussie's arrest, it was revealed his character, Jamal Lyon, would be written out of the final two episodes of season five of 'Empire' to prevent further ""disruption"" to filming.

Producers including Lee Daniels and Danny Strong said in a statement last month: ""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our 'Empire' family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""

The 36-year-old actor has been praised by his legal team as a ""young man of impeccable character"" in a statement that hit out at the way the investigation has been handled.

The lawyers said in a statement: ""Today we witnessed an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing."""

In an op-ed for state-run Russia Today, journalist Robert Bridge claims left-leaning media giants have entered their third consecutive year of open warfare against Donald Trump.

Rt.com reports: This non-stop assault risks aggravating political passions to the point where ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ snowballs into something completely beyond our ability to control. Like full-blown Civil War.

Over the weekend, the Washington Post, one of most prominent serial producers of partisan agitation, published an article entitled, ‘In America, talk turns to something unspoken for 150 years: Civil War’. The piece, which deftly places Democrats above the fray, opens with the following whiff of grapeshot:

“With the report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III reportedly nearly complete, impeachment talk in the air and the 2020 presidential election ramping up … there’s talk of violence, mayhem and, increasingly, civil war,” the Bezos-owned paper forewarned.

CNN Asks What Would Happen If Trump Refuses to Accept Defeat in 2020 https://t.co/Rw1r0TqUrz — Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) February 24, 2019

With a level of audacity and self-righteousness that has become a trademark of the Left, not once did the article float the possibility that just maybe the mainstream media is complicit in the ongoing deterioration of political discourse, or that the Democrats are just as much to blame as the Republicans for the political fallout that now presents a grave risk to the Republic.

As many knowledgeable Americans will openly admit, battle lines have been drawn across the political and cultural frontier. This division is perhaps most conspicuous on social media, where friends and family who disagree with our political worldview get the ‘nuke option’ and are effortlessly vanquished (‘unfriended’) with the push of a button. This is a worrying development. The real danger will come when Americans from both sides of the political divide stop talking and start erecting electronic barriers around their political belief systems. Not even family members are spared from the tumult; just because people share the same bloodline does not automatically mean they share the same political views. America, though still green behind the ears, may understand that fact better than many other countries.

The United States has taken part in its fair share of military conflicts over the years, but its deadliest war to date has been the one that pitted Americans against each other. The so-called Civil War (1861-1865), waged between the North and South over the question of Southern secession from the Union, resulted in the death of some 620,000 soldiers from the Union and Confederate armies (and possibly as high as 850,000, according to other estimates).

Put another way, more Americans died in the Civil War than in all of the country’s other conflicts combined. For a country that has been at war for much of its existence that is a sobering fact.

With that historical footnote in mind, the mainstream media should better appreciate its responsibility for presenting an objective and balanced depiction of modern events. Yet nothing today would suggest that is the case. One need only look at the way it has blotched recent politically charged events – like the Covington High School and Jussie Smollett scandals, not to mention the ‘Russia collusion’ hoax – to say that something is seriously out of whack inside of the Fourth Estate. The muzzled mainstream media has simply lost its mind over Donald Trump and can no longer perform its duties with any discernible amount of objectivity.

Indeed, the US leader continues to serve as a piñata for the agenda-driven media, which takes daily swings at him and his administration – and despite the fact that his popularity remains very high among voters. Only on the fringes of the media world, in the far away land of Fox News and Breitbart, will the reader find level-headed reports on the American president. This is not to suggest, of course, that Trump is beyond criticism. Not at all. There is a lot not to like about the 45th president. At the same time, however, to assume that Trump and his administration is the root of all evil, as the media would lead us to believe, is not only ridiculous, it is outright dangerous.

With no loss of irony, a good example of the media bias against Trump can be found in the very Post article that frets over the outbreak of another Civil War. While everyone knows that it takes two to tango, you would never guess that by reading this piece. In the sheltered world of the Liberal-dominated media, ‘tango’ is a solo event where the political right is portrayed as engaged in a dance with itself, while the political left watches – innocuously, of course – from the sidelines.

Michael Cohen, for example, Trump’s turncoat personal lawyer who committed perjury by lying to Congress, was quoted high in the article as saying, “Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power.”

Now that is certainly rich. Ever since Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, Washington has been consumed by the Mueller investigation, and amid mindless chatter that Trump is an illegitimate president slated for impeachment. In other words, the last thing that can be said about the Democrats is that they facilitated a “peaceful transition of power.” In fact, they have hobbled Trump and his administration ever since he entered the Oval Office.

Another pro-Liberal voice dragged into the Civil War story was Robert Reich, who served on Barack Obama’s economic transition advisory board. The Post linked to an article Reich wrote last year where he posited the fictional scenario where an impeachment resolution against the president is enacted, thus kicking off mass civil strife on the direct command of dear leader.

“Trump claims it’s the work of the ‘deep state’”, according to Reich’s febrile imagination. “Sean Hannity of Fox News demands that every honest patriot take to the streets. Right-wing social media call for war. As insurrection spreads, Mr. Trump commands the armed forces to side with the ‘patriots.’”

“The way Mr. Trump and his defenders are behaving, it’s not absurd to imagine serious social unrest,” Reich continued. “That’s how low he’s taken us.”

Now that is some world-class chutzpah. In fact, it is the same self-righteous, ingratiating tone that weaves itself throughout the Post article. In keeping with the mainstream media’s non-stop narrative, Trump and the Republicans are blamed for everything that has gone wrong in the country, while the Democrats come off as little angels trying to piece the fractured country back together.

As already mentioned, Donald Trump is certainly not above criticism. Far from it. But for the mainstream media to place all of the blame for the current political malaise at the Republican’s door is about as responsible as lighting up a cigarette inside of a Chinese fireworks factory. The US media has an unmistakable agenda, and that is to make damn sure Trump is not reelected to another term in 2020. To that end, it has shown a devious willingness to betray all journalistic ethics and standards, which has the effect of increasing the political temperature to boiling point. It then points the finger of blame at the political right for the accumulated pile of pent-up tensions, which are ready to ignite at the first spark.

If the mainstream media continues to slavishly serve just one political master over another, it will only have itself to blame for what comes next. Its prejudiced and agenda-based reporting is a disgrace and really nothing short of a bona fide national security threat."

No word on whether she considers the mountain of evidence alleged by Chicago Police to be legitimiate in her eyes.

Despite Smollett facing felony charges filed by the Chicago Police Department regarding an alleged “hate crime” that took place on January 29, Latifah said during a television interview that -- in this case at least -- she subscribes to the principle of “innocent until proven guilty.”

The remarks were made during an awkward discussion Latifah had with Zainab Salbi, the host of Yahoo News’ Through Her Eyes program, who asked if society should be compassionate with someone who might have fabricated an attack on himself.

Even though the guest started by replying “I’m not about to discuss Jussie Smollett,” she quickly added:

Until someone can show me some proof otherwise, I’m going with him, you know, because the guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about other people, who cares about others, who’s always cool and sweet. And that’s just the guy I know.

“So until I can see some definitive proof, which I haven’t seen yet, then, you know, I gotta go with him,” Latifah continued.

Salbi responded by being sympathetic to her hot take: “Justice does not apply equally in this country, and there is a racial dynamic out of it, and particularly in Chicago....How could we look, should we look at it from a racial justice lens?”

After a halting start, Latifah launched into a history lesson of claims made about the incident.

“I mean, this whole thing started off from him allegedly being attacked by some guys who appear to be white guys wearing a hat that said ‘Make America Great Again’ and yelled epithets at him and said ‘This is MAGA Country.’”

With that in mind, she added: “So how could you not look -- you know, take that into account?”

But as NewsBusters previously reported, the assertions about the assailants brandishing the Trump-related slogan were never supported from the start.

Latifah then began to acknowledge that other claims have not been proven true.

“But everything that’s happened since then, you know, has been -- ,” she stumbled. “Who knows what it is? I don’t even know what to make of it.”

“All I know is that, I hope, you know, everything works out in the end and, you know, everybody basically comes out unscathed,” the guest concluded.

Capitol Hill and Silicon Valley have locked their sights on the next targets of a frightening free speech-squelching purge: independent citizens who dare to raise questions online about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

I'm vaccinated. My children are up to date. There's no dispute that vaccines have saved untold lives. But over the years, I've voiced my concerns about vaccine claims and government coercion in my newspaper columns and blog posts. These concerns include my objections to Gardasil mandates for schoolchildren in Texas and California; schools' threatening parents with jail time for refusing chickenpox shots for their kids; ineffectiveness of the flu vaccine; contamination issues at vaccine plants abroad; lack of data on vaccines' long-term and synergistic effects on children; and pharma-funded politicians' financial conflicts of interest.

In 2004, I recounted my family's firsthand experience with bully doctors who balked at even the mildest questioning of the wisdom of the newborn hepatitis B immunization. When my husband and I asked if we could simply delay this particular shot, as the vaccine is for a virus that is contracted mostly through intravenous drug use and sexual contact, my son's pediatrician angrily kicked us out of her practice.

Does this informed skepticism make me and other like-minded parents public health menaces, as the World Health Organization has proclaimed? Are we ""sociopaths,"" as a journalist at The Atlantic once sneered? Apparently so.

At a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Washington state's public health secretary, John Wiesman, demanded that the feds launch a national campaign to counter ""anti-vaccine"" groups that are spreading what he condemned as ""false information."" Weisman called for increased funding from the Centers for Disease Control to combat opponents of the state's push to prevent parents from opting their children out of immunizations for personal or philosophical reasons. Health officials have blamed vaccine critics' social media influence for recent measles outbreaks. So Wiesman further urged Twitter, Facebook and Google to ""use whatever mechanism they have available to stop promoting pseudoscience.""

Let's be clear: Misinformation of all kinds abounds on the internet. The world's most influential ""mainstream"" media websites and celebrity social media accounts, for example, recklessly fanned the flames of the recent Covington Catholic High School and Jussie Smollett hate crime hoaxes. No one in Washington has called for the boycott of The Washington Post or TMZ over their false and misleading stories. But for some reason (hint: pharmaceutical big business), politicians and government bureaucrats are now hell-bent on deplatforming any and all dissenters who challenge mandatory vaccine regimens.

Under pressure from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Amazon pulled the documentaries ""Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,"" ""Man Made Epidemic"" and ""Shoot 'em Up: The Truth About Vaccines"" from its Prime Video streaming service. Last week, Google-owned YouTube moved to demonetize ""anti-vaccine"" channels, tweak algorithms to suppress vaccine ""conspiracy"" videos and combat ""vaccine hesitancy."" Pinterest blocks users from using the search terms ""vaccine,"" ""vaccinations"" and ""anti-vax,"" no matter the quality of the results. Facebook plans to downgrade vaccine skeptics' content on newsfeeds, recommended user groups and ads.

Is there junk science on the ""anti-vaccine"" side? Sure. But you can't address this issue without also addressing the problem with physicians and public health flacks who are unwilling to discuss the full risks of vaccines as well as their benefits; pro-vaccination groups that provide incorrect information about vaccines' duration of protection; physicians who refuse to care for children who are not ""fully"" vaccinated; and the comparative risk-benefit ratios of different vaccines.

As for efficacy, consider this new data: A recent whooping cough outbreak at the private Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles last week resulted in 30 students contracting the illness, all of whom were vaccinated. Of 18 unvaccinated students, none caught the disease. Will pointing this out on my Facebook and Twitter accounts bring down the Silicon Valley ban hammer?

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who happens to be a physician and parent himself, was the lone voice of dissent at the Senate hearing this week. While acknowledging that the benefits of vaccines generally outweigh their risks, he noted the plain truth that ""it is wrong to say there are no risks to vaccines."" He added that over $4 billion has been paid by the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for adults and children who have been injured or died as a result of receiving federally recommended childhood vaccines.

Is it unacceptable fearmongering to raise that point? How about to share information on vaccine manufacturers' astonishing exemption from product liability? Or to point parents to new research findings on brain injuries caused by vaccines, which can be found at VaccinePapers.org? Or to link them to a recent statement by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which ""strongly opposes federal interference in medical decisions, including mandated vaccines.""

When it comes to protecting our children, skepticism is always the best medicine. We need more free speech, not less. Those who seek to suppress debate and discussion in the name of the ""public good"" are the true health threats.

In the doc that premiered over the weekend, Wade Robson, 36, and James Safechuck, 40, allege Jackson sexually abused them when they were boys. Winfrey, who has previously opened up about also being molested as a child, says she wants their voices heard all over the world as she did not feel as brave to speak up when she was victimized by her cousin, an uncle and a family friend as a young girl, PEOPLE reports.

“It happened to me at 9, and then 10, and then 11, and then 12, 13, 14. You don’t have the language to begin to explain what’s happening to you,” Winfrey told PEOPLE for the March 12, 2018 cover story. “That’s why you feel you’re not going to be believed. And if the abuser, the molester, is any good, they will make you feel that you are complicit, that you were part of it. That’s what keeps you from telling.”

Winfrey’s special Oprah Winfrey Presents: After Neverland aired immediately following the documentary and featured the media maven supporting the alleged victims despite knowing she would be shrouded in hate from MJ loyalists.

The Wrinkle in Time star also credits the #MeToo movement for encouraging women to speak up about their own experiences with abusive males.

“Women all over the country have been in situations with domineering, brutish men and had to remain silent about it to keep food on the table,” Winfrey said before recalling the bully boss she used to work for at a TV station in Baltimore.

“I had a boss who was just a brute. This was at WJZ-TV in Baltimore. I knew that saying anything at the time would have taken me out of television forever. That nothing would have been done about it. I wasn’t going to be there forever, so I said nothing. Every time he would pass my desk, I would turn around and try to disappear.”"

Many people have been speaking out about the documentary, including Corey Feldman, who was a child actor when he and Jackson became friends in the 1980s.

Feldman, who is most known for the 1985 film “The Goonies” told Page Six he was never assaulted by Jackson.

“What happened with me [and Jackson] was strictly aboveboard,” Feldman said in the interview published Tuesday. “We’d be on the phone for hours. You’re talking about someone who has spent their life in the industry, who grew up in the industry and didn’t have a childhood and have friends and have sleepovers, I could relate. That was my life. We both came from abuse — abusive homes. There is not a lot of kindred minds that can connect on those levels or achieve the success he had. That was the common ground we shared.”

He continued, “I am not saying they are lying. I wasn’t there. I can only go based on my experiences. Every victim’s voice must be taken seriously and must be heard. In no way would I ever intimate that I would want them to be silenced.”

The 47-year-old added, “If God forbid these things were true, then there is a completely different Michael that I knew. I guess anything in the world of pedophilia is possible. All I can say is my heart goes out to both of them — and if for any reason the things are proven true, I would be in full support of them.”

That said, he explained, “I don’t think we can go jumping on a bandwagon without evidence. That’s why there are court cases and cross-examinations … when [Jackson] was on trial [ending in 2005], he was cleared of all the charges … I don’t think anyone can take [the allegations] lightly, but I also don’t think we should go making a judgment on information we have that’s strictly conversation without backup.”

Feldman blasted the parents.

“To me, the most shocking and appalling part of this whole thing are the actions and misdeeds made by the parents of both children, and the decision to allow their kids to be unaccompanied in the presence of an adult they did not know and trust,” Feldman said. “As a father, I could not ever imagine allowing my child to go off with a grown man I did not consider as close as family without any adult supervision. Not even Michael Jackson. It comes down to trading your kids out for an opportunity, and making them the focus of your financial interests, as opposed to the child’s wellbeing.”

Feldman did say he and Jackson slept in the same room, but the singer slept on a cot.

Feldman tweeted Monday that the documentary was more like “la la” land and that it was one-sided.

#Neverland OK I WATCHED IT ALL I KNOW IS WHAT I EXPERIENCED, & YES EVERY EXPERIENCE WAS THE SAME….RIGHT UP 2 THE SEX PART! THAT IS WHERE IT BECOMES LALA LAND, INSTEAD OF NEVERLAND 4 ME. WE NEVER SPOKE ABOUT SEX OTHER THAN A FEW WARNINGS ABOUT HOW SEX WAS SCARY, & DANGEROUS. MJ — Corey Feldman (@Corey_Feldman) March 4, 2019

HOWEVER I DO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE FACT THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS 1 SIDED W NO CHANCE OF A DEFENSE FROM A DEAD MAN, & NO EVIDENCE OTHER THAN THE WORD OF 2 MEN WHO AS ADULTS DEFENDED HIM IN COURT! BUT AS WE WILL NEVER REALLY KNOW, I ONLY HAV — Corey Feldman (@Corey_Feldman) March 4, 2019

According to TMZ, Brett Barnes, who knew Jackson when he was a child, threatened HBO with a lawsuit “claiming the documentary puts him in a false light and subjects him to ‘hatred, contempt and ridicule.’ Presumably, the lawyer is saying MJ supporters will target Barnes as a result of the documentary.”

Barnes testified at Jackson’s criminal trial in 2005 and said he was never assaulted by Jackson. He also tweeted this in January:

Not only do we have to deal with these lies, but we’ve also got to deal with people perpetuating these lies. The fact that they fail to do the small amount of research it takes to prove these are lies, by choice or not, makes it even worse. — Brett Barnes (@IAmBrettBarnes) January 30, 2019

In 1993, Jackson was accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy. In January of 1994, Jackson reportedly settled for $23,000,000. The accuser’s father committed suicide in 2009, five months after Jackson passed away. Jordan Chandler reportedly has never come forward about the allegations and supposedly lives outside of the country. In 2017, when choreographer Wade Robson accused Jackson of sexual assault—even though he’d said in the past the singer didn’t assault him—there was a hunt to find Chandler. According to The Daily Mail, he left the U.S. to avoid investigators.

In 2003, Jackson was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent to a 13-year-old boy. He was acquitted of all charges.

During the attack, he also stated that they had poured bleach on him and tied him up.

Just days later, two brothers, Abimbola (Abel) and Olabinjo (Ola) Osundairo were arrested in connection with the attack. However, it wasn’t long before the police began to suspect falsehood in Smollett’s story, and the Osundairo’s were released shortly afterward without any charges being pressed against them.

Since then, the story has blown up, with Smollett in the hot seat for allegedly staging his own attack for money and fame. Smollett has been arrested and is facing charges of making a false report to the police.

Celebrities have come down on both sides of the fence regarding the attack, with plenty of people slamming him for trying to incite racial hatred, while others have pledged their support. One such person on the latter end of the stick is Queen Latifah.

According to Fox News, Latifah has said she will be sticking by Smollett unless evidence of his guilt can be provided.

Queen Latifah stands by Jussie Smollett after alleged attack hoax https://t.co/i7Lo0D2hmn pic.twitter.com/rH4hpjUkxB — New York Post (@nypost) March 5, 2019

“The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet. And that’s just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof – which I haven’t seen yet – then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise,” she explained of her stance on the controversial matter.

Latifah is hopeful that “everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.”

So far, it looks unlikely that no one will be hurt by the incident. Smollett has already been removed from the last two episodes of Empire, although the studio seems hesitant at this point to cut ties completely with the actor.

Smollett’s co-stars have apparently expressed their wish that he be removed from the series completely, according to a previous report by The Inquisitr.

Smollett is believed to have paid the Osundairo brothers to attack him, and one bit of information the police have suggests that one of the brothers is actually the actor’s drug dealer. While the Osundairo’s seem to be free so long as they cooperate with the police investigation into Smollett, the actor had to take out a $100,000 bond to make bail."

Jackson, now a tweet has been unearthed by an actor on Disney's live-action The Lion King movie that sees Billy Eichner having stated he wants supporters of President Trump to ""burn in hell.""

The 40-year-old actor took to Twitter in January to blame Trump supporters for the attack on actor Jussie Smollett that turned out to be a hoax which Smollett himself perpetrated.

“Heartbroken and furious reading about the attack on Jussie Smollett. I want Trump and all MAGA lunatics to burn in Hell,"" The Lion King actor tweeted and then deleted.

A quick check of Eichner's Twitter also reveals him f-bombing and calling fans a b-tch.

Billy Eichner, who voices Timon in Jon Favreau's upcoming The Lion King, also continued his rant on MAGA supporters calling them ""a bunch of white supremacists..."" who embrace a ""racist, transphobic, misogynistic, xenophobic, pathologically lying President.""

Captain Marvel actor Samuel L. Jackson recently came under fire when he made comments comparing President Trump to a slave plantation owner, and also back in January he f-bombed the president numerous times.

Chuck Wendig was fired from Marvel Comics over similar tweets to Billy Eichner when he responded on Twitter to Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, which saw Wendig call Kavanaugh and Trump supporters a slur of expletives and also racists, rapists, abusers and more.

Last Summer saw Disney also fire director James Gunn from Marvel Studios and Guardians of the Galaxy 3 over tweets with the subject matter containing rape and pedophilia.

Shortly after James Gunn was fired, Star Wars: The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson proceeded to delete over 20k tweets.

Disney film chief Alan Horn recently commented on the company's policy toward social media which saw him call the various tweets ""so outrageous"" and that they better ""be careful.""

It should be said the chairman of Marvel and one of Disney's largest stockholders, Ike Perlmutter, is actually a good friend and supporter of President Trump, and is involved with Veteran Affairs, yet none of these celebrities have any issue working with Disney. Go figure, right?"

(CNSNews.com) – Candace Owens, director of communications at Turning Point USA and founder of the Blexit movement encouraging blacks to exit the Democratic Party, said Friday that she doesn’t want a Green New Deal, she wants a Black New Deal.



“I say I don’t want a Green new Deal. I want a black new deal. And the good news, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is that that actually can be free. It doesn’t cost $93 trillion,” Owens said in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).





“First and foremost, stop selling us our own oppression. Stop taking away our self confidence by telling us that we can’t because of racism, because of slavery. I’ve never been a slave in this country. Stop telling us that we need to be obsessing over our past when we should be obsessing over our future and the potential that we have,” she said.



“Stop having a culture which tells us that we should want to be hip hop artists and basketball players, when we should want to be doctors and lawyers. We need to stop idolizing people like LeBron James and start idolizing people like Dr. Condoleezza Rice and Dr. Ben Carson,” Owens said.



Owens explained her own decision to become a conservative two years ago.



“Two years ago, I thought that the left championed minority voices. I thought that the left championed women and always wanted to give us a platform, and then I publicly declared myself a conservative, and I found out the hard way that that’s not exactly true. If you’re a minority in this country, and you don’t subscribe to your emotions. If you want to have intellectual discussions, and you want to have a debate, there’s no place for you on the left. In fact, you will be rejected,” she said.



“In fact, they will actively try to destroy you in the way that they have tried to destroy me over the last two years. Many of you guys have followed my political transformation – obviously it started on YouTube with just an idea that maybe conservative principles might be an alternative for the black community,” Owens said.



She said she questioned how the left loved Donald Trump before he announced his candidacy for president and then hated him 24 hours later.



“I questioned at the time, is it really possible that a man that was loved by the media, Donald J. Trump – they loved him – loved by black America – every hip hop song that I listened to growing up, they wanted to be like Trump. Beyonce and Jay Z were sipping poolside at Mar-a-Lago. He was the dream. Obama said that the American dream was to be like Trump,” Owens said.



“Was it really possible that within 24 hours of declaring his candidacy for the White House, he became a racist, bigoted, homophobic, sexist rapist at one point, right? Was that really possible, and I said of course, no that’s it’s possible. There’s absolutely no way that’s possible,” she said.



Owens also questioned how the Democratic Party, which “instituted slavery, Jim Crow laws, racial terrorism in the KKK,” had the black vote.



“Then I started asking myself some other questions. How on earth is it possible that a party that instituted slavery, Jim Crow laws, racial terrorism in the KKK has the black vote. How is it possible? We gave up culture. The right gave up culture. That’s how the left was able to do this. We gave up culture. Over the course of the last 50 and 60 years, it seems that we’ve given up influencing pop culture altogether on the right, and to a certain degree, that’s completely understandable,” she said.



“There isn’t a climate that’s more hostile to conservative principles than the entertainment industry. We see that everywhere. We see that when Joy Behar mocks the vice president for being faithful to his wife – was that what he did? When she mocks the vice president for saying that he loves Jesus Christ, was that what he did?” Owens said.



She said liberalism has “infected” and “infested culture at every single layer.”



“The left never talks about policies, because their policies have failed black America for the last 60 years. The truth is that the left and the Democrats never, ever, ever want to fix black America, because they stump on our issues year after year,” Owens said.



“If they fixed our issues, they would have nothing to stump on or to talk about. They wouldn’t be able to just continually keep calling the other side racist. They want black America to stay broken. They don’t want us to ever have opportunities. They want to continue to give us handouts and not hand ups,” she said.



“Never in a million years did the left predict Donald J. Trump, and I’ll tell you what they also are not predicting. They never predicted a minority awakening. They never thought that they could ever lose the black vote ever. They’ve taken our vote for granted for so long, but things are starting to change,” Owens said, adding that it’s starting to change because the truth is on the side of conservatives.



“Truth number one, America is not a racist country. The people that continue to tell us that have a vested interest in racism. In fact, they’re actively now importing Nigerians to come do racist acts in this country a la Jussie Smollett, right? This is MAGA country? No, this is your prison cell, and I hope you rot in it, Jussie,” she said, referring to the “Empire” actor, who was accused of faking his own racist attack and charged with filing a police report.



“Truth number two, abortion is murder. I ask myself all the time, doesn’t it seem to you that progressive policies always lead to regressive results in the black community,” Owens said. She said black women represent six to seven percent of the population but 40 percent of all abortions performed in the U.S.



Owens also condemned Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for signing into law that allows late-term abortions up to nine months gestation.



“We have a sick and twisted Governor Andrew Cuomo celebrating that you can rip fetuses, you can rip infants and babies from their mother’s womb at nine months. It’s absolutely sickening what we’re talking about here. And who is that going to impact the most?” she said. “In New York City - for those of you that don’t know - more babies are aborted than born live.



“A hard-hitting truth is that the most unsafe place for a black child is not on the streets. It’s not when they see a police officer. It’s in their mother’s womb,” Owens said. She predicted that the black population would be double what is today if not for abortion.



“We’ve lost 18 million black babies since 1973. How’s that for a progressive policy. Is that what they’re celebrating? The left needs God,” she added.

“Truth number three, racially motivated police brutality is a myth. It’s simply a myth, but father absence is not. The number one issue facing black America is that fathers have been removed from the home. It’s that they have been incentivizing father absence,” Owens said.



“When the single motherhood rate jumps from 23 percent in the 1960s to a whopping 74 percent today, we have a problem. It’s a problem that the left does not want to talk about. It is the destruction and the breakdown of the family,” she said.



“Truth number four, there are 3.6 million black children living below the poverty line. There are 4 million Hispanic children that live below the poverty line, and yet Democrats want us to put illegals first. I say no thank you. I say build the wall,” Owens added."

Today Roberts reflected on the interview during an appearance at a daylong event put on by the Cut. Roberts says she had hesitation about the interview and admits she felt pressure not to go too hard on a fellow member of the LGBT community. From Page Six:

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,” she said during The Cut’s “How I Get It Done” event at 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge on Monday. “I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up,’” the “Good Morning America” host, 58, recalled. “And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”… “I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man,” she said. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.’” “It was a no-win situation for me,” she explained.

Roberts says she’d have loved to go after Smollett with the claims made by the Osundairo brothers but their allegations (that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack) didn’t break until days after the interview was filmed. From the Hollywood Reporter:

Responding to criticisms to her Smollett interview, including that she was too soft on the actor, Roberts admitted that she would have gone farther with her questioning of the actor if she’d had more of the details that eventually came to light before the segment aired. “It was hurtful, some of the things that were said. I’ll be honest,” said Roberts. “Because I pride myself on being fair. I know how much work went into being balanced about what to ask, to challenge him on certain things.” She added, “Had I had that information or what the brothers were alleging — heck, yeah, I would have asked that. But it aired that morning [and] we taped it two days ahead of time.”

I rewatched the interview. The Smollett portions are truly cringe-inducing in retrospect. However, just looking at Roberts’ questions, she does express some doubt about his story throughout the interview. Here are a few of her questions:

About the rope: “You hadn’t noticed it before?”

“Did you get any kind of description of the attackers?”

“Why did you hesitate to want to call the police?”

“The vast majority of people have been supportive and loving and understanding and then as time has gone on that there’s no—It’s two-o’clock in the morning, you’re going to Subway, sub-zero…”

“The phone. When did you—because as you said it was an accurate account of the timeline, valuable information. When did you make that information available to the police?”

Smollett says he didn’t want to hand over his phone. Roberts asks “Why?”

These aren’t bad questions given what Roberts knew the day this was filmed. It’s fair to say she was at least somewhat skeptical.

I think the problem with this segment overall is that, at the beginning and the end, Roberts allows Smollett to talk for several minutes about the attack and what it means. If Roberts had been a bit more skeptical, she wouldn’t have let him ramble in response to questions like, “What do you say to a young gay man?”

The worst question of the bunch is probably the last one: “If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal?” There are a lot of assumptions about who is telling the truth wrapped up in that question. Any sense of skepticism is gone. It’s another chance for Smollett to spin out his tearful story. Given that Roberts had reason to be skeptical, she probably should have saved the socio-cultural grand statements for a follow-up interview."

In a new interview on the Yahoo News show “Through Her Eyes,” the actress and singer explained why she’s not adding her voice to the court of public opinion, which has already decided Smollett is guilty.

“Until somebody can show me some proof otherwise, I’m going with him,” Queen Latifah told host Zainab Salbi. “The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet.”

The Grammy and Golden Globe winner appeared in a 2017 episode of Empire alongside Smollett, and she remains unconvinced that he conspired with two Nigerian-American brothers to orchestrate a racially-charged attack on himself on an icy-cold night early one morning late January in Chicago.

Smollett told Chicago police that he was attacked by two masked men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, wrapped a rope around his neck and doused him with bleach.

By mid-February, investigators announced that new evidence had “shifted” the case and Smollett was charged with filing a false report related to the alleged attack.

Queen Latifah, however, ain’t buying it.

“I hope everything works out in the end and basically everybody comes out unscathed,” she said.

Smollett, who maintains his innocence, was arrested and released last month after posting a $100,000 bond. He is due back in court March 14. In the meantime, he has been suspended from the rest of the season on Empire."

President Trump could have grabbed an interpreter, and he and Kim Jong-un could have ducked into a broom closet in Hanoi, just the three of them, and Trump could have said, ""Kim, old buddy, it's not working. We've got to put some whiskers on this thing!

""What we did in Singapore was much too dry, with staff assistants doing all the needlepoint of what we'd already agreed upon, leaving us looking like two cute little dolls atop the wedding cake.

""We need some drama, even if the drama is trauma.""

And thus, in a world fascinated by ""the tallest midget"" or ""the least-known celebrity,"" was born the most successful failure in the history of summitry!

Do you remember how Jussie Smollett instructed his Nigerian collaborators to beat him up, but not too badly? There was a lot of that ""parting is such sweet sorrow"" in the grand ""failure"" in Hanoi. Note the absence of any acrimony, suggesting a friendly divorce. Both sides wanted the world to know the doors are far from slammed and locked but rather shut just ever so slightly.

""Sometimes you just have to walk,"" declared President Trump, alluding to what he's always said is a big part of ""The Art of the Deal"" and the essence of negotiating from a position of power, namely, being prepared to walk away. ""I feel bad for Kim, I really do."" And it sounded like he really did!

And did you see those North Koreans jump up and demand that the world pay attention to their hastily called press conference, so they could tell everybody that the Americans got it all wrong, because North Korea was calling for only half the sanctions to be lifted, not all?

And that's progress! Even the mere fact that Kim Jong-un was moved to travel outside his Hermit Kingdom to attend his summit conference with Trump is a strong indication that Trump's diplomacy, in contrast to that of the previous several administrations, has already wrought significant change on the North Korean dynasty of dictatorship and belligerence that goes back to Stalin's time.

And yet, the Democrats and their usual gang of talking heads and sympathetic pundits are predictably marching in lockstep, only too eager to condemn Trump as an abject failure at diplomatic negotiation.

I'm reminded of a joke that's told about Alexander the Great, Napoleon and Richard Nixon meeting up in the afterlife. And they're talking about how differently they might have fared in today's world.

""If I'd had just few tanks instead of elephants,"" says Alexander, ""I could have truly conquered the world!""

""And if I'd had just a few of those helicopter gunships,"" Napoleon says, ""just think how I could have turned the tide at Waterloo!""

And Nixon says, ""And if I'd had the media so totally in my pocket and committed to me the way they are today totally committed to advancing the Democratic agenda and to destroying Trump, nobody would have ever heard of Watergate!"""
