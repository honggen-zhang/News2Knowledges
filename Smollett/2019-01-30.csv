Chicago PD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter on Wednesday that detectives had “located a surveillance camera that shows potential persons of interest wanted for questioning in reference to the assault & battery of Empire actor.”

The news follows several agencies scouring the city now the throes of the Polar Vortex for video footage of the attack, which occurred in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Police has been looking for a pair of suspects.

Local law enforcement tells Deadline “this looks like a pretty good lead.”

Later this evening Guglielmi tweeted out photos of the aforementioned “people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member.” He adds, “While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.”

20th Century Fox shut down production on the Chicago-set Empire among other Windy City productions because of the record cold temperatures of the Polar Vortex sweeping through the Midwest. The shutdown occurs as cast, creators and producers are still trying to process the attack on Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon.

According to reports, the actor was exiting a Subway restaurant in the 300 block of East Lower Water Street early Tuesday morning when two suspects began yelling racial and homophobic slurs towards him. They then proceeded to attack Smollett, punching him before pouring an unknown chemical substance over him. At some point during the attack, one of the suspects wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck. The attackers then fled the scene.

Smollett eventually drove himself to Northwestern Hospital and was in good condition later Tuesday, police said.

As Deadline reported, depending on his recovery and weather conditions, Smollett could be back filming Empire by early next week."

Many cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Seattle and San Francisco saw the highest number of hate crimes in a decade, and cities such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Philadelphia saw pronounced increases in the second half of the year, particularly around the time of the November mid-term elections.

In Los Angeles, hate crimes rose by 13 percent in 2018 compared to 2017. New York saw a 6 percent increase while Chicago and Houston saw 26 percent and 173 percent spikes respectively. In New York, the Jewish community was the most targeted.

While Los Angeles, New York and Chicago saw declines in crime overall, hate crimes rose.

In Los Angeles members of the LGBT community, African Americans and Jews were the most frequent hate crime targets in 2018, the report said.

Jussie Smollett attack

This report comes out a day after news that Chicago police have opened a hate crime investigation after Jussie Smollett, a cast member of the television show “Empire,” was attacked by men who he said shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him as they physically attacked him.

The 36-year-old actor, who is gay and African American, was hospitalized after the Jan. 29 attack in downtown Chicago. Chicago police said the men struck Smolett in the face, poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around his neck while yelling out “MAGA country” during the assault.

The ongoing increases in hate crimes in the nation’s largest cities may be attributed to demographic changes and political polarization, said Brian Levin, the center’s director.

“Interestingly, we noticed that in cities like Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia, hate crimes spiked around the time of the (mid-term) elections in November,” he said. “These numbers show that we really have to work on creating a more respectful, tolerant landscape where we can engage in civil political discourse.”

Levin attributed the dramatic increases in hate crimes in Houston and the rest of Texas to significant improvements in reporting.

“But, for the most part, we’ve seen an increase in political conflict, which blows over to violence, and particularly, hate crime violence,” he said.

‘Democratization of hate’

The report notes that in Los Angeles, a majority of hate crimes targeted members of the LGBT community (73) followed by African Americans (61), Jews (14), Caucasians (12) and Latinos (7).

Levin said Los Angeles County also saw “a democratization of hate” where many of the perpetrators of hate crimes were non-white.

“That’s not to minimize the fact the African Americans were among the most targeted groups,” he said. “But, in Los Angeles County, in particular, we did see a larger number of hate crimes where non-whites were perpetrators of hate crimes.”"

While walking to a Subway in Chicago, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the 36-year-old actor after he exited the restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They punched him, allegedly poured bleach on him and one of the suspects also put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

“The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric,” the NAACP said in a statement. “It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse. As this rhetoric continues to bleed into our everyday lives, dangerous behavior will continue to place many law abiding individuals at risk.”

Threatening letters directed at Smollett were reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago 9 days ago. The cutout letters said, “You will die black f**.” See below:

The Toronto man who was arrested last year for the deaths of several gay men has plead guilty to eight counts of first degree murder.

According to The Washington Post, Bruce McArthur confessed on Tuesday to murdering Selim Esen, Andrew Kinsman, Majeed Kayhan, Dean Lisowick, Soroush Mahmudi, Skandaraj Navaratnam, Abdulbasir Faizi, and Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam (pictured above, not in order) between 2010 and 2017.

Court records claim McArthur met many of his victims at gay night clubs and bars in Toronto and describe most of his killings as “sexual in nature.”

Navaratnam was the first to go missing in 2010.

As more gay men began to disappear over the next few years, Toronto’s LGBTQ community started to fear someone was targeting the city’s gay population. Unfortunately, they were right.

In January 2018, Toronto police announced McArthur had been charged with the murders of five men. The arrest came after authorities found dismembered skeletal remains of three victims “hidden at the bottom of planters” at a home the 67-year-old used as storage for his landscaping business.

Investigators have since linked the former mall Santa to three more victims: Navaratnam, Faizi, and Kanagaratnam. Several of McArthur’s victims were still closeted, and most were refugees or recent immigrants from South Asia and the Middle East.

Each count of murder carries an automatic life sentence for McArthur. A sentencing hearing will take place next week.

While relieved the serial killer is behind bars, the local LGBT community remains unnerved as to how he was able to get away with it for so long. Police have been criticized for not taking the killings seriously until Kinsman, a white man McArthur was said to be in a relationship with, disappeared in 2017.

Our hearts go out to the victims’ families and the Toronto LGBT community.

Their well-wishes have an offputting tone because in the “interview” DeGeneres basically characterized Hart’s critics as “haters” and Hart offered a “sorry if you were offended” non-apology accompanied by blaming the gay community for unearthing his homophobic tweets, to begin with.

It was especially painful watching Ellen absolve Kevin because we love Ellen and want to love Kevin: She’s a longtime equality champion, a role model and our direct line to middle America. Her disarming, kind-hearted sense of humour makes her an effective advocate. Hart is insanely talented and could change the world for the better if he wanted.

Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show. I’m sending him and his family so much love today. ?? — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 29, 2019

Many blasted the duo for the unearned love-fest, leaving most wonder why DeGeneres would essentially serve as Hart’s publicist/apologist. Who appointed her to that post? It wasn’t just that she used her gay celeb cred to forgive him for his refusal not just to apologize fully. She also didn’t even bother to ask him to take responsibility for what he did. Apologies don’t mean much without action, and Hart hasn’t actually done anything substantial to make up for his past hateful comments.

Really inserting your show here? It’s just sad. What about the guy who joked about beating his kid if they were gay that you forgave for all of us? Jokes like that make this type of violence possible. You’re part of the problem Ellen — Judah Robinson (@judah_robinson) January 30, 2019

So, as a black comedian who joked about beating a kid for being gay and a gay talk show host for forgave him for it without him actually atoning for it, their “prayers” and “love” come off as equally showy and insubstantial. But it didn’t have to be this way. Their conversation could have made real in-roads to help make their comments today land with grace and gravity.

Forgiveness is a good thing, of course. But DeGeneres forgave Hart without first establishing that he actually realized the gravity of what he’d said, sometimes resorting to putting words in his mouth that he could not master himself.

Related: Ellen and Kevin Hart are getting torn apart on Twitter for Jussie Smollett Tweets

“I think it’s perfect that all of this has happened because there has to be conservation about homophobia,” he announced on Hart’s behalf. “And whoever’s trying to hurt you, it brought up you reminding people that you’re a bigger person, that you’ve already apologized — you’re apologizing again.”

As Hart nodded, Ellen continued: “As a gay person … I’m sensitive to all of that and I’ve talked to you about [homophobia] and you’ve already expressed that it’s only not being educated on the subject, not realizing how dangerous those words are, not realizing how many kids are killed for being gay or beaten up every day. You have grown. You have apologized. You’re apologizing again right now. You’ve done it. Don’t let those people win — host the Oscars.”

DeGeneres, perhaps more than any other gay celebrity, understands the consequence of homophobia. She came out in Time magazine on April 14, 1997, and again on her TV sitcom 16 days later. When ABC cancelled her show later that season, she blamed it on her coming out and not the ratings.

After their interview aired, Deray McKesson of Pod Save America called Hart’s appearance “one long monologue from Kevin interspersed with Ellen’s approval.” Gay comedian Louis Virtel called it “a hostile retelling of how [the gay community] didn’t hear [Hart’s] meagre apology the first time.”

Out magazine said that DeGeneres didn’t deserve to forgive Hart because as a popular black entertainer his words impacted queers of color most. The Huffington Post called it “Artificial Talk-Show Culture At Its Worst.” And an Advocate headline said it all: Ellen DeGeneres Does Not Speak for the LGBTQ Community on Kevin Hart.

At any rate, the backlash to DeGeneres and Hart’s well-wishes to Smollett got us to thinking about things we wish DeGeneres had actually discussed with Hart — conversations that might’ve shed more light on homophobia and everyone’s role in it. We can’t really ask Ellen to be a journalist, that’s not her gig, but that doesn’t mean she can’t ask some hard questions.

Instead of piling on, here are five things we wish DeGeneres had talked with Hart about instead, questions that would have forced him to grapple with homophobia, especially targeting the black queer community, rather than elude responsibility.

1. What do you think is the cause of the spike in hate crimes?

Hate crimes have been increasing since 2016, and bullying remains a perennial problem among youth. Familial queerphobia contributes to 40% of the homelessness among youth.

Hart and DeGeneres’ middle American viewers might not know these facts, and they help contextualize why advocates responded so strongly to Hart’s casual use of anti-gay slurs and physical threats. In a 2011 tweet, Hart wrote, “Yo if my son comes home & try’s 2 play with my daughter’s doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay.'”

It would’ve been telling to see whether Hart expressed empathy or merely shrugged off the stats as unfortunate. It also would’ve been awesome to know whether he felt he could affect change in this area — and it still would be!

Understanding the connection between homophobia and violence would help demonstrate that Hart gets it and it would make his well-wishes to Smollett feel more substantial and affirming.

2. Why it would be wrong to apologize more than once for the things you’ve said?

Perhaps the biggest letdown from Hart during his interview was his explanation that he didn’t want to apologize for his past comments because he’d already done so in the past, and the way Ellen let this slide. (By the way, Vulture investigated his claim and found no such apology anywhere.)

DeGeneres could’ve helped Hart see the foolishness of digging his heels in: It doesn’t take that much courage to sincerely apologize without qualifications, blaming others or self-recrimination, and it does so much to heal others–not to mention yourself. In fact, why not going on an entire apology/listening tour? It’s certainly been done before.

This question would’ve cut to the quick of Hart’s refusal and perhaps helped him see that anything worth saying once is worth repeating, especially if those most affected didn’t hear you the first time. It might’ve also served as a good example for future celebs who get caught making careless homophobic jibes and how they can respond compassionately to victims of homophobic violence.

3. What do you think about Billy Porter’s comments about you?

Porter tweeted that this isn’t about Hart’s right to tell “jokes,” but rather about his inability to understand the comparison between homophobia and the injustice of racism.

DeGeneres might have hesitated to ask Hart about Porter’s quote, both because Porter said “F you” and because celebrity beefs just aren’t on-brand for her.

Yet there must have been a way to bring this up. It would’ve been nice to see if Hart understands the similarity between black and gay Americans who’re both fighting for equality and against violence and discrimination. The black queer community literally embodies this fight. Which group is the most victimized in the country right now? Black trans women, who are subjected to violence and harassment at an alarming rate.

Here’s an idea, Kevin and Ellen. Sit down the quietly decent and courageous basketball star Reggie Bullock, who tattooed the likeness of trans sister, Mia Henderson, who was murdered 2014. Bullock, who is straight and African-American, could tell you everything you need to know about the intersection of racial and gender bigotries that killed his sister and devastated his own family.

This conversation would’ve brilliantly set the stage for both to address the racist, queerphobic attack on Smollett while making space for other black celebrities to weigh in on how homophobia intersects with race.

4. How would you have liked the community to handle this?

Hart initially told people complaining about his past comments to “Stop looking for reasons to be negative.” Then, during his DeGeneres interview, talked as if there were a vast conspiracy to destroy his entire professional career. Right.

But considering that GLAAD said it reached out to Hart to start a conversation, we’re curious: How would he have preferred this entire thing to be handled?

This isn’t a mere “gotcha” question: It could shed light on ways a possible ally would like to be handled — useful information for the next time a celeb gets caught making awful comments or “jokes.”

5. What could you do concretely as a popular public figure to make a difference?

Most recently, Hart told listeners of his Sirius XM radio show that it’s not his “life’s dream” to be an LGBTQ ally. That’s fine, actually. No one expected Hart to marshal a Pride parade or become executive director of the Human Rights Campaign.

But a donation, a PSA or a little time working with youth could’ve made for great press and a learning opportunity for why words matter. In fact, it’d be great to see him make a contribution, especially in light of Smollett’s attack. Giving his time and/or money to an anti-violence organization would show that he “gets it” and wants to make a positive impact if even just as a one-time thing.

A great alternate question could’ve been about what Hart might’ve said at the Oscars to address the issue. It’s an opportunity he’ll likely never get. But telling us how he could’ve used the opportunity would show us he cares about people less fortunate than he while reminding the world of his talent as a showman.

All of these conversations would’ve helped DeGeneres give Hart an opportunity to upright his public image and start dialogue in the right direction. For both entertainers, it’s not too late to still have these conversations, especially in light of Smollett’s assault."

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood, spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Neither Smollett nor his publicist has spoken publicly about the attack.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. The 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment today.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

Terrence Howard is the latest “Empire” co-star to speak out about the attack. Sitting down with “Good Morning America”, the 49-year-old reveals that he and the rest of the “Empire” cast found out about the hate crime while on set, saying that “jaws dropped to the ground.”

“When we had learned that there had been letters that had been sent to Fox as threats about the potential of something like this, then we became much more frightened.”

The actor’s comments come less than 24 hours after Smollett, who portrays his son on “Empire”, was discharged from the hospital after suffering injuries caused by two unknown offenders who yelled out racial and homophobic slurs. The assailants battered him in his face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

At some point during the incident, one of the offenders allegedly wrapped a rope around the 35-year-old’s neck before fleeing the scene.

“I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,” Howard explains. “But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t — and we cannot — forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

“Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood,” Howard adds. “He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap.

CHICAGO -- Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said, noting that the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

“We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn't find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said.

It looks like police are finally making progress in tracking down the people responsible for the racist, homophobic attack against Jussie Smollett.

According to TMZ, investigators have captured multiple persons of interest on surveillance video and plan to release photos to the public in an effort to bring them in for questioning.

While they didn’t refer to the individuals as “suspects,” they plan to release the images soon.

REPORT: ‘Empire’ star Jussie Smollett hospitalized after MAGA supporters beat him and put noose around his neck “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*gger’

The Empire actor and singer was brutally beaten by two men wearing ski masks in Chicago early Tuesday morning. They reportedly doused the openly gay actor with bleach and tied a noose around his neck while shouting “MAGA country.”

According to the reports, Smollett was walking out of Subway when someone yelled “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n*****?” before attacking him.

OPINION: The vicious homophobic and racist attack on Jussie Smollett shows the terrifying danger of MAGA thinking

According to That Grape Juice, Fox Studios received hate mail earlier this month targeted to the 36-year-old actor. Cut out letters from magazines spelled out “You will die black f**.”

The Chicago Police Department issued a statement on the incident:

“A 36-year-old man was walking at above address when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him. The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene. The victim self-transported to Northwestern Hospital and is in good condition. Area Central Detectives are investigating.”"

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Thursday that detectives have recovered surveillance-camera footage of ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett arriving home at his apartment with a rope around his neck. He said the video was recorded minutes after the actor said he was attacked by two masked men. Investigators still have still have not managed to locate footage of the assault itself.

Guglielmi added that when officers arrived at Smollett's apartment, he still had the rope around his neck and cuts and scrapes on his face.

The attack on Smollett, which occurred in the early hours of Tuesday morning, is being investigated as a ""possible hate crime."" The actor said his attackers poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him, and used racial and homophobic slurs. (Smollett, who is black and gay, later told police his assailants yelled, ""This is MAGA country!"" during the incident.)

Earlier, Guglielmi revealed that Smollett was on the phone with his manager around 2 a.m. CST Tuesday, when he was approached by his attackers. However, he said the actor had declined to hand over his cellphone records to investigators.

The spokesman noted that the abundance of surveillance camera footage in the Streeterville neighborhood has been had been both a help and a hindrance. He expressed hope that detectives would be able to piece them together to capture most, if not all, of Smollett’s trip from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at about 2 a.m. CST Tuesday, when Smollett said the attack occurred. But he also said investigators had been stymied by the fact that the timestamps from the various public and private surveillance cameras are not synchronized.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

On Wednesday, the police had their first break in the case, compiling enough video to release several images of ""potential persons of interest.""

In a tweet that night, Guglielmi described the images as ""photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member."" He added, ""While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.""

The actor/singer, 36, has since left Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was treated for cuts to his face and neck, and still plans to perform a previously scheduled concert in Los Angeles this weekend.

A person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it confirmed Smollett's performance plans to USA TODAY.

Smollett's representative, Pamela Sharp, told USA TODAY that he was ""recovering well.""

""Empire,"" which shoots in Chicago, was scheduled to resume shooting Thursday after pausing production for a few days due to the record cold temperatures there.

Guglielmi told USA TODAY that detectives made physical contact with Smollett outside of the ER Tuesday and were again in contact with him on Wednesday. Together, they have compiled a timeline of the incident.

Officers have combed through ""hundreds of hours of video"" from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area, Guglielmi said. But he said they still need to collect and view more.

""We ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com,"" police said.

On Wednesday, Bobby Rush, the Chicago congressman who introduced H.R. 35, a bill that would make lynching a federal crime, tweeted that he had contacted FBI director Christopher Wray to ask for ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack"" on Smollett.

In a statement, he called the attack ""a hate crime plain and simple"" and vowed not to ""stand by while evil acts are inflicted on any citizen, especially not in my hometown.""

President Donald Trump also commented on the attack when responding to reporters Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. I think that's horrible,"" he said. ""It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.""

CPD Officer Michael Carroll confirmed to USA TODAY that the FBI is investigating a threatening letter containing a white substance that was sent to Smollett at Fox's Chicago studios on Jan. 22. The powder was later determined to be acetaminophen, or Tylenol.

Smollett’s music manager also confirmed that he was on the phone with the actor at the time he was attacked in Chicago early on Tuesday morning, and that he heard some of what transpired.

The manager, Brandon Z. Moore, told Variety that he gave his account to police authorities, but declined to go into details because it is an active investigation.

The attack is being characterized as a possible hate crime, and involved two men yelling out “racial and homophobic slurs” at Smollett, pouring an “unknown chemical substance” on him, and wrapping a rope around his neck, according to the Chicago Police Department. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett also told investigators that he heard attackers shout “MAGA country.” MAGA stands for Make America Great Again, President Trump’s campaign slogan.

Moore told Variety that he heard those words being used. “I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,” he said.

Guglielmi said that Smollett recalled the use of the ‘MAGA country” phrase “to detectives during their initial followup investigation. They were not made initially to responding officers but detectives completed a supplemental report with the updated information.”

Smollett transported himself to Northwestern University hospital and was listed in good condition.

According to ABC News, an earlier threat had been made in letter form to Smollett prior to Tuesday, and that investigation has now been handed over to the FBI.

The incident drew widespread condemnation in Hollywood as well as from a number of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who is running for president, wrote on Twitter that Smollett “is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

A potential 2020 presidential contender, former Vice President Joseph Biden, wrote that “what happened today to @ JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.”

Smollett’s upcoming Saturday concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood has not been canceled, though details are still being determined."

Authorities say Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital in Chicago following the attack and is in “good condition,” according to CNN. If you’ve been following the news about Smollett’s situation, most likely the details have been really difficult to read. The nature of Smollett’s attack was severe, and hearing about a brutal attack like this can be flat-out scary. If you’re feeling triggered by the news about the attack, you’re not alone. There are some ways you can care for yourself in the days to come that will help you get through.

""Even if you weren't in a dark place, sometimes hearing other people's stories can bring you to a dark place,” Celeste Viciere, licensed mental health counselor and host of Celeste The Therapist Podcast, previously told Bustle for a separate article on managing triggering news. It's super important to remember that feeling triggered doesn't mean you're making Smollett's situation all about you. Triggers are 100 percent real, and it's very important to listen to your body and to take care of yourself.

“The truth is, you can't avoid all [the news], so it can be helpful to try to think now about strategies that can help you if you get caught up or caught off guard by these stories,"" Lena Solow said in an article for Teen Vogue. Solow was referring to feeling triggered by the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, but the advice is solid for any news that can be triggering. ""What makes you feel grounded? Maybe you need to remember to take deep breaths and take stock of your current surroundings — think about what you can see, hear, and feel right now. Remind yourself that you are safe. Drink some water. Maybe you have some friends who you know get it, who you can text.”

News about the attack could trigger memories, emotions, or even some bodily sensations that you might not expect, like a racing heart, muscle tension, or headaches, according to VeryWellMind. If you’re feeling really triggered right now, VeryWellMind says the best thing you can do for yourself is to avoid what’s triggering you altogether. That means stepping away from the news — turn off the TV, avoid social media if you have to, ask your friends not to talk about the attack around you. Wait until you’re ready to start hearing about it again to get updates on the situation.

If you can’t avoid the news, there are still other ways you can manage feeling triggered. A 2017 study published in the Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience found that practicing mindfulness meditation helps people with PTSD restore connectivity within their brain networks. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs supports this, saying that practicing mindfulness has been effective in helping people manage anxiety and symptoms associated with feeling triggered, such as avoidance and hyper-arousal. And practicing mindfulness doesn't need to be a major affair; it can be as simple as sitting down and focusing on the inhale and exhale of your breathing, says the V.A.

Asier Romero

Getting some exercise or some physical activity can also help you if you're feeling triggered or a little depressed right now. In fact, a new study found that getting up and moving, even if its taking a short walk, is good for your mental health. But if your feelings are getting really intense or you're having suicidal thoughts, it’s totally OK to reach out to a close friend, a loved one, or just someone you trust. If you need help right away, you can also contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or text ""HOME"" to the Crisis Text Line at 741741.

What happened to Smollett is a horrific act that should never happen to anyone, and it's understandable if you're feeling scared, confused, or depressed about it. Just remember it's totally fine to take some time for yourself to make sure you're doing OK.

If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to the Crisis Text Line at 741741. You can also reach out to the Trans Lifeline at 877-565-8860 or the Trevor Lifeline at 1-866-488-7386, or to your local suicide crisis center."

Henson supported Jussie Smollett, her costar and TV son, with a powerful post shared on Instagram. Her message follows the Tuesday, Jan. 29 attack on Smollett in Chicago, which police called a ""possible hate crime"" in a statement released the same day. Alongside a video of Smollett's political protest anthem ""F.U.W."", Henson wrote a lengthy reaction sending love his way, all while declaring hate will never win.

Henson's Instagram post began,

""I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now. @jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.""

Henson also commented on Smollett's song and video accompanying her message by declaring how much ""F.U.W."" should be downloaded now more than ever and ""until it goes triple platinum because the message is NEEDED."" She continued,

""#weareresilientpeople AND #weaintgoingnowhereuntillwearefinished. The love so many have him just goes to show HE IS LOVE!!!! I LOVE YOU MY BABY MY BABY!!! #LOVEWINSALWAYS.""

Smollett released ""F.U.W."" in 2017 and it serves as a response to Donald Trump's administration and the hate many marginalized communities continue to face. Smollett told the Associated Press, ""This song is for the oppressed. That's why I feel like people will connect with it because it is very broad, because oppression is so broad.""

The video also features a Trump mask and someone running over it with a wheelchair, which Smollett explained as a ""representation of this false idea of patriotism."" He later said, ""It's our opportunity to take those masks off and shatter them, so that's what I did.""

As reported on Jan. 29, Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two unknown assailants, who allegedly beat the actor with their hands and poured an ""unknown chemical"" on him, according to a Chicago Police Department statement shared by HuffPost's Front Page Editor, Philip Lewis. The assailants also allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs during the attack, according to the statement.

At the time of the report regarding Smollett's attack, Bustle reached out to his reps for comment, but did not receive an immediate response. Smollett also told police in a follow-up interview that the attackers yelled ""MAGA country"" during the assault, according to ABC News.

Smollett's other Empire costar and TV father, Terrence Howard, reacted to the news on Wednesday, Jan. 30, on Good Morning America. He said of Smollett,

""I heard he's getting better. He’s angry, but I know Jussie. Jussie's anger will dissipate, and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.""

Howard also stated, ""They were all in shock that our family, the Fox family, the Empire family, the Lyon family was attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.""

It's clear that Smollett has support from those closest to him, including his Empire family."

Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon in TV drama Empire, is understood to have been set upon by two people who shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him.

He was beaten and had an unknown substance thrown over him when he was attacked. Chicago Police also reported that the actor had a rope wrapped around his neck during the incident.

Days before the attack, he was sent an abusive letter that used cut out letters to spell out the message: “You will die black f**.”

The hate mail was sent to the Fox studios in Chicago where the TV show Empire is filmed.

The Chicago Police department are working to identify the people behind the hate crime attack on the actor. It is understood that they wore ski masks and asked him: “Aren’t you that f***** Empire n*****?” and shouted: “This is MAGA country”, a reference to president Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan.

In a statement, the Chicago Police Department said: “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.

“Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators.”

Stars are speaking out to show their support of the 35-year-old and condemn his attackers.

Viola Davis wrote on Instagram: “OMG! This is why the LGBTQ community continue to fight to be seen and protected against hate!

We all have to take this racist and homophobic act of violence very personally! My arms are around you Jussie Smollett. You are loved!”

Janelle Monae also used Instagram to share a heartfelt message in response to the news.

“This hate crime against our brother Jussie Smollett is proof that no matter how famous you may be it still does not protect you from vicious racist homophobes !! AND It is still a risk daily to be a black, out, and proud human being. I am sending so much love to you Jussie . Praying for your healing. Thank you for being such an inspiration to me and so many people. Thank you for inspiring us to walk in our truth. Thank you for choosing freedom over fear. I will continue to walk bold, black, and proud in your honor [sic] always. With love from your bi/pan/free ass motha***** sis. This pic is of me thanking him for sending flowers after the RS article (which gave me great anxiety btw). What a kind, kind, kind soul,” she wrote.

Smollett, who announced he was gay on TV in 2015, has not spoken publicly of the attack as of yet.

He was hospitalised after the attack but has since been released."

Police officials say detectives are looking to identify and interview the people captured on camera to find out if they were involved in the reported attack or witnessed it. Police aren’t yet calling them suspects as detectives continue to investigate Tuesday’s brutal incident as a hate crime.

The two low-quality images appear to show two people wearing all black clothing, matching the description of the attackers given to police by Smollett. Police say they were walking on New Street near Illinois Street between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. Smollett told officers the attack happened at 2 a.m. about one block away. Not much else can be determined from the photos.

“While the video footage does not depict an assault, the individuals pictured are seen in the vicinity of the alleged criminal incident during the alleged time of occurrence,” said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. “Detectives are taking this investigation seriously and urging anyone with any information on the identity of these individuals to contact Area Central detectives.”

Though no video was released of the attack or the events leading up to it, Guglielmi said detectives have pieced together video showing the two persons of interest walking in the same direction as Smollett about the same time he was in the area.

“They could have been the perpetrators, they could have been witnesses, they could have been complete bystanders who didn’t see the incident at all,” Guglielmi said. “There are still a lot more cameras that we have to look at. It’s almost like a digital puzzle. You have to put all of those pieces together and kind of watch them at the same time.”

Until Wednesday evening, police had said detectives did not have enough information to release a description of the attackers despite reviewing hundreds of hours of video from the surrounding area.

Smollett was reportedly attacked around 2 a.m. Tuesday as he was walking back to an apartment after a late-night meal at a Subway restaurant at 511 N. McClurg Court, police said.

Two men indicated they recognized Smollet and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at Smollett in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street, before they hit him in the face, poured what is suspected to be bleach on him and put a rope around his neck, Smollett told police.

After describing the attackers as men wearing ski-masks and all black clothing in an initial report filed with police, Smollett told detectives in a follow-up interview that the men yelled “this is MAGA country” after they assaulted him.

Smollett was talking to his agent on the phone when the attack started, Guglielmi said. Detectives could not “independently verify” that claim because neither man wanted to turn over their cell phones. But police have no reason to doubt the story, according to Guglielmi.

The manager, identified in news reports as Brandon Moore, told Variety Wednesday that he heard the racial slurs and the “MAGA” quote.

“I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,” he said.

Smollett was treated for lacerations to his face and neck at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and later released.

The block where the attack took place has parking garage entrances but no retail businesses. Police recovered video from various business, residential and police cameras in the wider area, but none until Wednesday showed any possible suspects. Surveillance camera at the Subway shows Smollett at the restaurant.

More than a dozen police detectives, some specializing in hate crimes, are working the case. They asked anyone who has information or witnessed the attack to call detectives at (312) 747-8382 or submit an anonymous tip at cpdtip.com.

Congressman Bobby Rush on Wednesday wrote a letter to the FBI asking the bureau to open a hate crime investigation into the attack.

“As you are aware, crimes of this nature strike fear at the very core of a community and have a long-lasting impact on its members,” Rush wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray. “They are, therefore, rightfully characterized as hate crimes.”

The FBI is already investigating a letter sent on Jan. 22 to Fox and “Empire” offices that used “threatening language” toward Smollett, police said. The letter was laced with some type of white, powdery substance, according to a police spokesman.

A celebrity website, thatgrapejuice.net, published a picture of the letter with the words, “You will die black f–,” written in letters apparently cut from magazines.

The FBI has declined to comment on the case.

Activist Andrew Holmes offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in Smollett’s attack. Holmes said confidential tips can be called in at (800) 883-5587."

Police found footage of potential people of interest involved in the alleged attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett.

“Police detectives have located surveillance cameras that show potential people of interest in the alleged assault and battery that was reported in the 300 block of E. North Water Street,“ Chicago Police told Page Six on Wednesday. “While the video footage does not depict an assault, the individuals pictured are seen in the vicinity of the alleged criminal incident during the alleged time of occurence.“

The actor was allegedly attacked in Chicago early Tuesday morning and will travel to Los Angeles to perform on Saturday.

The “Empire” star is currently home recovering after the alleged attack. Smollett has told police he was beaten after visiting a Subway restaurant.

“Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” according to police.

They then “began to batter [him] with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim” while “one of the offenders wrapped a rope around” his neck before fleeing the scene, cops said.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tells PEOPLE police are widening their search of surveillance cameras — both public and private — in the area surrounding the sight of the alleged attack by two black-clad, masked men in the city’s Streeterville section near Smollett’s home.

“We are looking for more cameras to review footage from because we haven’t been able to find any cameras that have been of use to us, that documented the assault,” Guglielmi explains. “But these young men had to drive in from somewhere…they had to walk in from somewhere.”

He adds: “If and when this occurred, we will find some kind of digital evidence of it. We have the largest private surveillance network in the country with 3,500 cameras citywide. That particular area’s saturated with our cameras as well as private cameras and red light cameras. If someone drove into this area, we will find them. It takes time to go through all the footage.”

Guglielmi revealed new details about the attack to PEOPLE Wednesday, saying Smollett was targeted on his way home from a Subway, where he’d gone for a late night snack following his flight back to Chicago from New York.

“The victim goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men,” Guglielmi says. “They were masked and wearing black clothing. They called him an Empire … and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.”

Guglielmi says the actor returned to his apartment afterwards, and call his manager, who quickly made is way to Smollett’s home. “The manager goes to the apartment, and they agree to call police,” the spokesman says. “The manager called us at 2:40 a.m.”

Police patrols “responded to the residence to take a report and the victim was still wearing the rope around his neck when they arrived,” Guglielmi says. “He explained to them why he had the rope around his neck, and the officers closed their body cams at his request, because they were in his private residence.”

Hours after that initial interview, Guglielmi says Smollett was interviewed a second time, and informed police his attackers told him he was in “MAGA country” before fleeing on foot — a reference to President Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

FBI Investigating Alleged Threatening Letter to Smollett

The attack on Smollett comes after additional security was hired for the Empire set after Fox Studios’ Chicago offices allegedly received a threatening homophobic letter addressed to the 35-year-old actor, who is gay, last week. TMZ first reported the news.

The FBI is investigating that alleged letter, Guglielmi tells PEOPLE.

In photos of the purported letter — which were obtained by GrapeJuice.net and TMZ — the words “you will die black f–” are spelled out in magazine letter cut-outs.

A rep for Fox also confirmed that Empire’s shooting schedule will be reshuffled to accommodate his recovery. However, production was temporarily shut down on both of the network’s Chicago-based shows — Empire and Proven Innocent — due to severe weather. (The Illinois city is facing freezing temperatures and a polar vortex.)

Smollett’s rep has not responded to PEOPLE’s requests for comment.

PEOPLE has reached out to the FBI for comment. The agency declined to comment to the Sun-Times.

Smollett was treated at Northwestern Hospital and is in “good condition.”"

Smollett is best known for playing Jamal Lyon on Empire, a role that has earned him a lot of praise and made him a lot of friends. Those friends were horrified this week when Smollett was attacked outside of a restaurant in the early hours of the morning, beaten, doused with chemicals and choked with a noose. The attackers reportedly yelled racist and homophobic slurs at Smollett, leading police to investigate it as a hate crime. Smollett's attack took over social media for a while. Many prominent celebrities spoke out, including man who had never worked with Smollett professionally. People all across the entertainment industry were singing his praises, decrying the attack as another example of unchecked bigotry running amok. The man at the center of the incident has yet to speak out about his experience. To those who know him best, Smollett's work as an actor, musician and activist speaks for itself. Here is what you need to know about Smollett as he recovers in a Chicago hospital.

Slide 1 of 8 Background (Photo: Jerod Harris/Getty Images for The Trevor Project) Smollett is 36 years old, born in 1982 in Santa Rosa, California. He is the son of an African-American mother and a Jewish Russian and Polish immigrant father. Smollett has five siblings, several of whom also work in the entertainment industry. His brother Jake and his sister Jurnee are both also actors.

Slide 2 of 8 Acting Career (Photo: Fox) Smollett began acting in 1992 with a role in The Might Ducks as Terry Hall. He also appeared in Rob Reiner's 1994 film North, and that same year he and his siblings got an ABC sitcom called On Our Own. Smollett's career really took off as an adult. He appeared in the LGBT-themed rom-com The Skinny in 2012, and guest starred on The Mindy Project that same year. He picked up a few other important roles here and there before he was cast in Empire in 2015. Since then, Smollett has also appeared in Alien: Covenant, Marshall and other big hits.

Slide 3 of 8 Music Much like acting, Smollett got into music at a young age. he released an EP titled The Poisoned Hearts Club in 1994 while working on On Our Own. However, he refers to last year's record, Sum Of My Music, as his debut album. Smollett's work has a distinctly political bent to it, addressing social and societal issues and calling listeners to action.

Slide 4 of 8 Coming Out Smollett seemed to come out as a gay man publicly in 2015, during an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. He stressed that he was never truly ""in the closet,"" or trying to hide his orientation. However, he did hope that his performances would speak louder than personal life, and that he could normalize his sexuality rather than dramatically coming out. ""It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet,"" he said. ""There’s never been a closet. That I’ve been in. I don’t own a closet, I got a dresser, but I don’t have a closet, but I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home."" DeGeneres prodded gently for a more definitive answer, telling Smollett that she wanted to ""give him the opportunity"" to say what he needed to about himself. ""When I say that I don’t talk about my personal life, I’m saying that. But it is in no way to hide or deny who God made me. Ya know?"" he said. The following year, he gave another interview with Out Magazine, taking a more direct approach to labels. ""If I had to label myself, I would label myself as a gay man,"" he said. ""With that said, I believe that love is the only thing that matters, and I would hope that anybody would leave themselves open — not to gender, but to love.""

Smollett is dedicated to social justice and other activist causes. His Twitter bio says that he is ""simply here to help save the world,"" and he is outspoken against the Trump administration. Just last week, he was featured on MSNBC alongside his sister, Reverend Al Sharpton and Bennett College President Phyllis Dawkins.

Slide 6 of 8 Attack Smollett was attacked outside a fast food restaurant in Chicago in the early hours of Tuesday, Jan. 29. Police told CBS News that they were investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, as the attackers had shouted racist and homophobic slurs as they beat Smollett. They also dumped a chemical believed to be bleach on the actor, and tied a noose around his neck. Smollett said that the attackers shouted ""this is MAGA country"" at him as wel, referencing President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

Slide 7 of 8 Status (Photo: Instagram / Lee Daniels) Smollett transported himself to the hospital, where he was treated for cuts and bruises. Empire co-creator Lee Daniels posted a screenshot of a video chat with Smollett, showing abrasions on his face, though the picture was later deleted. Smollett was released from the hospital on Tuesday. As for the investigation itself, the FBI have officially gotten involved. Along with the police, they are reportedly canvassing nearby areas looking for any relevant security footage, though so far nothing has turned up. The studio where Empire is filmed was given extra security, especially for cast members following the attack."

The deadly arctic deep freeze wreaking havoc across the United States has left at least seven people dead with record-breaking low temperatures halting postal services in the Midwest and cancelling more than 2,500 flights.

Two people died in Detroit, Michigan after temperatures started plummeting late Tuesday as forecasters issued grave warnings that one of the coldest spells in history would be life-threatening.

Police found a man's body across the street from his home in the Detroit area on Wednesday. He was not wearing a hat or gloves and wasn't dressed for below-zero temperatures. A 70-year-old man was also found dead in Detroit in front of a neighbor's home on Wednesday.

The polar vortex in the Midwest came on the heels of major Winter Storm Jayden that dumped up to a foot of snow on the region over the weekend and was to blame for at least five deaths.

A 55-year-old man froze to death in his Milwaukee garage after he collapsed shoveling snow, a man was fatally struck by a snow plow in Chicago, a nine-year-old died in an Iowa pile up and a young couple were killed when their SUV struck another on a snowy road in northern Indiana.

Officials have warned that the freezing temperatures will only become more life-threatening overnight on Wednesday. Forecasters advised against breathing deeply or talking while outside and warned that frostbite and hypothermia issues could occur within seconds.

And on Wednesday plummeting temperatures even caused Hell - a small town near Michigan - to freeze over, which prompted much commentary on social media.

The unincorporated community, which is unsurprisingly subject of meteorological and winter jokes, had temperatures below zero on Wednesday afternoon with wind chills temperatures that were even colder.

The highest temperature reached -4F, prompting some on social media to note that Hell had literally frozen over.

While the extreme weather event caused hell to freeze over, temperatures were still warmer there compared to the Windy City due to Lake Michigan, meteorologists reported.

Temperatures plunged to as low as minus 42F in Park Rapids, Minnesota, minus 31F in Fargo, North Dakota and minus 27F in Minneapolis. In Chicago, temperatures were still dropping after plunging early Wednesday to minus 19F, breaking the day's previous record low set in 1966. Temperatures are expected drop as low as negative 28 degrees in Chicago as the day progresses. Wind chills in northern Illinois made it feel as cold as negative 57F.

In comparison, temperatures in parts of the Midwest were lower Wednesday than in Antarctica, where the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station hit negative 25F.

The extreme weather conditions triggered widespread closures of hundreds of schools and businesses from North Dakota to Pennsylvania.

Amtrak also axed all trains into and out of Chicago on Wednesday and most services to or from Chicago on Thursday. Crews had to set rail tracks in fire to keeps trains moving smoothly on Tuesday.

The U.S. Postal Service also took the rare step of suspending mail delivery to parts of Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, the Dakotas and Nebraska on Wednesday because of the dangerous Arctic blast.

Sub-zero temperatures already blanketing parts of Canada began sweeping across the Midwest and towards the East Coast on Tuesday evening. The frigid winds were bound for the East Coast later on Wednesday into Thursday.

The National Weather Service forecast for Wednesday night predicted temperatures in Chicago as low as minus 28, with wind chills to minus 50. Detroit's outlook was for Wednesday overnight lows around minus 15, with wind chills dropping to minus 40.

Governors in Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan have all declared emergencies as the worst of the cold threatened on Wednesday.

'We need everyone to do your part and make sure you and your families are prepared,' said Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.

The bitter cold is the result of a split in the polar vortex that allowed temperatures to plunge much further south in North America than normal.

'These are actually a public health risk and you need to treat it appropriately,' Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Tuesday. 'They are life-threatening conditions and temperatures.'

Officials in large Midwestern cities including Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago and Detroit were desperately trying to get the homeless off the streets.

Minneapolis charitable groups that operate warming places and shelters expanded hours and capacity, and ambulance crews handled all outside calls as being potentially life-threatening, according to Hennepin County Emergency Management Director Eric Waage.

MetroTransit said it wouldn't remove people from buses if they were riding them simply to stay warm, and weren't being disruptive.

Emanuel said Chicago was turning five buses into makeshift warming centers moving around the city, some with nurses aboard, to encourage the homeless to come in from the cold. About 160 warming centers were opened in the city.

'We're bringing the warming shelters to them, so they can stay near all of their stuff and still warm up,' said Cristina Villarreal, spokeswoman for the city's Department of Family and Support Services.

Shelters, churches and city departments in Detroit worked together to help get vulnerable people out of the cold, offering the message to those who refused help that 'you're going to freeze or lose a limb,' said Terra DeFoe, a senior adviser to Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.

Nineteen-year-old Deontai Jordan and dozens of others found refuge from the cold in the basement of a church in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

'You come here, you can take a nap, you can snack, you can use the bathroom, you might even be able to shower,' he said. 'And then they're feeding you well. Not to mention they give out clothes, they give out shoes, they give out socks.'

Hundreds of public schools and several large universities from North Dakota to Pennsylvania canceled classes on Tuesday and Wednesday. Closing schools for an extended stretch isn't an easy decision, even though most school districts build potential makeup days into their schedules, said Josh Collins, spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Education.

'Many students, they might have two working parents, so staying home might mean they're not supervised,' he said. 'For some low-income students, the lunch they receive at school might be their most nutritious meal of the day.'

American Indian tribes in the Upper Midwest were doing what they could to help members in need with heating supplies. Many people on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in the Dakotas live in housing that's decades old and in disrepair, or in emergency government housing left over from southern disasters such as hurricanes.

'They aren't made for this (northern) country. The cold just goes right through them,' said Elliott Ward, the tribe's emergency response manager.

The extreme cold was 'a scary situation' for the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, said Chris Fairbanks, manager of the northern Minnesota tribe's energy assistance program.

'We have many, many calls coming in. We're just swamped trying to get everybody what they need,' she said.

The cold was even shutting down typical outdoor activities. A ski hill in the Minneapolis area said it would close through Wednesday. So did an ice castle attraction.

The cold weather was even affecting beer deliveries, with a pair of western Wisconsin distributors saying they would delay or suspend shipments for fear that beer would freeze in their trucks.

The unusually frigid weather is attributed to a sudden warming far above the North Pole. A blast of warm air from misplaced Moroccan heat last month made the normally super chilly air temperatures above the North Pole rapidly increase.

That split the polar vortex into pieces, which then started to wander, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research.

One of those polar vortex pieces is responsible for the subzero temperatures across the Midwest this week.

Minnesota's Xcel Energy reported that equipment failures on power poles has led to outages throughout the Twin Cities. The outages started around 5.40pm and more than 3,000 people were still without power at 11pm Tuesday evening, according to CBS Minnesota.

It's so cold in Minnesota they can't deliver beer without it FREEZING in trucks The deadly arctic deep freeze has prompted beer distributors to halt deliveries of beer in Minnesota. Distributors have stopped delivering in the Twin Cities, down south and out west until the weather improves. It comes after kegged beer froze while out for delivery on Tuesday, and temperatures fell as low as negative 26 degrees Fahrenheit, with a wind chill of 53 below zero, in Minneapolis. Beer can freeze at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on its alcohol content, and temperatures across the Midwest are currently much lower than that. Advertisement

The National Weather Service (NWS) Twin Cities reported that the area is experiencing the coldest temperatures since 1996.

'These are VERY DANGEROUS conditions and can lead to frostbite on exposed skin in as little as five minutes where wind chill values are below -50,' the NWS tweeted. 'Best thing you can do is limit your time outside.'

A wind chill of minus 25 can freeze skin within 15 minutes, according to the service.

The NWS have even warned that people should avoid taking deep breaths and talking outside to ensure lungs are protected from the severely cold air.

Temperatures in almost a dozen states stretching more than 1,200 miles from the Dakotas to Ohio were forecast to be the coldest in a generation, if not on record.

'One of the coldest arctic air mass intrusions in recent memory is surging south into the Upper Midwest before spreading across much of the eastern two-thirds of the country,' the NWS said.

'Expect frigid temperatures, bitterly cold and life-threatening wind chills, likely leading to widespread record lows and low maximum temperatures from the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.'

The NWS forecast temperatures between -10 to -40 degrees Fahrenheit by Wednesday across the Midwest, with wind chills making it seem as cold as -65 degrees Fahrenheit in one area of Minnesota.

Scientists say climate change is causing more extreme weather, and one theory for polar vortex chills is that arctic air currents usually trapped around the North Pole are weakened and dislodged by a warming climate.

WHAT IS THE POLAR VORTEX? The polar vortex is an atmospheric circulation pattern that sits high above the poles, in a layer of the atmosphere called the stratosphere. This structure can weaken as a result of abnormal warming in the poles, causing it to split off into smaller ‘sister vortices’ that may travel outside of their typical range. The split higher up in the atmosphere could eventually cause a similar phenomenon to ‘drip’ down to the troposphere – the layer of the atmosphere closest to the surface, where most of our weather takes place. A split in the polar vortex can give rise to both sudden and delayed effects, much of which involves declining temperatures and extreme winter weather in the Eastern US along with Northern and Western Europe.

President Donald Trump used the occasion to again voice skepticism about climate change, tweeting: 'What the hell is going on with Global Waming? (sic) Please come back fast, we need you!'

But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates NWS, tweeted: 'Winter storms don't prove that global warming isn't happening.'

The NOAA also linked to a 2015 explanatory article in their tweet.

In New York City, forecasters are expecting temperatures to drop to near 5 degrees on Thursday morning. The wind chill then will be between -10 and -20.

The MTA says they will more than likely activate warming devices throughout their system to keep switches warm on all Long Island Rail Road and Metro North Railroad lines.

LIRR stations will also keep waiting rooms open 24 hours a day Wednesday through Saturday, according to CBS.

In New Jersey, Gov Phil Murphy is warning residents to plan for icy roads and potential blackouts.

Forecasters in western New York are warning of blizzard-like conditions over the next few days with up to two feet of snow, plummeting temperatures and wind chills that can cause frostbite in minutes.

In advance of the Great Lakes-fed storm, authorities closed schools in Buffalo and surrounding districts for Wednesday and Thursday and the state announced a ban on tractor-trailers and buses from the New York State Thruway.

The ban between Rochester and the Pennsylvania border took effect at 8pm Tuesday.

Drifting bands of lake-effect snow are expected to drop one to two feet by the storm's end. The hard-to-predict bands can bury some areas, even as the sun shines a short distance away.

Smollet’s breakthrough came aboard the hip-hop drama “Empire,” playing Jamal Lyon, a talented R&B singer struggling to earn his father’s approval and find his place in his dad’s music empire. It became one of the biggest network shows to star a gay black character.

Smollett, one of the young stars of “The Mighty Ducks” film in 1992, appeared in Ridley Scott’s science fiction film “Alien: Covenant” in 2017. The third of six children, he also starred in with his siblings in the 1994 ABC sitcom “On Our Own,” along with sisters Jurnee and Jazz and brothers Jake, Jocqui and Jojo.

Other film roles include Rob Reiner’s “North,” playing Langston Hughes in “Marshall” and playing the son of Halle Berry and Danny Glover in “Queen.” He also guest-starred on “The Mindy Project.”

Smollett came out as gay in 2015 in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, saying, “There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in.” In response to the alleged attack, the talk show host wrote on Twitter: “I’m sending him and his family so much love today.”

His work on “Empire” turbo-boosted his career, earning Emmy and Grammy nominations. His 10-track debut album, “Sum of My Music,” was released independently on his own label, Music of Sound, despite interest from major labels. He won the trophy for best supporting actor in a drama series at the 2017 NAACP Images Awards.

Smollett joined The Human Rights Campaign’s Equality Rocks campaign, joined other “Empire” cast members in an ad endorsing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and his music videos have explored social issues.

One video for the song “F.U.W.” highlights injustices, from human and LGBT rights to religious and racial prejudices. A woman wears a hijab in one scene, a boy wears a hoodie in another and four women put their fists up as they stand in front of the words, “My body, my rights.” In one scene, a wheelchair runs over a Donald Trump mask, an apparent reference to Trump’s alleged mocking of a disabled reporter.

“This song is for the oppressed. That’s why I feel like people will connect with it because it is very broad, because oppression is so broad,” he told The Associated Press in 2017. In his Twitter bio, Smollett wrote: “I am simply here to help save the world. Nothing is more important than love.”

Celebrities from Oscar-winner Viola Davis to supermodel Naomi Campbell were among those sharing support for Smollett. Lee Daniels, Steve Harvey, Janelle Monae, Jada Pinkett Smith and Kevin Hart all took to social media to send their best wishes. The cast of the Broadway show “Choir Boy” dedicated its Tuesday performance to Smollett.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Surveillance video captured potential persons of interest in the attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett in the Streeterville neighborhood, Chicago police said Wednesday afternoon.Chicago police released the photos late Wednesday. The photos show two silhouettes on New Street near Illinois between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. Tuesday.At about 2 a.m. Tuesday, Smollett, 36, reported he was walking alone in the 300-block of East North Water Street when two people he didn't know started yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, police said. He told Chicago police that the attackers yelled ""MAGA country,"" according to CPD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi.Police are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. A dozen detectives are working on the case and had reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance video before finding the images of the potential persons of interest. Chicago police said they would like to bring the two people in for questioning.""Obviously the alleged statement of what happened here is horrific and there's no place for it in the city of Chicago,"" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said during a Wednesday evening press briefing about the city's response to historic cold.Brandon Z.

9:21 PM PT -- According to local reporter Rob Elgas, Smollett was seen on surveillance camera walking on the opposite side of the street from the two persons of interest. Elgas claims both Smollett and the unidentified people then walk off camera (on different cameras). Smollett is unaccounted for on camera for about 60 seconds. He then reappears on surveillance entering a condo building with what appears to be street salt on his sweater and the rope around his neck. Jussie arrives at a friend's place where police arrive to take a report.

We've confirmed with law enforcement sources that Smollett refused to turn his cell phone over to authorities after telling them he was on the phone with his manager during the incident.

5:43 PM PT -- Chicago PD just released this screengrab from the surveillance video but, as you can see, it's virtually impossible to make out a single feature of the ""persons of interest.""

Cops say the two people in the image were walking on New Street near the intersection with E. Illinois Street between 1:30 AM and 1:45 AM. They're about a block from the Subway restaurant Jussie had gone to Tuesday morning ... and roughly halfway between the restaurant and Jussie's home.

Our law enforcement sources tell us detectives have scoured camera footage in the area and, to this point, haven't seen any sign of the alleged attack or Jussie's assailants.

Cops say they want to speak to the persons of interest to determine if they witnessed or were involved in the incident. As you can see from this image ... they've got their work cut out for them.

Cops investigating the Jussie Smollett attack say they finally have a lead from surveillance video ... but they're gonna need the public's help to locate multiple persons of interest.

Chicago PD says detectives were able to find a camera angle that revealed ""persons of interest wanted for questioning"" in the assault and battery of the ""Empire"" star. Cops are careful not to call the people suspects in the case.

Police say they'll be releasing images of the persons of interest shortly.

We broke the story ... Jussie says two men in ski masks jumped him, beat him up, doused him with bleach and left a rope around his neck before fleeing. He says they yelled, ""MAGA country"" as they got away.

We've confirmed Jussie's manager Brandon Z. Moore told police he was on the phone with Jussie during the alleged attack. Brandon says he told cops he clearly heard the MAGA comment as well as the racial and homophobic slurs.

We know the attack happened somewhere near Jussie's residence in Chicago, and that police were reviewing cameras -- city-owned and from privately owned buildings in the area."

Five minutes to frostbite

At least seven deaths have been linked to the historic polar vortex this week as temps plunged below zero and wind chill turned deadly. Among them:

In Chicago, a man was killed by a snow plow.

In Milwaukee, a man was found frozen to death in a garage.

An Iowa college student was found unresponsive outside a campus hall.

A young Indiana couple died in a car crash.

Chicago tumbled to 21 degrees below zero. Wind chill dropped to 51 below – letting frostbite set in within five minutes. The United States Postal Service halted deliveries in 10 states. Thousands of flights were delayed or canceled, and ""there is not enough space for all the homeless suffering out there now,"" a Michigan shelter director warned.

A woman left two dogs, Chloe and Sophie, chained outside without food or water as the Iowa cold ramped up last week. Rebecca Woods, 22, was charged with two counts of animal neglect.

And one tip: How often should you start your car to keep it from freezing? Don't.

Put down the chicken nugget

It's clucking serious: Tyson Foods recalled around 36,000 pounds of chicken nuggets that might be contaminated with rubber. It's a “Class I” recall, meaning use of the product could cause ""serious, adverse health consequences or death."" The nugs in question are panko chicken ones produced on Nov. 26, 2018, with a ""best if used by"" date of Nov. 26, 2019. The recall comes a day after Perdue Foods recalled 16,000 pounds of chicken nuggets.

And don't wash those nuggets down with fruit juice. It may contain harmful levels of arsenic, lead and other metals, a study found.

Actor says his attackers yelled 'This is MAGA country'

Chicago police are hunting for assailants who ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett says attacked him Tuesday morning in a “possible hate crime.” Sgt. Cindy Guerra told USA TODAY that Smollett said his attackers yelled ""This is MAGA country."" Smollett, 36, was approached by two people who punched him in the face, poured a chemical on him and wrapped a rope around his neck, he says.

This Brady prank got deflated

Pittsburgh TV producer Michael Telek tacked on a joke at the end of a news broadcast Monday, a ""wink and nod to Steelers fans"" who've long despised New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. In a Super Bowl story on KDKA-TV, he typed ""Known Cheater"" under Brady's name in a graphic – a nod to the ""Deflategate"" scandal that left the quarterback briefly suspended in 2016. Telek's bosses didn't laugh. Less than 24 hours later, he was out of a job.

Way more veterans could get free private health care

Nearly four times as many veterans could be eligible for private health care paid for by Veterans Affairs. Under new rules proposed Wednesday, veterans would get private care if they have to wait more than 20 days or drive more than 30 minutes for a VA appointment. Critics say the proposal will drain money from the VA and lead to its privatization. The rules would deliver on a key campaign promise of President Donald Trump.

The most recent FBI hate crimes report found a 17 percent year-over-year spike in bias crimes in 2017 — the third consecutive yearly increase. Nearly 58 percent of the reported bias incidents were motivated by the victims’ race, ethnicity or ancestry, and more than 17 percent were motivated by sexual orientation or gender identity.

While the FBI’s report does not specify how many of the victims were LGBTQ people of color, the Anti-Violence Project, a national nonprofit that tracks violence against the LGBTQ community, told NBC News it, too, has seen an increase in hate violence and noted that LGBTQ people of color often bear the brunt of these bias incidents.

“LGBTQ people living at multiple intersections of oppression, such as racism and homophobia, experience compounded violence,” Eliel Cruz, a spokesperson for AVP, explained.

Cruz said Smollett’s alleged attack is “reflective of what we see in our national data of hate violence.” In 2017, AVP recorded a record-high 52 anti-LGBTQ homicides across the U.S. More than 70 percent of those victims, according to the report, were people of color.

Transgender women of color are particularly at risk, according to AVP, which found 22 of the 52 homicide victims (42 percent) in 2017 were trans women of color.

For members of QLatinx, a Florida-based LGBTQ Latino advocacy and support group, the reported rise in violence against LGBTQ people of color is far from abstract.

Christopher Cuevas, executive director of QLatinx, said the organization was founded in response to the 2016 mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub, which left 49 people dead, most of them LGBTQ Latinos. Cuevas said QLatinx was originally started to provide a space for LGBTQ Latinos in Central Florida to process their trauma from the shooting.

The organization’s work has since expanded, but among its highest priorities is to “work towards a society free of fear, violence, and hate,” according to its mission statement.

“LGBTQ communities of color are at the greatest risk of violence” Cuevas said, citing the AVP report. “We see this growing trend in violence against our community and not enough infrastructural support to ensure we are protected, so we need to protect ourselves.”

QLatinx isn’t alone in its work. Throughout the country, groups like the Trans Women of Color Collective and the Boston Hispanic Black Gay Coalition work specifically to empower and advocate for LGBTQ people of color.

Taraji P. Henson showed support for her Empire costar Jussie Smollett one day after he was attacked in an apparent hate crime in Chicago.

“I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now,” Henson, 48, wrote on Instagram on Wednesday, January 30. “@jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.”

Alongside a video of Smollett, 36, singing, the actress added, “This song needs to be downloaded until it goes triple platinum because the message is NEEDED. #weareresilientpeople AND #weaintgoingnowhereuntillwearefinished. The love so many have him just goes to show HE IS LOVE!!!! I LOVE YOU MY BABY MY BABY!!! #LOVEWINSALWAYS.”

The actor-singer — who plays Jamal Lyon, the son of Henson’s character, Loretha “Cookie” Lyon, on the Fox musical drama — transported himself to the hospital in the early hours of Tuesday, January 29, after two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs toward him, attacked him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck. The Chicago Police Department confirmed to Us Weekly that detectives are investigating the incident as a “possible hate crime.” Smollett, who came out as gay in 2015, has since been released from the hospital and is listed in “good condition.”

Countless celebrities took to social media after the news broke to send their love to Smollett. Empire cast member Terrence Howard, who plays Cookie’s husband and Jamal’s father, Lucious Lyon, also spoke out during an appearance on Good Morning America on Wednesday, saying, “Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t — and we cannot — forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”"

Howard, 49, appeared on Good Morning America on Wednesday, January 30, and opened up about the moment the Empire cast learned that Smollett, 36, was hospitalized. “Jaws dropped to the ground,” the Law & Order: LA alum recalled. “And then when we learned there had been letters that had been sent to Fox as threats about the potential of something like this … then we became much more frightened.”

As for how the star is doing following the assault, Howard explained that Smollett is “getting better,” but it’s going to take time for physical and emotional wounds to heal.

“You know, he’s angry, but I know Jussie,” the Hada Madrina actor said. “Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t — and we cannot — forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

The Chicago Police Department confirmed to Us Weekly that Smollett was attacked early Tuesday in Chicago by two people who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him.” Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi added: “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

Smollett, who came out as gay on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2015, was able to transport himself to a local hospital after the suspects fled the scene. He was released the same day and is said to be in “good condition.” The actor has not yet spoken publicly about the attack, which detectives are treating “as a possible hate crime,” but he has received numerous messages of support from celebrities such as Ariana Grande, John Legend and Katy Perry.

“What happened to jussie makes me really f—king sick to my stomach,” Grande, 25, tweeted on Tuesday. “I can’t believe s—t like this is really still happening everyday. what kind of world ? sending all of the healing energy / love i possibly can and hoping for change. what can we do ? tell me & i’m there.”

Legend, 40, wrote on Twitter: “Sending love to Jussie and the Smollett family after this horrific attack. We support you and pray that you find peace and justice.”

“Standing with and sending love to @JussieSmollett today,” Perry, 34, added. “This is a racist hate crime and is disgusting and shameful to our country #WeLoveJussie.”"

Rob Elgas, a reporter for Chicago’s ABC affiliate, took to Twitter this afternoon to note that the Chicago police are reviewing area video surveillance and have so far found no one who could be an obvious suspect in the attack.

“As Chicago police expand their search for the men who allegedly attacked Jussie Smollett,” Elgas tweeted, adding, “a spokesman says this morning there have been ‘no obvious people that could be assailants’ discovered. Detectives have poured over hundreds of hours of surveillance video.”

Police have even expanded the search for a mile around the area Smollett claimed he was attacked.

According to CNN’s Sara Sidner:

“In a place so far with a high number of private surveillance cameras, they cannot find any images of the two alleged attackers. After combing through hundreds of hours of videos, the only image of Smollett police obtained from security cameras was inside the Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime — and he was standing alone.”

Thus far, the CPD have reviewed “hundreds of hours footage” and found no video evidence to substantiate the claims Jussie Smollett made about being attacked on February 29 at 2 AM on the below freezing, snow-covered streets of Chicago.

Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said, noting that the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said, noting that the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said, noting that the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

The actor, apparently by himself at the time, was attacked by two assailants. During the attack Smollett was reportedly hit repeatedly, had a noose thrown around his neck, doused in some unknown chemical substance, and was subjected to the slurs “f*ggot” and “n*gger”. The attack was a modern day lynching.

The Black queer communities around the world are shaken, but not shocked. In fact, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs attacks on LGBTQ folks are still very prevalent, with many attacks being targeted towards queer and trans people of color, especially Black trans women. While overall statistics on attacks are down (this may be due to decreased reports and data collection from agencies rather than an actual downturn in violence), it seems that more severe attacks and homicides are on the rise.

What does this tell us about allyship?

The queer community is hurting. More specifically, the Black queer community is hurting. The attack on Smollett is a reminder of one’s difference, isolation, and vulnerability that so many Black queer folks carry on a day to day basis. And for some, Smollett’s attack is a trigger of the violence that many LGBTQ folks have experienced at the hands of not only strangers but also partners and family members. It’s devastating.

As the news rolled across social media about the attack on Jussie, I could almost hear that collective cry of Black queer folks online. The community was reeling, trying to cope with the idea that a member of the community, someone so privileged as Smollett, was not safe from such an attack. It’s a reminder that in a lot of ways, for Black LGBTQ folks safety is an illusion.

There have been noticeably fewer tweets and comments from allies than those in the Black queer community themselves. My hope is that as word spreads more allies will express their feelings and condolences not only for Jussie but for the community at large.

Make no mistake, if you are a white person, or a cisgender heterosexual person, if you do not speak up or check on your Black queer loved ones in the coming days you will be sending the message that you’re not a safe person to trust either.

Allyship not only means showing up when asked to, but it also means making it a point to educate yourself about issues affecting the communities that you don’t belong to. It means checking in with your loved ones when a Black queer person is almost killed just for existing. If that seems out of reach for you, then you shouldn’t consider yourself worthy of the ally badge.

When a comic suggests that he’d beat his son if he were gay, show up and SPEAK OUT. When a politician dehumanizes a people to advance his racist policies, SPEAK OUT. It’s incumbent on all of us to do the work to support the ability for our brothers and sisters to thrive in this world. Without action (whatever is accessible for you) we are complicit in our collective downfall.

I believe that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said it best:

He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.

The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said, noting that the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said.

Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said, noting that the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

As earlier reported by Legit.ng, Bobrisky took to showing empathy to Jussie Smollett, an American gay actor known for his role in Empire, who claimed that he had been assaulted and harassed by two men. These men had thrown insults at him for being black and gay.

While efforts are being made to identify the men who had accosted the handsome actor, several people have taken to weighing in on the issue. In this regard, Stella Damasus also gave her opinion on the issue

She condemned the unnecessary attack on the actor and asserted that no one had any reason to harass him. The actress also expressed her wish that the attackers be found and punished for their offence.

""I strongly believe that ignorance is worse than illiteracy. When one is considered an illiterate in certain things, then there is hope of learning and acquiring knowledge. On the other hand when one is ignorant, they think they already know but painfully, what they think they know is so wrong and off the point. This is a sad situation because their minds are closed to learning anything. Sometimes it’s easier to get pissed off at these people but I think what I feel now is pity. Anyone who thinks it’s okay for someone to be attacked because of their race, religion or sexual preference should pls click the unfollow button. Make it easier for us so that I don’t have to waste my time blocking you.

""Anyone who uses the BIBLE to preach HATE should not even be on my follow list. Please where in the Bible did God say you should beat up or attack anyone who has a different preference? When did we become judge? Is it just me or are we, as Christians not asked to love one another? When the devil takes over your life, he doesn’t make you worship him, he makes you negate the word of God. So all those ignorant ones coming to my page to spew their rubbish pls leave this page.

Were you high when I went on international television to go up against a senator talking about our little girls? Were you unable to get data to see how some of us have worked to help in areas of education?

""Like i said, kindly unfollow. I would rather have 10 reasonable followers who are sensible and forward thinking than have hundreds of thousands who are ignorant, stagnant and lazy in the brain. I have had to block and delete some hateful comments and speeches on my page. So now I am pleading for people who show their ignorant hatred for others to save me the stress and just unfollow.""

Stella Damasus has shown that she has no free time to play around with trolls. Recently, Tonto Dikeh also took to addressing trolls who attacked her when she sympathised with and asked that the hate crime done against Jussie Smollett be avenged.

Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said, noting that the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said, noting that the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said, noting that the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said, noting that the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Jussie Smollett claimed he was attacked by men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him and physically assaulted him.

Smollett, who is openly gay, was hospitalised after the attack, which took place around 2 am as he was walking downtown. The actor and singer was reportedly in Chicago for a concert scheduled for February 2.

According to the police, the two attackers poured “an unknown chemical substance” on Smollett and then wrapped a rope around his neck. Smollet told police that the attackers shouted “MAGA country” during the attack. “Maga” stands for “Make America Great Again”, Donald Trump’s election campaign slogan in 2016.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” said the Chicago Police Department.

The Chicago Police later told ABC News that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is assisting in the probe.

Although the police did not name the victim and only said he was an actor from Empire, Smollett’s fellow cast members and production company identified him as the victim.

The police are yet to make any arrests in the case, the Chicago Tribune reported. The police on Tuesday collected footage from city and private cameras in the Streeterville neighbourhood where the attack took place, but were yet to identify any suspects. “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline,” said Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi.

The Fox network, which produces and airs Empire, said it was “deeply saddened and outraged” with the attack. “We will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,” said the network. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Senator Kamala Harris, who announced on January 21 that she would run for president in 2020, called the incident “an attempted modern day lynching”. “No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin,” Harris tweeted. “We must confront this hate.”"

The data presented by Andrew Rhodes, Mexico’s national commissioner for protected natural areas, was cheered but scientists quickly warned that it does not mean the butterflies that migrate from Canada and the United States are out of danger.

This winter, researchers found the butterflies occupying 14.95 acres of pine and fir forests in the mountains of Michoacan and Mexico states. That’s an increase from 6.12 acres a year ago.

They arrive in such numbers that their population is measured by how much surface area they cover.

This year’s is the biggest measurement since the 2006-07 period, Rhodes said. A low of just 1.66 acres was recorded in 2013-14.

But loss of habitat, pesticide and herbicide use and climate change will continue to threaten the species.

The cast and crew shoot the series in Chicago, but the Windy City's temperatures are well below freezing pacing -22 degrees, with a wind chill in the -40's.

According to Entertainment Weekly, those temperatures run parallel with parts of Siberia, the Arctic, even colder than recent temperatures on Mars. Sadly, seven people have been reported dead in the Midwest.

Sources have said that their pause is not due to the racist and homophobic attack on cast member, Jussie Smollett. The attack happened early Tuesday morning when Smollett was leaving a Subway restaurant at around 2 a.m. Armed men in ski masks tied a rope around his neck and poured bleach on his face while yelling racist and homophobic slurs before running away. Smollett had to transport himself to the hospital where he was treated for minor injuries and later discharged.

The attack happened eight days after Fox Studios received an anonymous letter threatening the actor's life. The letter featured words spelled with letters cut out from magazines that read, ""You will die black f—.""

As a response, Empire hired armed security for the actor in the wake of this devastating news.

Some of his cast members have broken their silence regarding the attack.

Taraji P. Henson — who acts as his mother on the series — captioned a black-and-white video of Smollett performing his song ""F.U.W"", ""I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn't and we all feel his pain right now. [Jussie Smollett] is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very buys right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.""

""This song needs to be downloaded until it goes triple platinum because the message is NEEDED,"" she continued. ""#weareresilientpeople AND #weaintgoingnowhereuntilwearefinished. The love so many have him just goes to show HE IS LOVE!!!! I LOVE YOU MY BABY MY BABY!!! #LOVEWINSALWAYS.""

Terrance Howard — who plays his father on the show — spoke his thoughts on the matter as well.

""I heard he's getting better. You know, he's angry. But I know Jussie. Jussie's anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won't, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance,"" he said.

Other celebrities like Kevin Hart and Ariana Grande have sent their love his way as well."

Khouri, the Oscar-winning writer of “Thelma & Louise” and the creator of the series “Nashville,” made her remarks at the Paramount Theatre in Hollywood during her induction into the Final Draft Hall of Fame. She emphasized the role that writers play in troubled times.

“I decided to talk about our responsibility as storytellers,” she said. “We have to help each other understand how connected we are. We are seeing things in 2019 that would not look out of place in 1939 and that’s a failure of our society, so we have to keep telling our stories.”

Khouri admitted that it’s still a challenge to make herself write. “I would be most qualified to write about how to avoid writing because that’s what I’m best at,” she added.

She also revealed that she wrote “Thelma & Louise” by hand. “There was no Final Draft. And that’s how long I’ve been writing.”

Warner Bros. Production president Courtenay Valenti presented the award to Khouri, noting the profound impact that “Thelma & Louise” had when it was released in 1992. “It was a story that told the truth about women’s lives,” she said.

Khouri also penned the scripts for “Something to Talk About” and “Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,” which marked her directorial debut. She also helmed the 2008 Diane Keaton/Queen Latifah crime comedy “Mad Money.”

The 14th annual Final Draft event, emceed by Randy and Jason Sklar (the Sklar Brothers), also saw “Sorry to Bother You” director-writer Boots Riley and “Vida” creator and showrunner Tanya Saracho presented with its New Voice awards.

Riley was presented his award by “Sorry to Bother You” cast members Armie Hammer and Terry Crews, who began by making fun of himself and Riley.

“There’s probably nothing more cringe-worthy in Hollywood than a rapper with a script, except a former NFL player who wants to act,” Crews said. “His script hit me so deeply that it opened a porthole in my brain and the truth poured in.”

“We’re in a time where there are movements growing all around the world and screenwriting for film has always been way behind the curve,” Riley said. “A lot of us have progressive and radical politics that we edit out.”

Riley urged the audience to express ideas such as class struggle, which is portrayed in his movie. “People want to fight for something new,” he added. “All you writers and actors in here — you’re very powerful.”

Temma Hankin

Saracho received her award from “One Day at a Time” showrunner Gloria Calderon Kellett and expressed her frustration with the lack of Latina stories.

“Our narrative as Latinas is being discounted from the larger narrative of this country,” she noted. “We don’t count. I don’t know why.”

She also said the Final Draft award is a validation to someone who’s an immigrant, queer, and a person with “crushing self-doubt.”

Myles Reid won the Final Draft Big Break screenwriting contest award for TV for “Scattershot” and Jeff Cassidy took the Big Break feature award for “Daisy’s Story.”

Previous recipients of the Final Draft Hall of Fame honor include Aaron Sorkin, Nancy Meyers, Lawrence Kasdan, Paul Schrader, Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski, Steven Zaillian, Robert Towne, Oliver Stone, and Sydney Pollack."

“Empire” actor Terrence Howard shared supportive words for costar Jussie Smollett in the aftermath of a horrific attack.

Smollett was hospitalized Tuesday after two people ambushed him, put a rope around his neck and berated him with homophobic and racial slurs in Chicago.

“I heard he’s getting better,” Howard said during a “Good Morning America” interview Wednesday. “You know, he’s angry. But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

Police in Chicago are currently investigating the attack as a possible hate crime. No suspects have been identified, nor have any arrests been made.

The attackers also poured an unidentified substance on Smollett, police said.

Howard, who plays the father of Smollett’s character on “Empire,” said Wednesday that Smollett is the person who “cheers everyone up” on set.

“He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping,” Howard said on the ABC morning show. “Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family, the Fox family, the Empire family, the Lyon family, was attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.”

Smollett publicly came out as gay in 2015 and portrays a gay character on “Empire.”

Jussie Smollett’s Empire family is now speaking out about the actor’s recent attack.

Earlier this week, the actor was brutally beaten by men, who also hurled racist and homophobic slurs, in what Chicago police are calling a “possible hate crime.”

Taraji P. Henson, who plays his onscreen mother Cookie Lyon on the hit Fox TV show, recently took to Instagram to send love to her “baby.”

“I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now,” Henson wrote on the social network. “[Smollett] is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!!

Henson also had a message for people who agree with the bigots who attacked Smollett.

“I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him,” she said. “The devil and his minions are very busy right now, but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know. This song needs to be downloaded until it goes triple platinum because the message is NEEDED.”

Terrence Howard, who plays Smollett’s father on the show, also shared his thoughts about the horrific incident on Good Morning America.

“I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,” Howard said Wednesday.

“But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance,” he added.

The Chicago Police Department, aided by the FBI, has launched an investigation into Smollett’s assault. They’re asking for the public’s help in finding and identifying his attackers by calling the tip line, at 312-747-8382, or visiting cpdtip.com."

According to Chicago police, the Empire actor was approached by two masked men who got his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs. They then hit him repeatedly in the face, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and put a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene. Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital and is said to recuperating at his home. The incident is being investigated by the Chicago PD and FBI as a hate crime.

Smollett, who came out in 2015, has been at the forefront of LGBTQ advocacy since, fighting for marginalized communities whose lives, like his, are at the intersection of Black and queer. He’s been vocal about the plight of Black gay men within the Black and LGBTQ communities, grappling with homophobia, racism, and exclusionary biases that often preclude them from the narrative of disenfranchisement in this country.

Smollett’s engagement with intersectionality shines a light on the very present danger of being Black and outwardly gay in a world that’s too often accepting of neither identity.

“It’s important to acknowledge that the hate Smollett faced as a Black gay man was a byproduct of society’s tolerance of racism and homophobia,” Ernest Owens wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost. “There is racial bias in how LGBTQ people are protected in mainstream society, as there is homophobia in how Black people are protected within their own community.”

Hate-related homicide victims have overwhelmingly been transgender women and queer, bi, or gay cisgender men of color. In 2017 alone, 60 percent of hate-related deaths in the US were of Black victims, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs.

For many, the most triggering aspect of the attack on Smollett was the use of the noose. Nooses represent a death threat specific to Black people and have a history rooted in racism, homophobia, and misogyny that is tethered to the history and fabric of this country. Chattel enslavement thrived by means of the killing, torturing, and policing Black masculinity and sexuality in ways that still make many, including those in the Black queer community, feel unsafe.

Terrorism of queer communities is not just limited to lynchings: It includes bombings, death threats, and physical violence that, in our current time, still plague Black queer and non-queer people alike.

“Many straight and cisgender [both Black and white] people—who are just as violent towards Black queer folks—find solace in the fact that they use different weapons [besides nooses] and intentions than those who attacked Jussie,” Ashleigh Shackelford, an artist in residence at SNaP Co, an Atlanta-based Black Trans-led advocacy organization, told Broadly. “But death is death, and expecting anyone to kill or shrink parts of their existence is violent, no matter what weapon is used. No one is safe under antiblackness.”

Symbols of lynching like nooses have been representative of white domestic terror since the late 1800s. But the history of lynching is not history at all—it is a current-day fear that Black queer folks still contend with. Black Twitter responded to Smollett's attack quickly, sharing perspectives on the danger of being publicly queer and Black in America.

Racism and homophobia, for many, don't act non-exclusively, but instead, stem from the same place. “The same hate that drives white supremacy is the same hate that fuels homophobia. It attempts to force us back into the shadows,” Preston Mitchum, an international policy analyst at Advocates for Youth, told Broadly.

“It tells us that we aren’t enough. It sometimes makes institutional racism and heterosexism impenetrable forces onto our bodies, and harms us from receiving sustainable housing, employment, and schooling,” says Mitchum.

While the investigation behind who assaulted Smollett continues, the work to elevate the conversation about the dangers faced by Black queer people—and the required steps to protect them—are equally as vital. Shackelford believes this is already happening within queer circles, as a form of self-preservation.

“It is our duty as Black queer and trans folks to provide the protection and resources we’re intentionally denied,"" they said. ""We deserve a world of possibility without bloodshed. We deserve to exist.”"

McConnell was speaking about H.R. 1, legislation that Democrats have made a centerpiece of their agenda since retaking the House earlier this month.

Related Headlines Lawmaker proposing bill to make Election Day a holiday

In remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell, R-Ky., said Democrats “want taxpayers on the hook for generous new benefits for federal bureaucrats and government employees,” including making Election Day a “new paid holiday for government workers.”

“So this is the Democrats’ plan to ‘restore democracy,'” McConnell said, describing the legislation as “a political power grab that’s smelling more and more like what it is.”

The far-reaching legislation would also prohibit the purging of voter rolls, require presidential and vice-presidential candidates to release their tax returns, compel states to adopt independent redistricting commissions and create a matching system for small-dollar donations to congressional campaigns, among other changes.

In his Wednesday remarks, as well as in a Washington Post commentary earlier this month, McConnell mocked the legislation as the “Democrat Politician Protection Act.”

“H.R. 1 would victimize every American taxpayer by pouring their money into expensive new subsidies that don’t even pass the laugh test,” McConnell said on the Senate floor.

His remarks prompted a wave of criticism by Democrats, some of whom argued that McConnell was acknowledging that Republicans want to make it more difficult for Americans to vote.

“Voting is a power grab. By citizens,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said in a tweet Wednesday afternoon.

Ezra Levin, a former Capitol Hill staffer who co-founded the Indivisible network of liberal activist groups, accused McConnell of “rehearsing old lines.”

“In 1977, after Watergate and Nixon, Jimmy Carter was inaugurated and proposed expansive reforms to campaign finance and to make it easier to vote,” he said on Twitter. “The GOP called it a ‘power grab’ and killed it in the Senate.”

Walter Shaub, a former director of the Office of Government Ethics, noted that a significant number of federal workers are military veterans and suggested combining Election Day with Veterans Day, a proposal that has made the rounds in recent years.

“A ‘power grab’ to let people vote?” Shaub said in a tweet. “He also says it’s just a holiday for bureaucrats, almost 1/3 of whom are veterans. How about McConnell compromises by moving Veterans Day to the 1st Tuesday in November? What better way to honor veterans than by making it easier for them to vote?”

NEW YORK - TV star and musician Jussie Smollett, who alleges he was the victim of a brutal racial and homophobic attack , is a former child star who grew up to become a champion of LGBT rights and one of the few actors to play a black gay character on primetime TV.

Smollet's breakthrough came aboard the hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" playing Jamal Lyon, a talented R&B singer struggling to earn his father's approval and find his place in his dad's music empire. It became one of the biggest network shows to star a gay black character.

Smollett, one of the young stars of ""The Mighty Ducks"" film in 1992, appeared in Ridley Scott's science fiction film ""Alien: Covenant"" in 2017. The third of six children, he also starred in with his siblings in the 1994 ABC sitcom ""On Our Own,"" along with sisters Jurnee and Jazz and brothers Jake, Jocqui and Jojo.

Other film roles include Rob Reiner's ""North,"" playing Langston Hughes in ""Marshall"" and playing the son of Halle Berry and Danny Glover in ""Queen."" He also guest-starred on ""The Mindy Project.""

Smollett came out as gay in 2015 in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, saying, ""There's never been a closet that I've been in."" In response to the alleged attack, the talk show host wrote on Twitter: ""I'm sending him and his family so much love today.""

His work on ""Empire"" turbo-boosted his career, earning Emmy and Grammy nominations. His 10-track debut album, ""Sum of My Music,"" was released independently on his own label, Music of Sound, despite interest from major labels. He won the trophy for best supporting actor in a drama series at the 2017 NAACP Images Awards.

Smollett joined The Human Rights Campaign's Equality Rocks campaign, joined other ""Empire"" cast members in an ad endorsing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and his music videos have explored social issues.

One video for the song ""F.U.W."" highlights injustices, from human and LGBT rights to religious and racial prejudices. A woman wears a hijab in one scene, a boy wears a hoodie in another and four women put their fists up as they stand in front of the words, ""My body, my rights."" In one scene, a wheelchair runs over a Donald Trump mask, an apparent reference to Trump's alleged mocking of a disabled reporter.

""This song is for the oppressed. That's why I feel like people will connect with it because it is very broad, because oppression is so broad,"" he told The Associated Press in 2017. In his Twitter bio, Smollett wrote: ""I am simply here to help save the world. Nothing is more important than love.""

Celebrities from Oscar-winner Viola Davis to supermodel Naomi Campbell were among those sharing support for Smollett. Lee Daniels, Steve Harvey, Janelle Monae, Jada Pinkett Smith and Kevin Hart all took to social media to send their best wishes. The cast of the Broadway show ""Choir Boy"" dedicated its Tuesday performance to Smollett."

This isn’t a new play. Far right types like Coulter frequently attempt to act as if racism doesn’t exist now, or never even really existed at all, as if people of color are all lying about their experiences. Those experiences could be subtle or extremely obvious, and it wouldn't matter — racism deniers always deny.

It’s easy for Coulter to parade around in all her privileged-drenched denial because she’s white in America, which makes her exempt from racism-based suffering. Meanwhile, people are being attacked for the color of their skin, and for their sexuality — just like the attack Jussie Smollett describes suffering early Tuesday morning in Chicago.

Most know Smollett from the hit Fox show ""Empire,"" where he plays Jamal Lyons, one of the most talented singers in a family full of musicians. Smollett’s character is also gay, and often has to deal with the homophobia that exists in African American culture and the hyper-masculine hip hop industry. Fans love Jamal because his is a true hero's tale. He handles the bigotry like a champ, always shutting down haters, destroying destructive societal norms and giving voice to a marginalized group that doesn’t get as much screen time as it should. Smollett himself is also a gay musician. As he explained to Ellen DeGeneres back in 2015, ""There's never been a closet that I've been in.” The pride he rightly takes in his identity is inspiring and deserves celebration. But as oppressed people know, that is not always how the world reacts.

As Smollett reported to the Chicago police this week, he found himself the target of the same ignorant homophobia that his character bravely confronts on the show, along with racism — you know, the same type of bigotry that far-right folks say doesn’t really exist — when he was attacked in public.

According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett said he was leaving a restaurant around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he heard racial and homophobic slurs from two people who then punched him, poured a chemical substance on him, wrapped a noose around his neck, and yelled, “This is MAGA country!” before fleeing the scene. Smollett was able to take himself to the hospital, and a representative for the actor says he is ""recovering well."" Police are currently investigating.

News about the attack spread quickly online Tuesday afternoon and evening, with media outlets including Salon quoting the police's statement that they are investigating the incident as a “possible hate crime"" — because you can’t just say “hate crime,” even if the victim is black and gay, and reports assailants spitting racial and homophobic slurs at him as they physically attacked him and placed a noose around his neck. There are strict rules that we in the media must follow before using hate-crime language. However, observing those rules in the interest of legal objectivity also inadvertently creates space in the conversation for racism deniers to question what might seem obvious about the motivation behind such an attack, or otherwise make excuses for bigoted acts in general.

Many Americans feel more comfortable with the idea that hate crimes are rare, far and few between. Oppressed people know that is not true. Smollett likely knows that isn’t true, too, and he remains an outspoken advocate for Black lives and LBGQTAI rights.

What happened to Freddie Gray, Walter Scott, Travon Martin, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, and hundreds of other innocent African Americans who have died because of nothing but the color of their skin — we in the media aren’t allowed to say these are hate crimes, especially when the perpetrators have been exonerated by the legal system. What else should we call them?

The power of platform is currently paying dividends for the fight against racism and homophobia as celebrities from Ava DuVernay to Ariana Grande are sharing their support for Smollett and making known their disgust for hate crimes — and calling them what they are is the first step to making our country better for everyone.

I’m sure that every conservative who has embraced the ""Make America Great Again"" slogan isn’t a bigot. Many in their right minds wouldn’t want to be affiliated, even by association, with Smollett’s attackers in any way. Enlightening them to what is reportedly being done in the name of MAGA, though, may make them more aware of how stupidly destructive this strain of culture has become. Perhaps some will now consider abandoning a movement that has been tied to a rise in hate-based attacks on one hand, and denies the existence of even the systems of belief that perpetuate them on the other."

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search .

Smollett also has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

Earlier this week, Smollett was the victim of a reported physical homophobic and racist attack. Since his hospitalization, several fellow stars, including Hart, have spoken out against the crime. Hart’s message is being rejected by many social media users, though, given the comedian’s previous controversy involving homophobic jokes.

Hart initially shared a photo of Smollett on Instagram and penned a message about spreading love in the world.

“Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett….This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better,” the Night School actor wrote. “Why are we falling in love with hate?…Choose love…I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

On Wednesday afternoon, Hart continued his message by saying he does not condone hate and he is starting “operation love.”

“Hate makes me sick to my stomach…it’s pointless,” he wrote, adding that only “cowards” embrace hate.

Hart has since faced backlash for his posts. Just last month, the comedian stepped down from hosting the Oscars when a series of homophobic tweets and stand-up jokes that he penned years ago resurfaced. He later apologized for his actions. Now, followers are citing Smollett’s attack as a reason why Hart’s homophobic jokes were often controversial, according to People.

OMG!! THIS is why the LGBTQ community continue to fight to be seen and PROTECTED against hate!



We ALL have to take this racist and homophobic act of violence very personally! My arms are around you @jussiesmollett. You are loved! https://t.co/bprDZ3Luah — Viola Davis (@violadavis) January 29, 2019

“This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny,” TV writer Ira Madison III wrote on Twitter.

Many users responded to Hart’s prayers for Smollett with critical GIFs, while one told the comedian to “keep your tears and prayers.”

Another person referenced Kevin Hart’s interview with Ellen DeGeneres where the talk show host admitted that she stood by the comedian amid the Oscars controversy. They wrote that the attackers will likely “score” an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and possibly engage in a roundtable discussion on the matter with Hart, Us Weekly reported.

There were also several users that jumped to Hart’s defense, pointing out that he did apologize for the controversy.

“Why not forgive? Is it now that Kevin isn’t entitled to feel pain for the suffering of another black man like him?” one person wrote, adding that Hart has already taken accountability for what he has said in the past.

Others users urged fellow followers to keep the focus on Smollett.

Chicago police are currently investigating Smollett’s attack. The actor is currently in good condition in the hospital according to CNN."

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video in the heavily monitored area but said they still need to collect and view more.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container of the liquid that was thrown at the actor.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Mollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglelmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGT issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett, personally. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Speaking with ABC News, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) confirmed that the FBI is helping the department with their current investigation. The CPD is also investigating a letter threat sent to Smollett too. The letter threatening the actor and singer was sent to Fox studio in Chicago on January 22. It contained threatening language and was laced with a powdery substance that investigators believe was Tylenol.

Police said that they “are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.” So far, police have only been able to find one image of Smollett in the area where he says he was attacked. The image was taken from inside a Subway near the location of the attack. Smollett wasn’t with anyone at the time.

“Chicago police detectives continue to investigate serious allegations of a potential racially charged hate crime that took place in the downtown area Tuesday morning around 2am,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said via CNN. “The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras. As of 10pm Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders.”

TMZ reports two white men wearing ski masks violently attacked Smollett. The actor fought back, but was badly beaten and fractured a rib. The men also tied a rope around his neck, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett, 36, was attacked at around 2am local time (08:00 GMT) on Tuesday, according to reports. Police are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

The attackers allegedly beat Smollett, poured a chemical substance on him and placing the rope around his neck as if they were going to hang him, according to the police.

""As of 10pm Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find the video to be able to release a public description of the offenders,"" police said in a statement.

""Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect's vehicle to be able to share.""

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Chicago police added.

As of Wednesday afternoon, police had not yet retrieved video footage of the incident but was widening its search area to find clues.

Smollett, who is gay, stars on the Fox show Empire as character Jamal Lyon, a singer-songwriter who is also gay.

The actor said that his attackers screamed ""MAGA country"" as they got away, a reference to US President Donald Trump's slogan ""make American great again"".

'Terror of racism and homophobia'

Production of Empire was temporarily suspended by 21st Century Fox on Wednesday. The suspension was partially due to harsh weather in Chicago.

Danny Strong, cocreator of Empire, denounced the ""racist and homophobic"" attack on Twitter, describing Smollett as ""a kind and profoundly talented soul"".

""The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,"" Strong wrote.

Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, who recently announced her presidential bid, spoke about the attack on the Senate floor. ""It's outrageous,"" she said. ""I know Jussie, he is one of the kindest, most gentle people I have ever met. It's awful.""

Senator Cory Booker, writing on Twitter, argued that the attack highlighted the need to pass a bill designed to classify lynching as a federal hate crime.

The NAACP civil rights group decried the attack in a statement. ""The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J Trump's racist and xenophobic rhetoric,"" the group wrote.

""It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse.

In the wake of Trump election to president in November 2016, hate crimes and bias incidents skyrocketed, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The (FBI) recorded a 17-percent increase in hate crimes in 2017, according to a report released late last year.

According to the Anti-Defamation League watchdog, 2018 saw 50 murders carried by far-rightists, including white nationalists, neo-Nazis and white supremacists."

Henson and other members of the “Empire” cast have been given around-the-clock security in the wake of the vicious attack on Jussie Smollett.

Smollett told police that thugs yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance over him, believed to be bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck. Police have combed through hours of surveillance footage, but they say they have not been able to find any images of the alleged attackers.

Henson took to social media Wednesday to say, “I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now.”

""Empire"" cast member Terence Howard told ""Good Morning America"" that Smollett is angry about the attack.

“He will forgive these people for what they did. But he won't, and we cannot, forget their actions,” Howard said. “They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.""

Other major names have taken to social media to show solidarity for Smollett.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker tweeted: “To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime – I urge you to pay attention.”

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.

John Legend said he was “sending love” to the actor and hopes he finds peace and justice.

The attack came just a week after Smollett was sent hate mail saying “you will die” along with a crude drawing show him being lynched. There was white powder believed to be Tylenol inside the envelope. The letters were cut from newspapers and magazines. “MAGA” for “Make America Great Again,” President Trump's campaign slogan, was written in one corner

Rich Frankel, vice president of T&M Protection Resources and former FBI agent, reviewed the documents sent to Smollett for Inside Edition. He said that since the letters were cut out, there could be fingerprints on the images that can be used to identify the suspects.

The “Empire” set was dark on Tuesday because of the dangerously cold weather but shooting is expected to resume this week.

Smollett said he is going ahead with a scheduled performance in Los Angeles on Saturday.

Empire star Jussie Smollett is recovering after being brutally attacked by two men in Chicago earlier this week.

According to reports, the men called Smollett “that f–got Empire n–ger” before beating him up and putting a rope around his neck. As the news of Smollett’s horrific encounter spread, some on Twitter attempted to argue that it was the actor’s race, not his sexuality, that made him a target as if it couldn’t possibly have been both.

To be clear, Smollett was assaulted because he is an openly gay, and proud, Black man.

Both of Smollett’s identities are not only hyper-visible because of his role on Empire in which he portrays a gay man, but also because he’s been an outspoken activist for his entire life. Attempting to claim that it was solely his Blackness, but not his gayness that led to the attack disregards the very real threat that Black LGBTQ+ people face every, single day. As my friend and fellow writer, George M. Johnson so eloquently put it, “To be Black queer and visible is to always be in a state of defense.”

Black queer people, much like Black women, have often been asked to prioritize their Blackness over the other parts of themselves for the greater good of the race. In 1928, famed Harlem Renaissance poet Countee Cullen married Nina Yolande Du Bois, daughter of W.E.B. Du Bois, in a lavish ceremony that presented “the symbolic march of young Black America” toward “a new race; a new thought; a new thing rejoicing in a ceremony as old as the world.” Lost in the spectacle was the fact that Cullen was gay, and his marriage to Du Bois would end quickly because of it. All that mattered to the elder Du Bois at the time was presenting a new — and dare I say — bourgeois image of Blackness to the world, not how Cullen (or his daughter for that matter) was trapped in a farce.

But Cullen is far from the only titan of Black American history that has been forced to downplay a vital part of his identity for the supposed greater good of progress — that list is extremely long.

Bayard Rustin, the architect of the March on Washington and a close comrade of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was pushed into the shadows because he refused to hide his sexuality. While Rustin said he and Dr. King never spoke about it, in 1987, Rustin admitted, “My being gay was not a problem for Dr. King, but a problem for the movement.”

Black LGBTQ+ people are often asked to center their race and the challenges associated with being Black in America over their sexuality, which comes with its own dangers. Black queer people are just as likely to be victims of police violence, racism, economic insecurity, and other microaggressions Black folk in general face, but they have the added burden of also being targeted and attacked by some in their own community. For instance, the life expectancy of Black trans women is just 31 years old, while Black LGBTQ+ are “also twice as likely to experience any physical violence, twice as likely to experience discrimination and 1.4 times more likely to experience threats and intimidation during acts of hate violence,” according to the Human Rights Campaign.

Sharon Mor Yosef

The attack against Smollett is a reminder that Black folks — no matter our sexuality — are still being targeted by racist, sexist, and homophobic violence. Because of this, we can’t afford to ask the members of our communities to minimize parts of their identities just to fight against racism, because the other isms are just as dangerous, and often deadly, as well.

As Rustin once said, “One has to fight for justice for all. If I do not fight bigotry wherever it is, bigotry is thereby strengthened. And to the degree that it is strengthened, it will thereby have the power to turn on me.”

Similarly, if Black lives really matter to us, we’ve got to fight for, love on, and support all of the Black folks in our communities, no matter their sexuality or gender."

CHICAGO (AP) - Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said photos of the ""persons of interest"" were to be released later Wednesday evening.

Investigators ""for the most part"" can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Neither Smollett nor his publicist has spoken publicly about the attack.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. The 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.""

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

He is accused of allegedly staging an attack in Chicago with the help of two other people.

News broke yesterday that Empire star Jussie Smollett was hospitalized following a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago. Police said Smollett — a Black, gay, and Jewish actor — was attacked by two white men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and tied a rope around his neck.

The news has not only brought tears to my eyes, it has left me in a state of rage.

Days before this incident, I was grappling with all the incidents affecting Black LGBTQ people and how the world seems to salaciously enjoy watching us suffer at the hands of marginalization and oppression. From news outlets pacifying the incident as a “possible hate crime” to social media users making claims that the incident was set up, I have come to terms with the reality that, although some insist that racism and discrimination are a thing of the past, the world isn’t as welcoming and inclusive as I’d like to believe.

My thoughts are only confirmed when I hear stories like those of Timothy Dean, a Black gay activist, and Gemmel Moore, a Black gay sex worker — both of whom were found dead on separate occasions in the home of white businessman and political fundraiser Ed Buck in what appeared to be accidental overdoses — and wrestle with the pain and frustration of knowing that we may never see justice for their deaths. It’s when I witness the words and actions of individuals like Kevin Hart, who came under fire recently for anti-LGBTQ tweets and homophobic rhetoric in his comedy, that I know the lives of Black LGBTQ people have been and continue to be under attack.

As I have worked in the last day to process what has transpired, I recognize that nothing about this MAGA political climate or its symbolism is new. While the United States seems much more grim since President Donald Trump took office, the history before him has been one that has elevated people like Trump and eradicated Black LGBTQ people, specifically those who live in their Black LGBTQ identity authentically.

Take, for instance, the 1992 death of Marsha P. Johnson, a Black trans woman who led the Stonewall riots and fought back against police brutality. Her death, much like the increasing deaths of Black trans women in the recent years, points to a system actively working to silence the voices of Black LGBTQ people. For years, Black scholars and thought leaders like Bayard Rustin and James Baldwin shed light on the struggles and pains that all Black LGBTQ people face in this country and the actions necessary to create change. Both faced their own subsets of attacks and backlash in their freedom work, proving that while the times have changed, so much has stayed the same.

What happened to Jussie and what has been happening to many other Black LGBTQ people over the years is a symptom of a much larger issue that many refuse to acknowledge. Beyond conversations about the anti-queer discrimination, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and racism that lives at the foundation of U.S. history, is the understanding that the goal of white supremacy is to ensure the marginalized live in a world of fear.

Beyond the dismissals that red MAGA hats are a symbol of hatred, are the ways that folks continue to minimize the hate and pain that Black LGBTQ face as “isolated incidents,” or ask what we might have done to provoke a hateful or racist incident. Even more, it’s the ways that the world tries to fraction out the harmful experiences that Black LGBTQ have, as if oppression can only happen to one identity at one time.

The attack against Jussie was a high profile reminder that no matter how much money you have or how successful you are as a Black LGBTQ person, you have and never will be safe in this climate. Joshua Rivera’s astute point in GQ bears repeating: While the allegation that the attacker yelled “MAGA country” was confirmed Wednesday, no one needs to fact check what we’ve long known: this was MAGA country years before Trump took office.

As I sit and watch both of my identities come under attack almost daily, I recognize how easy it would for me to be silent and stay locked in fear. However, I often think about those who have come before me and garner strength through their work and their actions. I often encourage other Black LGBTQ to think back on the words of writers like Audre Lorde, who reminded us to be deliberate and to be afraid of nothing.

As for those who do not live with my shared pain day in and day out, I challenge everyone to be more than just an “ally” to Jussie’s pain and experiences, but rather to be an accomplice to the change this country needs. If we are ever going to make America great, we have to start by doing the work to make it a safer place for Black LGBTQ people to thrive, not just survive.

Not saying he’s not a decent human being, but it’s been well documented that some cis Black men in Hollywood are struggling with their homophobia (i.e. Kevin Hart). But as we know not all Black men are a monolith, so I digress.

Anyway, as many continue to rally around Smollet, Epps posted a video on Wednesday which accomplished the following things: gave much needed love to Smollett, promoted his upcoming Valentine’s Day comedy show in Chicago and basically said “run up get done up” to the thugs who attacked Smollett if they in any way feel froggy. And he did it all under one minute. What a way to be efficient in your messaging!

“Public service announcement,” Epps began. “I will be in Chicago, performing at the Pavillion on Valentine’s weekend. You cowards that jumped out on Jussie in Chicago, I’ll be there performing in Chicago. I’m going to the same building–imma walk out the same building that Jussie did. I’m begging you, please jump out on me,” he said.

He captioned the post with the following: “Please try that s–t on me!!!!! I don’t claim to be a tough guy but I dare ya’ll cowards!! Get well Jessie!”

Now we’re going to ignore the fact that he pronounced and spelled Smollet’s name wrong, but the love behind the message is there!

In the Black community, it’s pretty much like this: don’t ever wage a hate crime against one of our own. Epps served as the big brother who is ready, willing and able to knock the breaks off the cowards who assaulted Smollett.

A large part of me really hopes that the perps do run up on Epps just so that we can all take part in watching this go down. And while I am usually a non-violent person, under these circumstances, I’m feeling more Malcolm than Martin today. It’s not right, but it’s okay."

Empire lead Terrence Howard appeared on Good Morning America on Wednesday morning (January 30) to condemn the attack and pledge even more support to his 36-year-old co-star.

“I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,” Howard said, updating the press on Smollett’s condition and state of mind.

“But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t and we cannot forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance. Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood,” Howard continued.

“He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family — you know, the Fox family, the Empire family, the Lyon family — were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.”

Elsewhere, a distraught Lee Daniels admitted he had to compose himself before taking to social media and vowed to be right by Smollett’s side A-S-A-P.

“You didn’t deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die faggot’ … ‘nigger’ or whatever they said to you,” the director exclaimed. “You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows we are united on a united front.”

Chicago police are investigating what they’re calling “possible racially charged assault and battery” and are currently coming up empty in their search for surveillence video in the surrounding area.

TMZ is also reporting tragic irony that Smollett declined to travel with additional security just days before the attack.

Smollett is expected to return to taping Empire soon with minor adjustments made to accommodate his transition. As of press time, his February 2 concert in Los Angeles is still on the books.

Outside of the extended Empire, a host of movie stars, musicians and even politicians also spoke out against hate.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows the alleged attack, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the crime scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Mollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that was thrown at the actor.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment after the alleged attack and his manager called police from the apartment about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Mollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglelmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Rep. Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

The alleged attack sparked outrage and a flood of support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, who called the attack on the actor she knows personally “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the most famous examples of the police department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

According to E!, the network decided to delay work on the series, as well as its forthcoming legal drama Proven Innocent, as a result of the extreme weather brought by the polar vortex in Chicago on Wednesday. The Windy City has been hit with below-freezing temperatures, with a windchill warning that temperatures may feel as low as -55 degrees Fahrenheit, as a result of the storm.

The timing of the halt on Empire, however, coincides with what has already been an upsetting week for the cast and creatives.

Smollett, who portrays Jamal Lyon on the series, was the victim of a brutal assault late Monday night. According to the Chicago police, the actor was attacked by two men who fractured his rib, poured chemicals on him and tied a noose around his neck while shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Smollett's co-stars as well as other members of the Hollywood community and activists have spoken up to offer support to Smollett as well as demand justice for the assault. Chicago P.D. confirmed that the incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

NEW YORK (AP) — TV star and musician Jussie Smollett, who alleges he was the victim of a brutal racial and homophobic attack , is a former child star who grew up to become a champion of LGBT rights and one of the few actors to play a black gay character on primetime TV.

Smollet’s breakthrough came aboard the hip-hop drama “Empire,” playing Jamal Lyon, a talented R&B singer struggling to earn his father’s approval and find his place in his dad’s music empire. It became one of the biggest network shows to star a gay black character.

Smollett, one of the young stars of “The Mighty Ducks” film in 1992, appeared in Ridley Scott’s science fiction film “Alien: Covenant” in 2017. The third of six children, he also starred in with his siblings in the 1994 ABC sitcom “On Our Own,” along with sisters Jurnee and Jazz and brothers Jake, Jocqui and Jojo.

Other film roles include Rob Reiner’s “North,” playing Langston Hughes in “Marshall” and playing the son of Halle Berry and Danny Glover in “Queen.” He also guest-starred on “The Mindy Project.”

Smollett came out as gay in 2015 in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, saying, “There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in.” In response to the alleged attack, the talk show host wrote on Twitter: “I’m sending him and his family so much love today.”

His work on “Empire” turbo-boosted his career, earning Emmy and Grammy nominations. His 10-track debut album, “Sum of My Music,” was released independently on his own label, Music of Sound, despite interest from major labels. He won the trophy for best supporting actor in a drama series at the 2017 NAACP Images Awards.

Smollett joined The Human Rights Campaign’s Equality Rocks campaign, joined other “Empire” cast members in an ad endorsing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and his music videos have explored social issues.

One video for the song “F.U.W.” highlights injustices, from human and LGBT rights to religious and racial prejudices. A woman wears a hijab in one scene, a boy wears a hoodie in another and four women put their fists up as they stand in front of the words, “My body, my rights.” In one scene, a wheelchair runs over a Donald Trump mask, an apparent reference to Trump’s alleged mocking of a disabled reporter.

“This song is for the oppressed. That’s why I feel like people will connect with it because it is very broad, because oppression is so broad,” he told The Associated Press in 2017. In his Twitter bio, Smollett wrote: “I am simply here to help save the world. Nothing is more important than love.”

Celebrities from Oscar-winner Viola Davis to supermodel Naomi Campbell were among those sharing support for Smollett. Lee Daniels, Steve Harvey, Janelle Monae, Jada Pinkett Smith and Kevin Hart all took to social media to send their best wishes. The cast of the Broadway show “Choir Boy” dedicated its Tuesday performance to Smollett."

(Tristan Perry)

After a violent homophobic attack in Austin, Texas, locals have set up a ‘Rainbow Patrol’ to protect the city’s LGBT+ community.

Local LGBT+ people in the city decided to form the group after a brutal January 19 attack on a gay couple, Spencer Deehring and Tristan Perry.

The Texas gay couple were branded “faggots” before being kicked and punched to the ground by a group of men, who left them both with horrific injuries.

Austin Rainbow Patrol vows to protect local LGBT+ community

The attack, which was only the latest violent homophobic incident in the city, has spurred the creation of a ‘Rainbow Patrol’ to keep the city’s gayborhood safe.

The volunteer-led gayborhood watch group explained: “In the wake of recent hate crimes against our LGBTQ+ community downtown, we are forming a volunteer group to walk the parts of [Austin, near gay venues].

“This is a positive, inclusive, non-violent, non-confrontational, de-escalation, distraction, and protection squad that can bring some light back to our downtown: bright shirts, whistles, and flashlights.

“Austin Police Department is aware of this effort and grateful for more eyes and ears.”

Speaking to local news outlet KVUE, the Rainbow Patrol founder Colin Acock said that so far 22 volunteers had come forward to be part of the group.

There have been no arrests following the attack on Deehring and Perry, which is being treated as a suspected hate crime.

Speaking about the violent attack, Acock said: “It sparked something very deep in me and very personal. I got fed up, and I was like, ‘You know, it’s time to bring back the rainbow guard.’

“It’s supposed to be our playground, and it feels like there’s some bullies on our playground, and that’s not how we do that here.”

“It feels like there’s some bullies on our playground, and that’s not how we do that here.” —Colin Acock

He added: “If everyone keeps telling us that we’re the best city in the country, then those sorts of things shouldn’t be happening.”

Austin Rainbow Patrol want to reclaim the night

The group went out on their first patrol on Saturday (January 26), donning rainbows and high-vis vests to take back the night.

James Huddleson, who went on patrol with the group, wrote: “What happened to those two guys is unacceptable not just in Austin, but anywhere period.

“We are a peaceful, inclusive and non-violent Patrol, if we can give anyone peace of mind to walk safely to their destination without fear is a plus!

“Let’s work together to bring back hope to all around! We need more people to join cause strength in numbers!”

Acock put out a further call for volunteers after Empire actor Jussie Smollett was reportedly targeted in a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago.

He added: “Jussie, I will not stand this any longer. No more. We started this here. I’m going to start here. ANYONE can stand up and do this. No more.”"

Bush that sits in Hampton University’s newly unveiled Legacy Park his causing a heated objection with at least one congressional lawmaker.

On Sunday, the historically Black university hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony for Hampton’s Founder’s Day to officially unveil Legacy Park, which was commissioned by the university’s trustees.

But Rep. William Lacy Clay, a Democrat from St. Louis however said he plans to ask the Congressional Black Caucus to speak out against the sculpture of Bush. Bush has a statue along with civil rights figures Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr. former President Barack Obama, as well as others.

Clay believes Bush’s history of resistance to civil rights makes him disqualified to be honored with a sculpture about greats like Parks, King and Obama.

“When you think about the legacy of President George H. W. Bush it is not one that you can hold up as someone who believed in equal justice for all,” Clay told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

“It is a legacy that really damaged the African American community, and what I mean by that is his appointment of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, to replace a giant like Thurgood Marshall,” he continued. “I think that was so insulting to the African American and to the country as a whole, because (Thomas) couldn’t hold a candle to Thurgood Marshall, as far as civil liberties, freedom, equal rights, equal justice. He’s contrary to all that.”

But Hampton University president Dr. William R. Harvey in December, defended the statue.

“I believe in giving people their credit when it is due.”

“President Bush was not only a good friend of mine, but he was an extraordinary person who believed it was crucial that African Americans have access to education,” Harvey said. “I think that’s something that we must acknowledge.”

In 1989, Harvey pointed out to the Philadelphia Tribune in a December interview, HBCUs received $776 million in federal funds. In 1990, they got $894 million. Bush was in office from 1989 to 1993. He also founded the United Negro College Fund chapter while a student at Yale University and eventually became Texas UNCF chairman.

However, the former president’s civil rights record still weighs heavily in the minds of others.

“I must remind you that President Bush’s record on civil rights was one of the worst in the history of U.S. Presidents,'” said William L. “Bill” Clay, a former congressman and Clay’s father. “For three decades in public service, he refused to come face-to-face with his paradoxical conflict of duplicity in matters of race. He steadfastly and vigorously opposed any specific proposal to ameliorate the inequitable, bigoted treatment of black citizens.”"

Chicago PD are treating the vicious attack on the star, who had bleach poured on him and a noose tied around his neck, as a 'possible hate crime', in a statement to E!News.

'Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,' said CPD Chief Spokesman Anthony Gugliemi.

The actor, who came out as gay to Ellen in 2015, was attacked at 2am on Tuesday in Chicago by two men in ski masks, ThatGrapeJuice.Net reports.

Fox, who produce Jussie's show Empire, also stood behind the young actor following his Chicago attack

Reports of the incident state that Smollett was walking from a local Subway sandwich shop when the two men started yelling homophobic and racial slurs to get his attention, including: 'Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?'

The two then started beating on the actor while pouring bleach on him.

A noose was said to have been tied around his neck during the attack.

Sources close to the singer told TMZ that both of the men were white and yelled that 'this is MAGA country.'

Smollett was admitted to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital but has since been released. He suffered a fractured rib, during the attack, and is said to have put up a fight when he was beaten."

Despite Chicago P.D. stating that they have scoured through hundreds of hours of security camera footage and haven’t come up with any evidence supporting Smollett’s claims, Hollywood rushed to blame President Trump and the right for the attack.

Smollett, who also happens to be a liberal, anti-Trump activist, claimed that two white guys in ski masks beat him up, put a noose around his neck and scoured bleach on him, all the while shouting racial, homophobic slurs and saying “This is MAGA country.” In downtown Chicago, at frigid temperatures, at 2 AM in the morning. The only proof of this encounter thus far is the actor’s word, yet Hollywood came out to blast Trump and his followers on social media:

Activist and director Rob Reiner tweeted that Trump was to blame because he “injected hatred into the American bloodstream:”

The horrific attack on Jussie Smollett has no place in a decent human loving society. Homophobia existed before Trump, but there is no question that since he has injected his hatred into the American bloodstream, we are less decent,less human,& less loving. No intolerance! No DT! — Rob Reiner (@robreiner) January 30, 2019

Actor Billy Eichner tweeted that even if there was no proof, he still doesn’t doubt Trump supporters were capable of doing such a heinous act:

Time will tell if Jussie’s attackers shouted MAGA or not but there is no part of me that doubts that Trump and MAGA culture have encouraged and emboldened these types of attacks and that is truly fucking unforgivable. — billy eichner (@billyeichner) January 29, 2019

Grey’s Anatomy star Ellen Pompeo directly blamed Trump followers for the attack, on her Instagram account, which has 5.9 million followers:

“These punks ...these haters ...who are filled with fear and insecurity who continue to spread hate and violence in the name of this administration must be called out at every turn,” she seethed.

Cher, with her ever-coherent ramblings tweeted blame at ""NPR, VILLAINY, RACISM, HOMOPHOBIA, PROMOTED BY MOST INFAMOUS CLOWN IN WORLD IS THE POISON THAT KILLS AMERICANS WHITE ONLY IS NOT RIGHT...GOP GOES DOWN WITH SHIP.""

Fellow Empire actor Taraji P. Henson seemed to refer to Trump as “the devil” and his supporters, “his minions” in an Instagram post. She wrote, “I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now….”

Actress Regina King tweeted that hateful bigots were being ""emboldened"" right now:

Yes Viola! Hate filled people are being emboldened and we should take it personally. Special prayers up to Jussie and anyone else who has had to witness hate on this level https://t.co/wv8UFxRVkx — Regina King (@ReginaKing) January 29, 2019

Dozens more celebrities came out blasting America’s “hatred” towards gays and black people, while not name-dropping Trump or conservatives, specifically.

Democrats all came out with similar expressions of horror and disgust as well, some directly pointing fingers at Trump, such as anti-Semitic Democrat Rashida Tlaib, who blamed “the right wing:”

""When one of the most famous black and gay men in America is not safe, the message is clearer than it has ever been."" The dangerous lies spewing from the right wing is killing & hurting our people.

The production pause is due to the extreme cold currently enveloping Chicago, thanks to the Polar Vortex, per a report from E! News. No additional info on production scheduling was made available, except that both shows had been temporarily halted due to local weather.

Chicago broke a record at 21 degrees below zero for the day, not far off from its all-time low of -27 back in 1985. As of Wednesday, USA Today reports that authorities have linked six deaths to the weather event. In the Chicago suburb of Libertyville, a man was hit and killed by a snow plow.

Security on the Chicago set of Empire was reportedly expanded last week in light of a ""threatening homophobic letter"" to star Jussie Smollett. Days later, Smollett was allegedly attacked after walking back to his apartment from a nearby Subway restaurant. ""The alleged assailants made racially charged comments to the victim implying that they knew he was a star from the show,"" a police rep told the Chicago Sun-Times Wednesday.

Many have joined together to condemn the alleged racist and homophobic attack, which is being investigated as a possible hate crime, including Empire's Lee Daniels and 20th Century Fox. ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,"" the studio said in a statement. ""The entire studio, network. and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate—and especially against one of our own.""

Previously, it was reported that the Empire shooting schedule would be ""reshuffled"" due to the attack. Smollett's Feb. 2 show at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, however, is currently set to take place as scheduled."

The Empire star was attacked by two men who allegedly threw bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck before he was able to escape. Smollett publicly came out as gay in 2015 and received some hate mail on the set of the hit TV series earlier this week. Police are investigating to see whether or not the note and the attack are related.

Comedian Kevin Hart was originally announced as the host of this year's Academy Awards, only to step down after some of his old anti-gay tweets were unearthed. The comedian had joked that his biggest fear was that his son would end up gay. Hart originally refused to apologize for his past comments, noting that he had already done so, which created an even bigger backlash since the apology could not be found. Hart ended up apologizing, but he is now facing criticism after posting support for Jussie Smollett on social media due to the comedian's past comments on the LGBTQ community. Hart had this to say.

""Sending prayers your way Jussie Smollett... This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards... this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why...""

Seconds after posting the support tweet, Kevin Hart had people questioning his motives for doing so. Most people have pointed out that Hart's previous comments about the LGBTQ community are a part of the larger problem in our society. One person asked, ""so are we now admitting that it's never ever okay to joke about being gay?"" Others are telling Hart to forget about his thoughts and prayers and think about his own actions and words.

Another person said, ""You should have just sat there and ate your food, Kevin. Ain't nobody trying to watch you use this for an op."" While there are plenty of people piling on Kevin Hart right now, he has plenty of supporters and he even responded to the hate. It seems that the comedian has turned over a new leaf after going through the Academy Awards debacle. He explains.

""Operation spread love is in full effect damn it. I don't condone or believe in hate, in fact I despise it. Hate makes me sick to my stomach... It's pointless. Cowards & weak individuals embrace it. I choose love... I love all of you. I challenge the rest of the world 2 do the same.""

Even as Kevin Hart doubles down on his anti-hate comments, many people are still calling his Jussie Smollett condolences hypocritical. Whatever the case may be, Hart was expressing his feelings about a scary potential hate crime. Trying to throw bleach on someone while applying a noose and allegedly stating that Smollett is in ""MAGA country,"" is horrific. Hart is attempting to right his wrongs, but it appears that some people are not ready for him to redeem himself at this time. You can see the original tweets below, thanks to Kevin Hart's Twitter account.

Smollet’s breakthrough came aboard the hip-hop drama “Empire,” playing Jamal Lyon, a talented R&B singer struggling to earn his father’s approval and find his place in his dad’s music empire. It became one of the biggest network shows to star a gay black character.

Smollett, one of the young stars of “The Mighty Ducks” film in 1992, appeared in Ridley Scott’s science fiction film “Alien: Covenant” in 2017. The third of six children, he also starred in with his siblings in the 1994 ABC sitcom “On Our Own,” along with sisters Jurnee and Jazz and brothers Jake, Jocqui and Jojo.

Other film roles include Rob Reiner’s “North,” playing Langston Hughes in “Marshall” and playing the son of Halle Berry and Danny Glover in “Queen.” He also guest-starred on “The Mindy Project.”

Smollett came out as gay in 2015 in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, saying, “There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in.” In response to the alleged attack, the talk show host wrote on Twitter: “I’m sending him and his family so much love today.”

His work on “Empire” turbo-boosted his career, earning Emmy and Grammy nominations. His 10-track debut album, “Sum of My Music,” was released independently on his own label, Music of Sound, despite interest from major labels. He won the trophy for best supporting actor in a drama series at the 2017 NAACP Images Awards.

Smollett joined The Human Rights Campaign’s Equality Rocks campaign, joined other “Empire” cast members in an ad endorsing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and his music videos have explored social issues.

One video for the song “F.U.W.” highlights injustices, from human and LGBT rights to religious and racial prejudices. A woman wears a hijab in one scene, a boy wears a hoodie in another and four women put their fists up as they stand in front of the words, “My body, my rights.” In one scene, a wheelchair runs over a Donald Trump mask, an apparent reference to Trump’s alleged mocking of a disabled reporter.

“This song is for the oppressed. That’s why I feel like people will connect with it because it is very broad, because oppression is so broad,” he told The Associated Press in 2017. In his Twitter bio, Smollett wrote: “I am simply here to help save the world. Nothing is more important than love.”

Lee Daniels, Steve Harvey, Janelle Monae, Jada Pinkett Smith and Kevin Hart all took to social media to send their best wishes.

His Empire co-star, Terrence Howard, is speaking out about his on-screen son’s state of mind following the reported attack.

According to a January 30 report by People, Jussie Smollett is “angry” after he was reportedly attacked by two men wearing ski masks, who allegedly beat him and put a noose around his neck. The purported attack came after the Empire star had apparently received a threatening letter of a racist and homophobic nature.

Now, Smollett’s co-star, Terrence Howard, is opening up about Jussie’s attack, how he’s doing following the shocking crime, and what he believes will be the next step for the actor following the attack.

“I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry, but I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance,” Howard told the publication.

“Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood. He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family — you know, the Fox family, the Empire family, the Lyon family — were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today,” Terrence added of the shocking and sad incident.

The Chicago police released a statement about the attack, revealing that Jussie Smollett was walking the streets around 2 a.m. when two unknown offenders apparently got his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs to him.

The police reveal that Jussie claims that the men then began to hit him with their hands, and threw a chemical liquid on him — one which is thought to be bleach. The assailants then reportedly wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene. Smollett is said to have transported himself to the hospital, and was released shortly after.

The outlet reports that there are currently no leads on suspects in the attack at this time, and that there have been no arrests made. Jussie was by himself at the time of the attack, after reportedly refusing security after getting the threatening letter.

Many celebrities have taken to social media to wish Jussie Smollett a speedy recovery, send their love and prayers, and to speak out about the injustice and intolerance still facing the country today."

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

The deadly arctic deep freeze wreaking havoc across the United States has left at least 12 people dead with record-breaking low temperatures halting postal services in the Midwest and cancelling more than 2,600 flights.

Two people died in Detroit, Michigan after temperatures started plummeting late Tuesday as forecasters issued grave warnings that one of the coldest spells in history would be life-threatening.

Police found a man's body across the street from his home in the Detroit area on Wednesday. He was not wearing a hat or gloves and wasn't dressed for below-zero temperatures. A 70-year-old man was also found dead in Detroit in front of a neighbor's home on Wednesday.

University of Iowa student, Gerald Belz, 18, was found outside an academic building around 3am Wednesday. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.

The polar vortex in the Midwest came on the heels of major Winter Storm Jayden that dumped up to a foot of snow on the region over the weekend and was to blame for at least five deaths.

A 55-year-old man froze to death in his Milwaukee garage after he collapsed shoveling snow, a man was fatally struck by a snow plow in Chicago, a nine-year-old died in an Iowa pile up and a young couple were killed when their SUV struck another on a snowy road in northern Indiana.

Officials have warned that the freezing temperatures will only become more life-threatening overnight on Wednesday.

Forecasters advised against breathing deeply or talking while outside and warned that frostbite and hypothermia issues could occur within seconds.

Temperatures plunged to as low as minus 42F in Park Rapids, Minnesota, minus 31F in Fargo, North Dakota and minus 27F in Minneapolis. In Chicago, temperatures were still dropping after plunging early Wednesday to minus 19F, breaking the day's previous record low set in 1966. Temperatures are expected drop as low as negative 28F in Chicago as the day progresses. Wind chills in northern Illinois made it feel as cold as negative 57F.

In comparison, temperatures in parts of the Midwest were lower Wednesday than in Antarctica, where the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station hit negative 25F.

The National Weather Service forecast for Wednesday night predicted temperatures in Chicago as low as minus 28, with wind chills to minus 50. Detroit's outlook was for Wednesday overnight lows around minus 15, with wind chills dropping to minus 40.

Governors in Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan have all declared emergencies as the worst of the cold threatened on Wednesday.

'We need everyone to do your part and make sure you and your families are prepared,' said Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.

The bitter cold is the result of a split in the polar vortex that allowed temperatures to plunge much further south in North America than normal.

'These are actually a public health risk and you need to treat it appropriately,' Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Tuesday. 'They are life-threatening conditions and temperatures.'

Officials in large Midwestern cities including Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago and Detroit were desperately trying to get the homeless off the streets.

Minneapolis charitable groups that operate warming places and shelters expanded hours and capacity, and ambulance crews handled all outside calls as being potentially life-threatening, according to Hennepin County Emergency Management Director Eric Waage.

MetroTransit said it wouldn't remove people from buses if they were riding them simply to stay warm, and weren't being disruptive.

Emanuel said Chicago was turning five buses into makeshift warming centers moving around the city, some with nurses aboard, to encourage the homeless to come in from the cold. About 160 warming centers were opened in the city.

'We're bringing the warming shelters to them, so they can stay near all of their stuff and still warm up,' said Cristina Villarreal, spokeswoman for the city's Department of Family and Support Services.

Shelters, churches and city departments in Detroit worked together to help get vulnerable people out of the cold, offering the message to those who refused help that 'you're going to freeze or lose a limb,' said Terra DeFoe, a senior adviser to Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.

Nineteen-year-old Deontai Jordan and dozens of others found refuge from the cold in the basement of a church in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

'You come here, you can take a nap, you can snack, you can use the bathroom, you might even be able to shower,' he said. 'And then they're feeding you well. Not to mention they give out clothes, they give out shoes, they give out socks.'

American Indian tribes in the Upper Midwest were doing what they could to help members in need with heating supplies. Many people on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in the Dakotas live in housing that's decades old and in disrepair, or in emergency government housing left over from southern disasters such as hurricanes.

'They aren't made for this (northern) country. The cold just goes right through them,' said Elliott Ward, the tribe's emergency response manager.

The extreme cold was 'a scary situation' for the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, said Chris Fairbanks, manager of the northern Minnesota tribe's energy assistance program.

It's so cold in Minnesota they can't deliver beer without it FREEZING in trucks The deadly arctic deep freeze has prompted beer distributors to halt deliveries of beer in Minnesota. Distributors have stopped delivering in the Twin Cities, down south and out west until the weather improves. It comes after kegged beer froze while out for delivery on Tuesday, and temperatures fell as low as negative 26 degrees Fahrenheit, with a wind chill of 53 below zero, in Minneapolis. Beer can freeze at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on its alcohol content, and temperatures across the Midwest are currently much lower than that. Advertisement

'We have many, many calls coming in. We're just swamped trying to get everybody what they need,' she said.

The cold weather was even affecting beer deliveries, with a pair of western Wisconsin distributors saying they would delay or suspend shipments for fear that beer would freeze in their trucks.

The unusually frigid weather is attributed to a sudden warming far above the North Pole. A blast of warm air from misplaced Moroccan heat last month made the normally super chilly air temperatures above the North Pole rapidly increase.

That split the polar vortex into pieces, which then started to wander, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research.

One of those polar vortex pieces is responsible for the subzero temperatures across the Midwest this week.

Minnesota's Xcel Energy reported that equipment failures on power poles has led to outages throughout the Twin Cities. The outages started around 5.40pm and more than 3,000 people were still without power at 11pm Tuesday evening, according to CBS Minnesota.

The National Weather Service (NWS) Twin Cities reported that the area is experiencing the coldest temperatures since 1996.

'These are VERY DANGEROUS conditions and can lead to frostbite on exposed skin in as little as five minutes where wind chill values are below -50,' the NWS tweeted. 'Best thing you can do is limit your time outside.'

A wind chill of minus 25 can freeze skin within 15 minutes, according to the service.

The NWS have even warned that people should avoid taking deep breaths and talking outside to ensure lungs are protected from the severely cold air.

A lone pedestrian crosses the Chicago River early Wednesday as a deadly arctic deep freeze enveloped the Midwest with record-breaking temperatures

Temperatures in almost a dozen states stretching more than 1,200 miles from the Dakotas to Ohio were forecast to be the coldest in a generation, if not on record.

'One of the coldest arctic air mass intrusions in recent memory is surging south into the Upper Midwest before spreading across much of the eastern two-thirds of the country,' the NWS said.

WHAT IS THE POLAR VORTEX? The polar vortex is an atmospheric circulation pattern that sits high above the poles, in a layer of the atmosphere called the stratosphere. This structure can weaken as a result of abnormal warming in the poles, causing it to split off into smaller ‘sister vortices’ that may travel outside of their typical range. The split higher up in the atmosphere could eventually cause a similar phenomenon to ‘drip’ down to the troposphere – the layer of the atmosphere closest to the surface, where most of our weather takes place. A split in the polar vortex can give rise to both sudden and delayed effects, much of which involves declining temperatures and extreme winter weather in the Eastern US along with Northern and Western Europe.

'Expect frigid temperatures, bitterly cold and life-threatening wind chills, likely leading to widespread record lows and low maximum temperatures from the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.'

The NWS forecast temperatures between -10 to -40 degrees Fahrenheit by Wednesday across the Midwest, with wind chills making it seem as cold as -65 degrees Fahrenheit in one area of Minnesota.

Scientists say climate change is causing more extreme weather, and one theory for polar vortex chills is that arctic air currents usually trapped around the North Pole are weakened and dislodged by a warming climate.

President Donald Trump used the occasion to again voice skepticism about climate change, tweeting: 'What the hell is going on with Global Waming? (sic) Please come back fast, we need you!'

But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates NWS, tweeted: 'Winter storms don't prove that global warming isn't happening.'

The NOAA also linked to a 2015 explanatory article in their tweet.

The painfully cold weather system is expected to ease Thursday, though temperatures could still tumble to record lows in some places before the region begins to thaw out.

Disruptions caused by the cold will persist, too, including power outages and canceled flights and trains.

Crews in Detroit will need days to repair water mains that burst Wednesday, and other pipes can still burst in persistent subzero temperatures.

Before the worst of the cold begins to lift, the NWS said Chicago could hit lows early Thursday that break the city's record of minus 27F set on January 20, 1985.

Some nearby isolated areas could see temperatures as low as minus 40F. That would break the Illinois record of minus 36F, set in Congerville on January 5, 1999.

As temperatures bounce back into the single digits Thursday and into the comparative balmy 20s by Friday, more people were expected to return to work.

The images came from a surveillance camera and show persons of interest wanted for questioning, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

A community alert with photos was being prepared.

Police said they had not made arrests in the reported attack on Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on Fox's Empire.

Guglielmi said the pictures, in ""really dark"" frames, do not show the attack or any contact between them and Smollett.

""They are outside on a street walking. They are in the area that we have determined it could have taken place ... in the time and the area,"" Guglielmi said. ""It certainly leads us to have questions for them.""

Now, detectives will backtrack to find them.

""They still have a lot more cameras to look at,"" Guglielmi said. ""But now that we've got potential persons of interest, the focus will be following their paths. Where did they come from and where did they go?""

Police say two people approached Smollett about 2am on Tuesday as he was walking in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street and got his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett is black and openly gay.

Smollett was hit and an unknown chemical substance was poured on him, according to police. A rope was wrapped around Smollett's neck before the attackers fled the scene, police said.

Smollett also told police during a follow up interview that they said to him: ""This is MAGA country,"" during the alleged attack.

According to police radio traffic, a dispatcher asked officers to check on a battery report from a caller in an apartment in the 300 block of East North Water Street just after 2:30 a.m. A friend of the actor told responding officers that ""a noose was placed over the friend's neck."" Police said Smollett took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital and is said to be in ""good condition.""

After being treated for lacerations to his face, Smollett did not spend the night at the hospital, Guglielmi said.

News of the attack was first reported by TMZ.com and entertainment site ThatGrapeJuice.net."

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the “thin rope” around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

The FBI and over a dozen police detectives have been assigned the case.

Guglielmi said that media had claimed that the alleged attackers shouted: “This is MAGA country.” Smollett did not give this information to the police during the first interview. However, he told detectives in a supplemental interview that it was said.

Police are testing the chemical that Smollett reported the attackers threw on him, and have not confirmed as of yet the substance. They also have not been able to find the container used to hold the liquid.

Chicago police broadened their search to include the Chicago riverfront. They have watched hundreds of hours of video from private surveillance cameras, and cannot find any video that shows the two alleged assailants. The only images police were able to obtain of Smollett was from security cameras outside the Subway Sandwich restaurant, and Smollett was alone.

Guglielmi also mentioned the Chicago Police Department after viewing security cameras in the area were unable to identify the vehicle the alleged assailants used to flee the scene.

Smollett reported in the early morning on Tuesday, Jan. 29, 2019, he arrived in Chicago from New York. Around 2 a.m. CT, he went to a Subway Sandwich shop to get something to eat. As he walked home on East North Lower Water Street, he was allegedly approached by two white men, who were wearing ski masks who yelled: “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****?”

Smollet fought the assailants, and they fractured his rib, poured a chemical on him and wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck. It was also reported allegedly the attackers yelled as the fled the scene: “This is MAGA country.”

No decision has been made yet on when production will resume. That no doubt largely depends on just how long the cold snap will last.

“Chicago Fire” and “Chicago Med” are still in production, since both Dick Wolf series are filming on soundstages. But “Chicago P.D.” – which was supposed to shoot on location Wednesday – has been put on pause for the sake of the cast and crew’s safety, according to an NBCUniversal spokesperson. The plan is to resume filming “P.D.” on Friday, though that may change, depending on the weather.

Temperatures dropped as low as 26 degrees below zero in some parts of the Chicagoland area early Wednesday, with wind chills in the minus 40s to minus 50s, according to the National Weather Service. At Chicago’s O’Hare airport, northwest of the city, wind chill fell to 52 degrees below zero as temps hit 23 below zero.

The NWS said to expect Thursday to start with “all-time record cold temperatures” in Chicago, with wind chill easing up by the morning though likely still at “dangerous levels” of cold. More snow is expected.

Separately, “Empire” has been impacted by the assault and hospitalization of star Jussie Smollett on Tuesday that is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Whether you’re white, Black, Muslim or straight, the attacks on Jussie should not only enrage you but open a new threshold of concern. If arguably the most famous black gay man in Hollywood is subject to hate and bigotry, what does it say for everyone else?

Last week, actress and liberal activist Alyssa Milano compared President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” to white hoods worn by members of the Ku Klux Klan and got torn apart. Today, unfortunately so, it seems like she was right.

We’ve seen it in synagogues, in churches and nightclubs. We saw it in Charlottesville and now we’re seeing it again. New hate crime data from the FBI says there’s been a 17 percent spike in the number of hate crimes reported nationwide, rising from 6,121 in 2016 to 7,175 in 2017.

After the Attack the New York City Anti-Violence Project released a statement saying “Jussie is not alone” in his experience. Gay Black men are among “some of the most vulnerable to violence in the LGBTQ community.”

Which is why we all should be engaged with something to say. Empire co-creator Lee Daniels reacted to Tuesday’s news, saying, in part,

“It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie, you are my son. You didn’t deserve, nor anyone deserves, to have a noose put around your neck; to have bleach thrown on you … you are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.”

Fox said in a statement:

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stand united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

And they only make up a few.

Jussie is my friend – a very talented & beautiful human being. It is so hurtful that homophobic haters would dare hurt someone so loving and giving.

Even if right-winged supporters don’t fully align with Trump surely by now they can at least acknowledge what its come to symbolize. Furthermore, this should serve as a cautionary tale for any and everyone that doesn’t fit the MAGA mold.

This is not exclusively an LGBTQ issue or exclusively a race issue. This is a humanitarian issue and until we all take it up as one, worse will only happen."

Evan Agostini/Invision / AP

CHICAGO — Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early-morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

Investigators ""for the most part"" can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the ""thin rope"" around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.""

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

Fox’s Empire has halted production, at least temporarily.

The move comes as temperatures in Chicago, where Empire is filmed, have plummeted to -22 degrees, with a wind chill in the -40s. The Windy City temperatures rival parts of Siberia, the Arctic, and is even reportedly colder than recent temperatures on Mars. At least seven have been reported dead in the Midwest due to the recent Polar Vortex.

Sources say the work stoppage on Empire’s fifth season is not related to the attack on star Jussie Smollett. According to a Chicago police report, the actor was walking on a street early Tuesday morning when he was attacked by two assailants yelling racial and homophobic slurs. The assailants also allegedly poured a chemical substance on the actor and put a rope around his neck. Smollett went to the hospital after the attack and an investigation is ongoing.

Production on another show, Fox’s freshman drama Proven Innocent, was also shut down.

Previously, Empire producer 20th Century Fox Television released this statement about the incident: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

According to Deadline, trauma counselors and a SAG-AFTRA representative will be made available on the show’s set to talk with and listen to cast, crew, and producers and will continue to maintain a presence on set over the coming few weeks. And according to E! News, security on the show will be increased.

If you think the manure-spreaders of sensationalism who masquerade as ethical practitioners of journalism learned anything from last week's MAGA-bashing Covington Catholic High School hoax, I have three words for you:

Ha, ha, ha.

On Tuesday morning, uncorroborated claims by actor Jussie Smollett that he was the victim of a “brutal” hate crime by Trump supporters in Chicago went viral across social media. Entertainment rag TMZ.com first splashed “exclusive” headlines that the Empire cast member was “beaten by MAGA backers” in a “homophobic attack” at around 2 a.m. in Chicago. If you have no idea what Empire is or who Smollett is, join the club. The TV star is apparently a vocal critic of Trump and attacked ""45 and all his white hooded cohorts"" on Instagram last week.

But I digress.

Within minutes, the gossip site's squib on the TV star's alleged victimization trended on Twitter and rocketed up to USA Today, Variety, CBS, CNN and The New York Times. The Fishwrap of Record breathlessly reported lurid details of two people who ""wrapped rope around his neck,"" which multiple outlets characterized as a “noose.” A police statement providing incident background stated that “the offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” according to Smollett. Multiple websites reported that the substance was bleach.

This is truly horrible, if true. But color me cautious and skeptical. TMZ initially reported that Smollett had exited a Subway chain restaurant near his luxury apartment when accosted by the racist, homophobic assailants, who allegedly recognized him from his work on ""Empire."" Allegedly, Smollett received a hate mail with the word “MAGA” on it addressed to him and sent to his studio in Chicago last week. If this was a premeditated attack, the FBI should get to the bottom of it.

But oddities and discrepancies abound:

TMZ quoted one of the “MAGA country” attackers who allegedly hurled epithets at Smollett: “Aren't you that f----t Empire–----?”

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces wander around the upscale Streeterville neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about “MAGA country?”

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces have ever heard of Empire, could recognize Jussie Smollett, or know or care anything about his sexuality?

Despite TMZ's claim that Smollett had the “hell beat outta him” and attackers “broke his ribs” plus subjected him to a chemical attack, an ambulance was not called and he instead “self-transported” to the hospital. CWB Chicago, a local public safety watchdog site, reported on police dispatch records documenting that Smollett's friend “Frank” refused EMS services for Smollett; no mention of bleach was made; ""no or minor injury"" was observed; and “officers never sent a ‘flash’ message with offender descriptions to field units.”

Weird.

Another assertion not included in the CPD's initial press release on the incident: Any mention of “MAGA supporters” or any mention of the race of the alleged assailants. Police clarified that they had not received any official information backing TMZ reporter Charles Latibeaudiere's claim, which he attributed to sources close to Smollett, that the alleged attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country.”

Nor had the police corroborated that the attackers were white, since Smollett had told them their faces and hands were both covered. After launching a search for surveillance video and potential witnesses, the police department reported late Tuesday that “thus far we have not found anything to be able to put out a description.”

I was told that public records requests for the incident report may take “weeks” to be approved. I was also told the Chicago police remain in charge of investigating the alleged incident, while the FBI probe of the alleged hate mail remains separate.

CPD's public information office also told me late Tuesday that when police responded to the 911 call regarding the incident, Smollett gave them no details about where it occurred or what the attackers looked like. None. They were reportedly on scene for an hour with Smollett. When I asked again how the claims about white “MAGA attackers” were disseminated in the press, the PIO replied:

“We have no idea where that came from.”

Minutes after I hung up the phone with her, a local Chicago reporter tweeted that Smollett did mention the “MAGA” angle in a “follow-up, supplemental interview.” Which is it?

Despite all the holes, contradictions and unanswered questions, the MAGA hate crime narrative has already calcified. (Sound familiar?) By 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, a search for “MAGA” and “Smollett” on Google yielded 3,520,000 results. And TMZ ended its day of social justice pot-stirring with the Rev. Al Sharpton calling for President Donald Trump to “denounce Jussie Smollett's MAGA attackers” who have yet to be identified.

Classic manufactured “news”: Report on an uncorroborated hate crime. Plant unverified details. Repeatedly blame white male Trump supporters. Stoke Hollywood outrage. Enlist the godfather of hate crime hoaxes to call on the president to denounce phantom attackers. Reap clicks and publicity. Indict all skeptics as racists and haters. Repeat.

Smears first. Facts later. How much deader can American journalism get?"

Kevin Hart also sent supportive sentiments the Empire star’s way but was called out and criticized with many still angered over homophobic jokes that have recently dogged him into stepping down as host of the Oscars, PEOPLE reports.

Hart was blasted for old homophobic jokes and found himself in the middle of controversy He has apologized several times, and has made several appearances on shows like “Good Morning America” and “Ellen” in which comedian Ellen DeGeneres encouraged him to consider hosting the Oscars. But the internet was far less forgiving and continued to remind him of the jokes, insisting the impact lingered.

TV writer Ira Madison III was among the first to come down on Hart.

This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny — Ira (@ira) January 29, 2019

Another Twitter user echoed him:

Do you see why the “jokes” weren’t funny now?? — Bethany West (@niale_west) January 30, 2019

Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks. Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart. — Saeed Jones (@theferocity) January 29, 2019

“This is your reminder that his jokes reflect actual attitudes that produce what happened to Jussie,” wrote another.

For Black LGBTQ folks processing this news about Jussie:

– it's okay to disengage because you're triggered.

– your fear or anger is justified.

– you don't have to comment online or off.

– you have the right to defend your life.

– take whatever you need as you process. — Dana (@DanaVivianWhite) January 29, 2019

Though they were few, Hart did have his defenders as well.

Stop with the you should not of to Kevin he has apologized more than once and not in the same place anymore. Oh and prayer is always in order. — karen johnson (@kjboojohnson) January 30, 2019

If we were all held accountable and were attacked every day on something we said years ago, it wouldn’t be fair. He’s apologized and moved on. So thanks Kevin for the kind words! This is now. Not then…. Get well @JussieSmollett #movingforward #newday #loveislove — Jabari Thomas (@Jabari_WTSP) January 30, 2019

Agreed. He apologized a couple of times ( actually using the words I apologize) on his podcast Straight from the Hart. Only, some folks will reject and outright lie that he didn’t simply because. Don’t believe the hype. I’m with you, JT. — Danee Riggs (@DaneeRiggs) January 30, 2019

According to Chicago police, Smollett was walking out a Subway eatery in Chicago early Tuesday at around 2 a.m. when someone yelled “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n*****?”

That’s reportedly when two suspects wearing ski masks screamed “This is MAGA country!” A noose was wrapped around Smollett’s neck, and he was beaten to the point that a rib was fractured.

According to That Grape Juice, Fox Studios received hate mail earlier this month targeted to the 36-year-old actor. Cut out letters from magazines spelled out “You will die black f**.”

Empire creator Lee Daniels sounded off about the brutal attack on Instagram.

“You didn’t deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die f–got n–ga’ or whatever they said to you. You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. It starts at home, yo.”

The attack has justly sparked outrage, from community members, to national organizations, and even politicians. However, many are still struggling to understand how this story doesn’t just reside in racism or homophobia but both; Smollett lives in the identity of black and gay simultaneously, and that matters.

The media has been very divided on how to cover this story appropriately, with many failing to discuss it in an intersectional way. Outlets were either okay with using the word “homophobic” but not the word “racist” – opting for “racially charged” instead; or completely ignoring the homophobia and focusing solely on the racism.

It has become very clear that the “MAGA” moniker is nothing more than a hate group. From the kids at Covington High antagonising indigenous people, to the attack on Smollett, the MAGA mob mentality seems to directly mimic President Trump’s rhetoric.

For the most part, calling out racism like this is easy – even when folk frame it with the watered down term “racially charged” meaning they understand the racism involved but deal with it with kid gloves. However, having a productive conversation around homophobia – especially this month, which has been a trying time for black queer men – is still something we haven’t seen enough of.

Throughout January, black queer men have endured Ellen Degeneres speaking on our behalf to absolve Kevin Hart for behaviour she had absolutely no right to excuse, and again when she used the Smollett incident to plug her own show. We have seen the second death of a black gay man in the home of prominent donor to the Democratic Party, Ed Buck – who as of today has yet to be charged with any crime in either of the deaths.

And now, the attack on Smollett – which for many of us in the community is a constant danger and a real fear that we carry around with us daily as we navigate our lives. The important thing in all of this is to look at the the situation in full, and not as if these things are all isolated incidents. Rather, they are connected pieces of the homophobic puzzle that harms people living at the intersection of blackness and queerness.

When we are in white community, it is our race that is seen first. So yes, racism can play a big role in the harm we face as black queer men, but that doesn’t negate the possibility of our queerness also being coming under attack by these very same communities, and that too needs to be recognised.

From transgender military bans to rollbacks on LGBT+ protections and lawsuits like “The Baker Case”, rhetoric from the White House is very much anti-queer. And along with anti-blackness, those ideals trickle down into white community. Although it should be said that that anti-blackness is inherently anti-queer, just the sheer mention of Smollett being a “f****t” lets us know that this targeting was specific, and homophobia played a role in the attack just as much as his race did.

But we also have to acknowledge the nuances of that particular experience. Black queer men have long struggled to navigate our own community when it comes to meaningful conversations about blackness and queerness. During these discussions, if our queerness isn’t denounced, then our need for the latter as well as our race to carry equal weight often is.

And I get why these discussions are so hard. When it comes to Smollett, many feel bringing up the aforementioned struggles in our community is an unfair pivot, considering the attack was done by two white men.

However, for those of us who have been harmed by our own, we don’t get to separate the two into neat categories that rarely intersect; they both inform each other. Next week when we aren’t trending, and when the horrific attack that Smollett endured fades from the top of the news agenda, the same folk who spoke out against the attack will be the same ones who believe it’s right to go back to defending the Kevin Harts of the world. Simply put, this moment of heartwarming “allyship” will be nowhere to be found. We’ve seen it too many times before.

So as much as it may sting to hold our own community accountable in this moment, we must because queer black people like me need you all to get it this time – and I mean really get it. Lives literally depend on the understanding that homophobic jokes are never “just jokes”.

We need you to get that although the attack may have been from white men this time around, on other occasions incidents like these have been and will, sadly, continue to be, from our own. It’s not just from the MAGA cohort (although, believe it or not, there are black Trump supporters too) but from people who proudly claim to believe in the notion that black lives matter, while excluding anyone who isn’t cisgender and heterosexual.

We need to talk about this in totality because I am a black queer man in totality, and I won’t ignore the fullness of my identity for the purpose of “acceptability”.

In this moment, I need folks to understand that homophobia has deadly consequences, just as racism or any other phobia or “ism” that discriminates against marginalised groups. This conversation may be hard, but it’s necessary. For some of us, living at an intersection with danger on both sides is a daily reality."

According to E!, the network decided to delay work on the series, as well as its forthcoming legal drama Proven Innocent, as a result of the extreme weather brought by the polar vortex in Chicago on Wednesday. The Windy City has been hit with below-freezing temperatures, with a windchill warning that temperatures may feel as low as -55 degrees Fahrenheit, as a result of the storm.

Kerry Washington, Zendaya and More Call for Justice in Racist Attack on Jussie Smollett

The timing of the halt on Empire, however, coincides with what has already been an upsetting week for the cast and creatives.

Smollett, who portrays Jamal Lyon on the series, was the victim of a brutal assault late Monday night. According to the Chicago police, the actor was attacked by two men who fractured his rib, poured chemicals on him and tied a noose around his neck while shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Smollett's co-stars as well as other members of the Hollywood community and activists have spoken up to offer support to Smollett as well as demand justice for the assault. Chicago P.D. confirmed that the incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Tuesday, amid reports that Empire star Jussie Smollett was the victim of an apparent hate crime, the veteran singer tweeted what appeared to be a response to the outrage over the incident.

""Are y’all sure you know the facts before we [tear] s*** up?,"" Badu wrote. ""Cause just last week..every head line written about me was all out of context and manipulated to trigger YOUR outrage.""

The blowback regarding Badu's comment followed immediately after, with many Twitter users asking why she tried to make the news about Smollett all about her, or why she would even question the legitimacy of the attack in the first place.

The ""On and On"" singer, however, swiftly offered up an explanation.

""This is not in [reference] to my brother Jussie. This is across the board. Don’t try it, fam,"" she forewarned.

After fans expressed confusion over her saying she wasn't talking about the actor, she attempted to clarify things.

""I was encouraging the group to wait for the FACTS before making a sound judgment on ANYTHING,"" she wrote.

""I used my situation as an example. At the same time I received news our bro Jussie was attacked. I had already started this [conversation] when I was alerted. The two were entangled.""

A week prior to the attack on Jussie Smollett, Fox Studios in Chicago received a threatening and homophobic letter addressed to the actor. While the address and accompanying offensive drawing look like the handiwork of a child, the threat was credible enough for Fox to beef up security on the Empire set.

Smollett, however, declined Fox’s offer for additional security around the clock. A source told TMZ that the actor and singer wanted to maintain a balance between his fame and personal life, and having security off-set would be an intrusive way of living.

Following yesterday’s early-morning attack, Smollett will now have 24-hour security until the two suspects, who have been identified as white men, are caught.

Although Smollett missed shooting Tuesday as a result of the incident, he does plan to return. The shooting schedule will be reconfigured to accommodate him.

Chicago Police are investigating the incident, while the FBI is investigating the threatening letter containing racist and homophobic slurs. Both entities will try to determine whether the letter and attack are related."

Lawmakers and others also weighed in: The New York Post reports that Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris called the attack ""an attempted modern day lynching,"" and Rev. Al Sharpton went on TMZ to call on President Trump to denounce the attack (the attackers reportedly yelled, ""This is MAGA country""). TMZ also reports Smollett, who received a threatening letter at Fox Studios in Chicago a week before the attack, had declined the studio's offer of extra security just days before the attack.

Chicago — Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early-morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday. Investigators ""for the most part"" can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said. Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the crime scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Mollett's description of the suspects. ""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that was thrown at the actor.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the ""thin rope"" around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Mollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglelmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.""

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett, personally. She called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the most famous examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

Henson is speaking out in the wake of the racist and homophobic attack on her Empire co-star Jussie Smollett.

Henson, who portrays Smollett’s on-screen mother, Cookie, on the popular FOX drama, took to Instagram on Wednesday to break her silence on the Tuesday morning attack in Chicago, which left Smollett with lacerations to his face and neck the Chicago Police Department investigating “a possible hate crime.”

“I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now,"" Henson wrote, sharing a black-and-white video of Smollett performing his song “F.U.W.” ""[Jussie Smollett] is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.""

""This song needs to be downloaded until it goes triple platinum because the message is NEEDED,"" she continued of Smollett's political track. ""#weareresilientpeople AND #weaintgoingnowhereuntillwearefinished. The love so many have him just goes to show HE IS LOVE!!!! I LOVE YOU MY BABY MY BABY!!! #LOVEWINSALWAYS.""

Henson’s message of support followed a similar sentiment issued by Smollet’s on-screen father, Terrence Howard, who broke his silence on the attack during an appearance on Good Morning America Wednesday.

“I heard he’s getting better,"" Howard said of Smollett. ""He’s angry, but I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate, and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

“Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood,” he continued. “He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family — you know, the Fox family, the Empire family, the Lyon family — were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.”

The Tuesday attack, which occurred as Smollett was leaving a Subway restaurant at around 2 a.m., came eight days after Fox Studios had received an anonymous letter threatening the actor’s life. The letter, featuring words spelled with letters cut out from magazines, read “You will die black f—.”

In response to the attack, Empire has reportedly upped security, including armed security, as the cast continues production in Chicago.

Smollett was released from a local hospital shortly after the attack and is said to be “physically O.K.” He has not yet spoken out regarding the incident."

The world was stunned to hear news reports of Jussie Smollett being attacked in Chicago. The attack featured homophobic and racist slurs directed at him from two unknown assailants who also yelled “MAGA country” at him. Th entertainment world has come out in support of Jussie.

One such celebrity was Kevin Hart who put the above message out in support of him. However, his message didn’t go over well because he’s spent the better part of 2019 going back and forth on apologizing for his jokes and tweets that are definitely anti-gay. Twitter has not forgotten and have lashed out at Hart’s message.

According to The Blast, who published the photo, it was shared by Empire co-creator Lee Daniels, and depicts Smollett laying in a hospital bed with a cut underneath his right eye.

Until now, the public has not seen the extent of how the attack left Smollett, and thankfully his injuries are not worse.

The actor was violently attacked while in Chicago this week, telling police that men in masks beat him, poured bleach on him, and then left him with a noose tied around his neck.

Daniels initially spoke out against the crime — which is suspected to have been fueled by the fact that Smollett is a gay black man — saying, “Nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck … to have bleach thrown on you,"" and then adding, ""You are better than that … we are better than that … America is better than that.”

20th Century Fox, the network that produces and airs Empire, also provided a statement on the alleged hate crime.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,"" the statement read. ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.”

Smollett's co-star Terrence Howard has also commented on the attack, telling Good Morning America that Smollett is obviously upset, but that he believes his on-screen son is incredibly resilient.

“I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,” Howard said. “But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

“Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood,” Howard went on to say. “He’s the one that cheers everybody up.

Smollett does not appear to have publicly commented on the attack at this time."

The Upside actor posted messages on Instagram and Twitter on Tuesday decrying the attack Smollett claimed to have suffered.

“Sending prayers your way. This is unbelievably sad,” Hart wrote to Smollett.

Alongside a photo of Smollett, Kevin Hart continued on Instagram saying, “Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

But the outrage mob was not having any of Hart’s “choosing love.” Social media users went on the attack recalling some of Hart’s past jokes that some called “homophobic.”

TV writer Ira Madison III, for instance, quickly slammed Hart saying, “This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny.”

Kevin Hart is receiving some criticism for comments he made regarding the possible hate crime against Empire star Jussie Smollett.

On Tuesday, Jan. 29, 2019, Hart took to Instagram to react to news that Smollett had reportedly been attacked by two men the day before. ""Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett,"" Hart wrote. ""This is unbelievably sad."" The actor-producer then addressed the disturbing nature of the incident: ""Why are we going backwards....this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate????""

The father of three ended his message with a plea to fans, stating, ""Choose love...I repeat...Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.""

Given the circumstances surrounding the attack against Smollett, who was reportedly called homophobic and racist slurs during the horrific incident, some fans weren't thrilled that Hart, who has infamously made homophobic jokes in the past, offered up his support. ""Oh now you want to pretend like you care?"" one social media user tweeted. ""Lolololol this is rich.""

TV writer Ira Madison seemingly took aim at Hart as well, writing on Twitter, ""This is why someone's jokes about beating their gay son were never funny."" Sally Field's son, Sam Greisman, tweeted out, ""But keep joking about beating up your kid for being gay, Kevin Hart!""

Hart seemingly addressed the backlash on Wednesday, Jan. 30. On Twitter, he posted, ""Operation spread love is in full effect,"" adding, ""I don't condone or believe in hate, [in fact] I despise it."" He went on, ""Hate makes me sick to my stomach...Its pointless. Cowards & weak individuals embrace it. I choose love...I love all of you. I challenge the rest of the world 2 do the same.""

As TMZ previously reported, Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two white men in ski masks during the early hours of Tuesday, Jan. 29. Insiders told TMZ that the perps beat him, pouring bleach on him and placing a noose around his neck. Upon leaving the scene, the assailants reportedly said, ""This is MAGA country.""

Despite reportedly suffering a fractured rib during the attack, Smollett was said to be in ""good condition,"" according to a statement from the Chicago police that was obtained by HuffPost editor Philip Lewis."

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the FBI is looking into the alleged threatening letter. In photos of the alleged letter obtained by GrapeJuice.net and TMZ, the words “you will die black f–” are spelled out in magazine letter cut-outs.

PEOPLE has reached out to the FBI for comment. The agency declined to comment to the Sun-Times.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed in a statement Tuesday that a member of the hit Fox show was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery.”

According to Chicago PD, a “36-year-old man was walking … when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him. The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

The statement added that the victim was treated at Northwestern Hospital and is in “good condition.”

Smollett told police his assailants yelled racially charged and homophobic slurs and President Donald Trump‘s slogan, “MAGA.”

In a statement to PEOPLE, Chicago Police confirmed that the victim — who has not been officially identified as Smollett — remembered his attackers calling out the “Make America Great Again” acronym.

“In the initial reports there was no mention of MAGA,” the statement read. “When detectives [followed] up with him later in the day, he recalled the offenders making those comments and detectives completed a supplemental report.”

Police added that “detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators.”"

“I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now. @jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!!” she wrote Wednesday. “I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!!

The actress continued: “The love so many have him just goes to show HE IS LOVE!!!! I LOVE YOU MY BABY MY BABY!!!”

Along with the heartfelt message, Henson posted Smollett’s political protest anthem “F.U.W.”

On Wednesday, Terrence Howard appeared on Good Morning America, where he spoke out for the first time about what happened to Smollett, who portrays his son on the series.

“I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,” Howard said. “But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

Empire creator Lee Daniels also addressed the incident on social media.

In a video posted to Instagram, the 59-year-old director began, “It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because, Jussie, you are my son.”

“You didn’t deserve — nor does anybody deserve — to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called, ‘Die, f—t n—r’ or whatever they said to you,” a visibly emotional Daniels continued.

“You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that,” he added. “It starts at home … We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows that we are … [a] united front.”

At around 2 a.m. local time in Chicago on Tuesday, the Smollett went to the hospital after he was the victim of an apparent hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed in a statement that a member of the hit Fox show was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery,” though they did not name Smollett.

CHICAGO -- Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the ""persons of interest"" Wednesday evening.

Investigators ""for the most part"" can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor ""is at home and recovering.""

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.""

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

More details have been uncovered about the brutal attack on Jussie Smollett in Chicago early Tuesday morning.

Early reports of the hate crime indicated two men physically assaulted the Empire actor, pouring a substance believed to be bleach on him while yelling, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett was hospitalized and later discharged. Chicago PD is currently investigating the incident, and shared new details about the night of the attack.

But first we have a positive update on how the actor is doing following the attack.

A source close the 35-year-old tells ET some comforting news; Jussie is going to be OK:

“Jussie is surrounded by family and friends and is thankful to be alive. Jussie is a fighter and will come out of this stronger.”

We can’t even imagine. Our heart goes out to the actor as the search continues for his assailants.

Initial reports stated that the actor took himself to the hospital after the attack. But according to ET, Smollett was actually taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital by his manager. A police spokesperson also told the outlet Jussie still had the noose tied around his neck when he made contact with law enforcement that morning at 2:42am.

Awful. Just awful.

The spokesperson said police are “utilizing resources to investigate [this case] thoroughly.” This includes using surveillance footage from the Subway restaurant that Jussie visited before the attack, and looking through city and privately owned footage recorded in the area too.

We’ll keep you updated with more details as they come.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

*Presidential candidate and Democratic Calif. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris has added her voice to the chorus of celebrities who are condemning the racially-charged homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett in Chicago.

“This was an attempted modern-day lynching,” Harris tweeted. “No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

As we previously reported, the “Empire” star was allegedly attacked by 2 masked assailants who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor. The suspects reportedly doused Smollett with bleach and tied a noose around his neck during the vicious assault.

Smollett reportedly transported himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and was released early Tuesday afternoon in “good condition” hours later.

Chicago investigators are now searching for surveillance footage that may show the brutal attack. The Blast reportedly obtained dispatch audio of officials “canvassing” the area for cameras near Smollett’s apartment building in the city, where he films the hit FOX music drama “Empire.”

As reported by SandraRose, sources tell WENN.com the suspects recognized Smollett from his role as gay singer/songwriter Jamal Lyon on the series and shouted, “Aren’t you that f**got Empire n**ger?”

A number of celebrities have taken to social media to voice their support for Smollett, including Empire creator Lee Daniels, who recorded a video on Instagram in which the said: “You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck. You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.”

In a statement, 20th Century Fox also expressed support for one of their star talents.

“We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,” the statement said. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

On Monday night, Smollett was the victim of an alleged racist and homophobic attack in Chicago. Two men allegedly verbally and physically attacked the “Empire” star, 35, then doused him with a chemical substance. The incident is under investigation by the Chicago Police Department.

On Tuesday, Hart sent his prayers to Smollett. “This is unbelievably sad,” Hart said. “Why are we going backward… this is disgusting. WTF is going on [in] the world??? Why are we falling in love with hate??? God damn it people. Choose love. I repeat. Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

Hart also shared that he’s challenging the world to choose love because “Hate makes me sick to my stomach. It’s pointless.”

The comedian was chosen to host the 2019 Oscars before old homophobic tweets resurfaced. Hart claimed numerous times that he had apologized for his comments and that his viewpoint has evolved. He ultimately apologized once more in early January, saying, “Once again, Kevin Hart apologizes for his remarks that hurt members of the LGBTQ community. I apologize.”

Smollett’s “Empire” castmates shared their thoughts and feelings about the attack. Taraji P. Henson shared a clip from his music video, “FUW” (F—ked Up World), adding, “The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.”

The 35-year-old Jussie Smollett was attacked at 2am on Tuesday in Chicago by two men in ski masks. He is pictured talking on FaceTime with Lee Daniels, creator of Empire

The 35-year-old, who came out as gay on The Ellen Show in 2015, was set upon by two men in ski masks at 2am on Tuesday in Chicago.

A photo of Smollett, which showed him still in his hospital bed, revealed the actor's bruised and swollen face. The picture, taken from a FaceTime conversation between Smollett and 'Empire' creator Lee Daniels, also showed a cut under his right eye.

The FBI is now investigating the case as a racially-charged battery and assault. They are looking at nearby businesses for possible surveillance video.

Smollett lives in Chicago, where Empire films, while the show is in production.

Police reports stated that Smollett was walking from a local Subway sandwich shop when the two men started yelling homophobic and racial slurs, including: 'Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?'

The two then started beating on the actor while pouring bleach on him.

A noose was then tied around his neck, and Smollett was still wearing it a 2:42am when police arrived on the scene.

The Chicago Police Department also confirmed to DailyMail.com that Smollett informed them the men were screaming 'this is MAGA country' during the attack.

Smollett was admitted to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital but has since been released. He suffered a fractured rib during the attack, and is said to have put up a fight when he was beaten.

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, date stamped from January 18, reading: 'You will die black f*g.'

People had a lot to say about Ellen's response to the brutal attack, calling out the hypocrisy of minimizing Hart's violent words from 10 years ago about how he would react if his child were to be gay, which he has said was a joke.

DeGeneres had Hart on her show during the first week of January, and told him on air that she contacted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in an effort to get him re-hired as host of the upcoming Oscars.

This was after Hart opted to step down from hosting the Oscar's after homophobic tweets from 2009-2011 resurfaced.

In 2011, he wrote in a since-deleted tweet: 'Yo if my son comes home & try's 2 play with my daughters doll house I'm going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice ''stop that's gay.'' '

Hart had refused to apologize for a 2011 tweet in which he said he would tell his son it was gay to play with a doll house

Even though it was deleted, screen captures began circulating online, gaining widespread criticism.

Less than two hours after posting anInstagram video refusing to apologize, Hart changed his tune, issuing an apology to the LGBTQ community along with his resignation as Oscars host.

'I'm sorry that I hurt people. I am evolving and want to continue to do so. My goal is to bring people together not tear us apart. Much love & appreciation to the Academy. I hope we can meet again,' Hart tweeted on December 6.

On Wednesday, in response to DeGeneres's tweet about the Smollett attack, Buzzfeed's AM2DM co-host Saeed Jones called all of this back up.

'And less than four weeks ago, you sat across from Kevin Hart and said ""Don't let those people win."" But ""those people"" whom you described as ""haters"" were queer black people hoping that you’d take the relationship between language and violence more seriously,' Jones wrote.

The comedian announced he would step down and then apologized to the LGBTQ community for his 'insensitive words'

His apology came too late, however, since he had already rejected the Academy's ultimatum to apologize or be replaced

Hart had posted on December 4 about how hosting the Oscars was a lifelong goal of his

DeGeneres had Kevin Hart on her show during the first week of January, and told him on air that she contacted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in an effort to get him re-hired as host of the upcoming Oscars. Hart (left) and DeGeneres (right) are pictured on the show in January where the exchange occurred

People had a lot to say about Ellen's response to the brutal attack, calling out the hypocrisy of minimizing Hart's violent words from 10 years ago about how he would react if his child were to be gay, which he has said was a joke

Her timing was also criticized.

'As the self-proclaimed, singular voice of the entire queer community, you waited a long time to post this. Also, you JUST used your platform to defend casual homophobia. This tweet is so empty and that’s how I know your publicist didn't write it,' Twitter user @a_frances34 wrote, identified with the name 'Black Woman'.

User @reedjasonf listed as Jason Reed replied, 'Wut? How did this tweet defend homophobia? And how was what happened to Smollett ""casual""? Biting at Ellen is putting your anger in the wrong direction #friendlyfire.'

'Black woman' fired right back, writing, 'Jason, you are clearly unaware that Ellen recently allotted a significant portion of her show to the Kevin Hart Not-Actually-An-Apology-For-Blatant-Homophobia Tour, and that she personally absolved him of his attacks on the black queer community. So, please spare me the lecture.

'She was wrong and you are wrong. #IgnorantFire'

Many discussions ensued in DeGeneres' mentions as people grappled with their hurt, and lack of understanding of the broader implications of DeGeneres' and Hart's actions, or lack thereof

Members of LGBTQ+ community did not hold back in pointing Hart had not yet spoken on the sickening attack, by the time DeGeneres has made her delayed comment.

Twitter user Kenny Sullivan, with username @kennysullivanm wrote, 'Where’s @KevinHart4real at tho sis? This LGBTQ ally you propping up for us. We’re waiting.'

There were some who stood by DeGeneres, though, as she was being critiqued en masse for being too dismissive of the greater impact of Hart's nonchalance at joking about punishing homosexuality with violence.

One Twitter user under the handle @curlsmcgee7 wrote: '.....LOL remember when Kevin Hart said he'd physically punish his son for being gay then you normalized that mindset by having him on your show?'

To that, 'Nikky' with username '@briteye2000' replied: 'I think I’ll remember when Jussie came out on her show because of her bravery and because she has done so much for the gay community and gay rights.

User‏ @curlsmcgee7 replied to 'Nikky' then, wite: 'And I choose to remember/was a witness to the hate and vitriol that she experienced when she used a national platform to help rather than hinder the LGTBQ community by risking it all and coming out on her hugely successful show.

'Maybe something better would have been ""it was a privilege to have personally witnessed Jussie coming out 4 years ago, I’m sorry I ended up redeeming a man that promoted the very language that resulted in Jussie’s assault. I failed him, and especially the black lgbtq community.""'

According to the report, sources indicate that security for the cast was increased after Fox Studios received a threatening, homophobic letter that was sent to Smollett.

Smollett reportedly did not want want to be hindered by an entourage of bodyguards during production for the hit TV series. The network wanted to increase security for everyone on the set and offered Jussie Smollett some additional protection around the clock. However, he declined the offer because he did not want to have additional security during his off-hours.

As previously noted, two caucasian males wearing ski masks reportedly attacked Jussie Smollett, put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him. As they left him, they reportedly screamed, “MAGA country.”

Smollett reportedly missed shooting on Tuesday of this week to recover from injuries he sustained during the attack. He reportedly plans to return to work soon, and the show is slated to move forward as planned. However, the shooting schedule is being altered to accommodate his recovery.

Police in Chicago are still investigating the crime. Additionally, the FBI is investigating the threatening letter that was sent to the production. The authorities are reportedly trying to determine if there’s a connection between the letter and the attack on Smollett."

Tyrese Gibson has complained about ex-wife Norma in court, claiming she violated the custody agreement over their daughter, Shayla.

The Fast And Furious actor reportedly told the court she had left the 11-year-old with a classmate during a sleepover, in order to go on holiday to Trinidad on the final day of her custody.

In legal documents, the 40-year-old explained she is obligated to notify him of any change of plans, and give him the opportunity to watch her.

TMZ states he claimed he was told after the sleepover took place, which violates their agreement.

Tyrese reportedly also complained Norma posted photos of Shayla to her social media page two years ago – pictures he only recently found – breaking another term in their contract.

A judge has now granted the Transformers star’s request, meaning Norma has been summoned to appear in court and give her side of the story.

If she doesn’t show, she could be held in contempt of court and be forced to pay her ex’s legal bills.

Tyrese’s court claims come just three months after he became a dad for the second time, welcoming a daughter with wife Samantha.

Henson has said “hate will not win” after her Empire co-star Jussie Smollett was attacked in what police suspect was a hate crime.

The 35-year-old actor, who is black and came out as gay in 2015, was approached by two men in downtown Chicago at about 2am on Tuesday, police said.

He was struck in the face before having an “unknown chemical substance” poured over him and a rope wrapped around his neck, according to investigators.

The suspects shouted racial and homophobic slurs during the attack, police said. No arrests have been made.

The Hollywood star, who plays Smollett’s mother on the TV show, shared a clip from one of his music videos on Instagram and wrote: “I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now.

“@jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!!

“I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him.

“The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.”

Police also confirmed Smollett told them his attackers made reference to MAGA – Make America Great Again – which was Donald Trump’s slogan during the 2016 US presidential campaign.

Smollett has starred in Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terence Howard.

Howard told Good Morning America: “Our jaws dropped to the ground and when we learned that there had been letters that had been sent to Fox as threats about the potential of something like this, then we became much more frightened.”

He added: “He’s angry, but I known Jussie, his anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t – we cannot – forget their actions.

Michael B Jordan wrote on Instagram: “Stand with my brother @jussiesmollett sending you light and love. Be strong We got you.”

Queer Eye host Jonathan Van Ness said “queer people are attacked every single day”, adding: “We have not come as far as we think.”

Kevin Hart, who stepped down from his role as Oscars host after historical homophobic tweets surfaced, also sent Smollett a message of support.

He wrote on Instagram: “Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better.”

US president Trump is yet to comment, despite pressure to do so.

Earlier, Empire creator Lee Daniels reacted to the attack and said “America is better than that”.

In an emotional video to Instagram, Daniels called Smollett his “son”, before calling for change.

He said: “It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.”

As well as his acting, Smollett is also a singer and activist who has advocated HIV/Aids prevention."

The violence of the story is troubling on its own. Add to it Smollett’s identity as a gay black man, and details that his attackers were reported to have shouted racist and homophobic slurs, and the pro-Trump “MAGA” slogan, and you have a heart-grippingly clear example of why so many members of protected classes have come to feel unsafe during a moment in which hatred and rage have come to so thoroughly dominate our national discourse.

Adding to the sense of horror, though, is Smollett’s status as among America’s most prominent LGBTQ entertainers, and one whose weekly presence on the airwaves makes him a special kind of star. Since “Empire’s” debut in 2015, Smollett has been bringing to life the story of Jamal Lyon, a man whose identities — as gay and as black — doubly inform who he is, a person who’s both coming to terms with himself and struggling to find a way to exist with pride and confidence in a society that often presents real challenges. “Empire,” still a ratings force, and in its earliest days a phenomenon, reaches enough people to have a genuine culture-shifting effect. Smollett, telling a story of a man who lives at an intersection of identities and embraces every part of himself, is telling a story that’s too infrequently told, on the largest scale imaginable.

“Empire,” as a show, is built with a bit of something for everyone; it’s a crowd-pleasing soap with a kitchen-sink approach to plot. And yet Smollett’s performance never allows the issues his character raises to feel schematic. As a performer, he’s unusually charismatic and yet also evidently thoughtful in a way that manifests itself in a sort of low-key warmth. He stands up for his own dignity against, for instance, his father without cant or rage that would be merited — he simply continues to prove his own worthiness, to shine. He doesn’t steal scenes so much as illuminate them, quietly and without the showy brazenness that comes to mind when one first thinks of “Empire.” He’s the show’s human factor.

As a star of a popular series, Smollett allows his gifts to be put toward stories badly worth telling, from the show’s early days — when his character coped with, and pushed past, his father’s homophobic hatred — to just this season, when Smollett pushed for and starred in a storyline about Jamal dating a man with HIV, a plot meant to reduce stigma around the disease. “Empire,” it can be easy to forget, still drives major viewership and conversation; it’s just that that viewership and conversation, in large part, has fallen out of press coverage. It’s likely that Smollett’s black fans who are not gay and his gay fans who are not black have learned a great deal not merely from his real-life activism but also from, over five seasons, his ability to convey pride in all of himself, his refusal to segment his identity.

Details about the alleged attack on Smollett are still coming out. The actor has yet to speak publicly about the incident. But the violence directed at him seems intended as an attack on the work he’s done and on who he is — that same bold, intersectional, unashamed self that “Empire” lifts up and celebrates. That Smollett will have behind him, as he heals, a vast community of support from different corners of America is a tribute to the performer he is — ever unapologetically himself — and the ways in which he’s sought to show viewers exactly what the black gay experience is like. And that he’s been the victim of a hate crime, one that seems to have been committed by people who knew and deplored his work, is a sign of just how necessary it is that the entertainment industry make room for even more Jussie Smolletts — more queer artists of color given places in the mainstream so that they can speak clearly, passionately, and with unfakeable humanity about their own experiences, to fight hatred with excellence."

Hours earlier, Chicago police told Fox News that they've reviewed hundreds of hours of footage from downtown surveillance cameras but haven't found footage yet of the alleged attack.

The department said Wednesday afternoon that they are expanding their search to the Chicago River area after footage from privately-owned cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked did not prove fruitful. Police are also broadening their search by reviewing footage from traffic cameras and public bus cameras.

""We are taking this investigation very seriously,"" the police statement said.

Smollett told police he was walking downtown near the Chicago River at around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an ""unknown substance"" on him and put a rope around his neck. Police also told Fox News that Smollett said the attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country.” Investigators said he gave the detail to detectives during a follow-up inquiry, not when he initially reported the incident to police.

A rep for Smollett did not return Fox News' request for comment. Police said Smollett took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after the alleged attack for treatment.

In a statement to Fox News, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Smollett plays openly gay musician Jamal Lyon on the Fox series. The actor told Ellen DeGeneres in 2015 that he identifies as gay but does not discuss his personal life in public.

Chicago police announced Tuesday evening that they have examined hundreds of hours of surveillance footage in an attempt to corroborate actor Jussie Smollett’s claim that he was attacked by a group of Trump-supporting bigots this week, but have been unable to surface any footage of the crime.

After reviewing private surveillance footage captured by businesses in the area, police remain unable to substantiate Smollett’s claim that he was beaten and subjected to racist and homophobic taunts outside of a Subway restaurant early Tuesday morning. They now plan to expand the search by reviewing footage captured on traffic and public-bus cameras.

Smollett, who stars in the hit show Empire, told police that the two assailants put a noose around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him before yelling, “This is MAGA country” as they fled. When police arrived at his apartment after the attack, Smollett still had a a “thin, light rope” around his neck and police recommended he go to a local hospital to be treated for facial lacerations.

The actor, who is black and gay, initially excluded the Trump-related detail when he spoke to police, but after TMZ included the detail in a report on the incident, the police contacted Smollett and he confirmed it.

A number of high-profile Democrats have cited the incident as an instance of political violence and suggested it reflects a rise in racial hatred across the country.

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching.

What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country.

Smollett, 36, has repeatedly disparaged Trump and his supporters as racists and advocated on behalf of liberal political causes on his personal social-media accounts.

Kevin Hart is getting a backlash after sending a message of support to gay actor Jussie Smollett after a homophobic attack.

The comedian, who recently came under fire for his history of anti-gay jokes and tweets, posted a message of support to social media on Tuesday (January 29) after Empire star Jussie Smollett was the reported victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

Kevin Hart wrote: “Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting.

“We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love.

“I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

Kevin Hart message did not go down well on Twitter

The post did not go down well on social media, where people pointed to Kevin Hart’s own recent response when called out for homophobia.

Kevin Hart dropped out as the host of the Oscars ceremony on December 6, after he was reportedly asked by the Academy to issue an apology for a number of resurfaced homophobic tweets.

The comedian, who had sent tweets mocking “fags” and included anti-gay jokes in his comedy as recently as 2010, chose to pull out as host rather than apologise.

One response to Kevin Hart’s post says: “Hopefully you now see that the ‘jokes’ you peddled, that incited violence against #LGBT people were never – ever – funny.”

Another added: “What’s going on in the world is that a group of men thought it was ok to beat and abuse a man because of his sexuality and race. Wonder where they could have got an idea like that?”

Hart has since posted a cryptic response to the call-outs, explaining he would “spread love.”

He tweeted: “Operation spread love is in full effect damn it. I don’t condone or believe in hate, infact I despise it.

“Hate makes me sick to my stomach…Its pointless. Cowards & weak individuals embrace it. I choose love…I love all of you. I challenge the rest of the world 2 do the same.”

Empire co-stars send support after Jussie Smollett attack

Smollett is yet to speak publicly about the incident, but many of his Empire colleagues have sent messages of support.

In an emotional video posted to Instagram, Empire co-creator Lee Daniels said: “It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because, Jussie, you are my son.

“You didn’t deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘faggot n****r’ or whatever they said to you.

“You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home.”

Daniels added: “We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows we are united on a united front and no racist f**k can come in and do the things that they did to you.

“Hold your head up, Jussie. I’m with you. I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another f***ing day in America.”

A statement on behalf of the entire Empire production adds: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night.

“We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

“The entire studio, network and production shared united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate, and especially against one of our own.”"

“Extra” caught up with Scaramucci, who opened up about his time on the reality show, his view on “Empire"" star Jussie Smollett's attack, and his current relationship with the White House.

Breaking some news, Scaramucci said, “I’m having dinner with General Kelly this week… This is the guy that fired me. My first conversation with him was three minutes long — he was doing all the talking, I was doing all the packing… For me, I want to put that behind us and bury the hatchet, so I reached out to him and asked him to go to dinner, so we will be having dinner this week and he’s gonna be the keynote speaker at my conference in May in Las Vegas.”

“I was so sore about being fired like that, but he is an American patriot. I love the country, he loves country, let’s shake hands and move on,” he continued.

What does Scaramucci want to talk about with the General? He shared, “We are both committed to ways finding ways to make the country better. There is a whole host of things we could potentially work on together.”

Many in the country are rallying behind “Empire” star Jussie Smollett after he was attacked in what is being called a hate crime. Anthony weighed in, saying, “I think that sort of behavior is disgusting.”

Smollett reported to police that his attackers used the phrase ""MAGA country,"" referencing President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Of this, Scaramucci noted, “There's a bunch of perhaps racist idiots that are going to use the red hat.""

“It's a terrible thing that the hat has ridiculously turned into this totem for racism or totem for intolerance,” he emphasized. “I would like to see the White House come out and make some... statements and denounce this sort of behavior and separating the President’s message and agenda from that sort of intolerance.""

While he doesn’t work in the White House, Anthony is still in contact with President Trump. He said, ""Last time I talked to him was on Christmas Eve.""

As for reports that the Mueller investigation is coming to a close, Scaramucci smiled, saying, ""I’m not getting indicted.""

He also does not think it is likely the President will be ousted from office, explaining, “My gut tells me that the President is not directly involved... based on my campaign and transition experience.”

Anthony dished on his experience on “Celebrity Big Brother” after it was revealed he was never a houseguest at all but a twist in the game! He commented, “It was four episodes. I was in the house for six days — 144 hours to be exact. I’ve got everything down to seconds and hours after my White House experience. I was there for 954,000 seconds... It was great.""

Another interesting tidbit: The 55-year-old had never seen the show before! He said, ""I held my own and I think I got them pretty good.""

His only negative experience might have been weight gain! ""I think I gained the freshman 15 in five days,"" he admitted. ""They don’t call me the Mooch for no reason!”

Anthony played coy about a possible return to the show before season's end, dishing, ""You should always expect the unexpected… If anything was gonna happen, I can’t say anything."""

Production on Empire was temporarily suspended on Jan. 30 by 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment.

The shutdown of the Chicago-based series was not immediately related to the alleged attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

According to E! News, production of both Empire and the legal drama Proven Innocent, has been temporarily halted due to the arctic temperatures in Chicago.

According to the report, the offenders “battered” Smollett with their hands “about the face” before allegedly pouring “an unknown chemical substance on the victim.”

The report also notes that during the attack, “one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

According to police, the offenders fled the scene, and the victim was self-transported to Northwestern Hospital.

Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of footage from downtown surveillance cameras but haven’t found footage yet of the alleged attack on Smollett.

The department said in a news release late Tuesday that detectives reviewed footage from privately-owned cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked and will broaden their search by reviewing footage from traffic cameras and public bus cameras.

Smollett told police he was walking downtown near the Chicago River at around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an “unknown substance” on him and put a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

Terrence Howard has broken his silence on Empire co-star Jussie Smollett’s horrific ‘hate crime’.

The 49-year-old Oscar nominee appeared on Good Morning America on Wednesday to address the brutal attack, which saw the actor hospitalised as a result of his injuries.

‘I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,’ Howard told the GMA hosts.

‘But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.’

‘He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping.

‘No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family – you know, the Fox family, the Empire family, the Lyon family – were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.’

Jussie, who plays Howard’s son in the series, was ‘brutally attacked’ by two men wearing ski masks at around 2am on Tuesday morning in an incident police are investigating as a ‘possible hate crime’.

The 35-year-old actor had arrived in the city late on Monday and headed to Subway for food at around 2am, when he was approached by the men.

It’s been claimed they asked him: ‘Aren’t you that f****t Empire n*****?’ before beating him, ‘putting a rope around his neck and pouring bleach on him’.

It’s thought Jussie still had a rope around his neck when he made contact with Chicago PD and in a follow up interview he said they yelled ‘MAGA country’ as they walked away.

MAGA stands for Make America Great Again, President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan and which is now used as a not-so-subtle code by white supremacists and racists.

Temperatures are set to remain below freezing this week, and the city is currently at -26 degrees celsius.

The move comes one day after 35-year-old Empire star Jussie was brutally attacked shortly after arriving in Chicago from New York for filming.

The actor, who plays Jamal Lyon in the drama series, was walking back from Subway in the early hours of the morning when two unknown assailants yelled both homophobic and racial slurs at him before beating him up while shouting: ""This is a MAGA [Make America Great Again] country.""

At one point, a rope was tied around Jussie's neck and an unknown substance - reported to be bleach - was poured onto his skin.

He was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, but has since been released while Chicago PD are investigating the incident as battery.

Chicago PD told TMZ: ""[We] received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday asking for a hate crimes investigation into the attack on actor Jussie Smollett.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was assaulted in Chicago early Tuesday in what police have called a “possible racially charged assault and battery.”

“This is a hate crime plain and simple and I will not stand by while evil acts are inflicted on any citizen, especially not in my hometown,” Rush said in the letter.

Rush said he was “disturbed” by reports that the two attackers allegedly wrapped a noose around Smollett’s neck, an act Rush described as an “attempted lynching” that “harkens back to some of the darkest days in our history.”

Last year, Rush introduced legislation that would make lynching a federal crime. The measure was co-sponsored by nearly three-dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus. At the time, Rush said the legislation was necessary given the resurgence of white nationalism as evidenced by recent events such as the 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

“While many may argue that lynching has been relegated to history, you only need to look at the events in Charlottesville last year to be reminded that the racist and hateful sentiments that spurred these abhorrent crimes are still prevalent in today’s American society,” he said at the time.

On Wednesday, Rush renewed his call for Congress to take up his legislation, which he said would “ensure perpetrators receive an enhanced sentence under hate crimes statutes.”

Smollett, 35, was walking on a Chicago street about 2 a.m. local time Tuesday “when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department said in a statement.

“The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” the statement said. “At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

Smollett told detectives his attackers said “something to the effect of ‘this is MAGA country,’ ” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, during the assault.

He was struck in the face before having an “unknown chemical substance” poured over him and a rope wrapped around his neck, according to investigators.

The suspects shouted racial and homophobic slurs during the attack, police said. No arrests have been made.

The Hollywood star, who plays Smollett’s mother on the TV show, shared a clip from one of his music videos on Instagram and wrote: “I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now.

“@jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!!

“I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him.

“The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.”

Howard told Good Morning America: “Our jaws dropped to the ground and when we learned that there had been letters that had been sent to Fox as threats about the potential of something like this, then we became much more frightened.”

Temperatures are set to remain below freezing this week, and the city is currently at -26 degrees celsius.

The move comes one day after 35-year-old Empire star Jussie was brutally attacked shortly after arriving in Chicago from New York for filming.

The actor, who plays Jamal Lyon in the drama series, was walking back from Subway in the early hours of the morning when two unknown assailants yelled both homophobic and racial slurs at him before beating him up while shouting: ""This is a MAGA [Make America Great Again] country.""

At one point, a rope was tied around Jussie's neck and an unknown substance - reported to be bleach - was poured onto his skin.

He was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, but has since been released while Chicago PD are investigating the incident as battery.

Chicago PD told TMZ: ""[We] received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Since they’ve “reviewed hundreds of hours of video” that only shows Smollett standing alone, authorities are now widening their geographical search for additional surveillance, as they have yet to encounter any helpful information.

Additionally, CNN’s Sara Sidner explains, “So far, in a place so far with a high number of private surveillance cameras, they cannot find any images of the two alleged attackers. After combing through hundreds of hours of videos, the only image of Smollett police obtained from security cameras was inside the Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime — and he was standing alone.”

Furthermore, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says:

Chicago police detectives continue to investigate serious allegations of a potential racially charged hate crime that took place in the downtown area Tuesday morning around 2 a.m. The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras. As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders. Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect’s vehicle to be able to share.

Guglielmi adds:

We are taking this investigation very seriously and detective teams will broaden our search area and work around the clock to look for video on traffic cameras, CTA buses and neighboring thoroughfares which could have captured the offender’s movements. The victim in this case is cooperating fully with detectives and our investigation continues.

Mccrone', 'Vince Lattanzio']",https://media.nbcboston.com/images/1200*675/Johnny+Doc+Bobby+Henon.jpg?ak=bc,"['dougherty', 'funds', 'local', 'union', 'embezzled', '98', 'philly', 'charges', 'ibew', 'city', 'federal', 'prosecutors', 'leader', 'johnny', 'henon', 'philadelphia', 'powerful', 'doc']","What to Know Federal officials announced 116 corruption counts against Philadelphia IBEW 98 Local union leader John J. “Johnny Doc” Dougherty.

The 160-page indictment alleges that Dougherty and his co-defendants conspired to embezzle union money for their own use.

The embezzlement charges stem from falsified financial records from 2010 to 2016.

Baby wipes, Q-Tips, bottled water and expensive dinners were all part of an elaborate embezzlement scheme by powerful electricians' union leader John ""Johnny Doc"" Dougherty and Philadelphia Councilman Bobby Henon, according to a federal charging document unsealed Wednesday morning.

Dougherty, whose brother sits on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, exerted complete control over the union, according to the 116-count indictment, using that power to ""repeatedly and persistently steal its funds and put his own self-interests over that of the membership.""

He also helped propel Henon, a Local 98 staffer, into a powerful leadership position on the Philadelphia City Council to apply pressure to other trade groups and businesses, prosecutors allege.

“I don’t give a f--- about anybody, all right, but f---ing you and us, and you know that,"" Henon told Dougherty in 2015 when reassuring him about their quid pro quo relationship.

All told, the defendants, which included several IBEW Local 98 union employees and associates, misspent more than $600,000 in union funds, officials said.

The sweeping 160-page presentment alleges that Dougherty and his co-defendants conspired to embezzle union money for their own families, friends and business. They concealed these funds by falsifying documentation to make the money appear union-related, according to the indictment.

Read the complete indictment below.

Charges include conspiracy to embezzle labor union funds, falsification of labor union records, making false statements to the FBI and theft from employee benefits, among many other counts.

Dougherty and Henon have denied all of the allegations.

In addition to Dougherty and Henon, six IBEW Local 98 leaders were also named. They are:

Brian Burrows, president since 2008

Michael Neill, director of training since 2008

Marita Crawford, director of government affairs

Niko Rodriguez, former union apprentice and now-treasurer of Brighter Pennsylvania PAC

Brian Fiocca, union employee and Dougherty's nephew

Anthony Massa, owner and operator of Massa Construction

The defendants allegedly spent thousands of union dollars on expensive family meals, baby supplies, hair styling items and even dog food, federal officials said.

During a birthday dinner for Dougherty in 2015, Crawford used a union credit card to spend more than $1,300 at the Old Homestead restaurant, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, according to the indictment.

Crawford falsely reported to Local 98 that the birthday dinner was a “Political Campaign Meeting Hosted by John Dougherty.”

“I got a different world than most people ever exist in. I am able to take care of a lot of people all the time,"" Dougherty allegedly said to a family member, according to the indictment.

The alleged embezzlement outlined in the indictment took place between 2010 to 2016.

Dougherty's personal attorney, Henry Hockeimer, denied any wrongdoing on behalf of his client.

""Every move he makes is done in order to better the lives of the membership of Local 98. And the dramatic increase in wages, health care benefits and the overall standard of living for the membership is a testament to that singular focus,"" the statement read. ""To allege that John in any way attempted to defraud the Union he cares about so deeply is preposterous.""

The charges point to dizzying schemes between Dougherty and Henon that, ultimately, did benefit the union itself. In July 2015, for example, the two conspired to shut down the installation of a new MRI machine at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia because Local 98 was not given the opportunity to bid on the project. CHOP responded that the manufacturer was installing the machine in order to keep it under warranty should it fail or need repair in the future.

“It is also an L&I violation ... you don’t want a city thing shutting it down,"" Dougherty reportedly told a hospital administrator. ""We have had other hospitals shut down because of that.”

Henon referred the dispute to the city's Department of Licenses and Inspection, which ultimately issued a stop work order for the MRI machine installation.

In another scheme, Henon and Dougherty allegedly pressured Comcast during its franchise licensing agreement talks, according to the indictment. The two warned Comcast that if the cable provider did not hire union workers to install its fiber optic network, city council would not approve the franchise agreement.

Comcast, the parent company of NBC10 and Telemundo62, said it ""cooperated fully"" with the federal investigation and will continue to do so as a fact witness.

The charges revealed Wednesday come more than two years after the FBI and IRS raided over a dozen offices of people connected to IBEW Local 98, including Dougherty.

Earlier this week, two additional associates were indicted.

George Peltz, a South Jersey contractor and an ally of Dougherty's, pleaded guilty to tax evasion, theft from employee benefits and other charges. He admitted to providing more than $60,000 in gifts and free work, including home and office improvements, to an unnamed union official.

Many people have speculated that unnamed official, identified simply as Official No. 1 in federal documents, is Dougherty.

Dr. James Moylan, the former Zoning Board Chairman of Philadelphia, was also indicted in connection with the investigation. Prosecutors said he used more than $40,000 in union donations to pay his business and personal expenses. He stepped down as zoning board chair after federal agents raided his home and chiropractic business.

Despite never holding public office, the 58-year-old Dougherty has long been one of Philadelphia’s most powerful political figures.

He is head of the broader Philadelphia Building Trades Council, and has sat on influential boards, such as the Delaware River Port Authority. Many inside Philadelphia City Hall consider him to be most influential at the municipal level, where he has had a hand in securing votes for several current councilmembers, including former Local 98 protege Henon.

Henon, an electrician by trade, served as the local's political director before being elected to City Council in 2011. He represents the city's 6th District that covers the River Wards, Mayfair, Frankford and other lower Northeast Philly neighborhoods. In 2016, Henon was unanimously elected as Democratic majority leader.

A spokesman for IBEW Local 98 did not respond to a request for comment.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, who received campaign support from IBEW, defended the union's right to contribute to his mayoral campaign.

Speaking to reporters at a different event Wednesday morning, Kenney said he was ""sad"" and disappointed by the federal charges, but is not worried that anyone in his administration will be implicated.

""We’ve had conversations with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and there’s no one in the administration or myself or anyone that is involved in that regard,"" he said.

The mayor recommended that Councilman Henon make the best decision for the people he represents.

“If he stepped down today, his constituents would not be represented for 10 months. So that’s certainly up to him,"" Kenney said.

Henon issued a statement on his Facebook page shortly after the charges were revealed.

""I want to make clear: I have done nothing wrong. I have spent 28 years proudly working for Local 98. In 2011, I ran for City Council to give a voice to honest union men and women, working Philadelphians and those in need of a strong voice to represent them in this great city,"" the statement read.

NBC10 obtained a copy of a letter Dougherty sent to union members Monday that touted recent union successes and said he will ""continue to be your business manager for the foreseeable future.""

Editor's Note: Some NBC10 employees are members of Local 98."

But the bombs mailed to billionaire George Soros, former President Barack Obama, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and others were quite real. And now, similarly, some extremists on the far right are assuming that the violent attack on actor/singer Jussie Smollett in Chicago this week is simply a left-wing plot to discredit Donald Trump’s presidency.

TMZ reported that after Smollett (best known for his portrayal of R&B singer Jamal Lyon on the Fox television series “Empire”) left a Subway in Chicago in the wee hours, he was beaten by two men in ski masks who used racial and anti-gay slurs and told him, “This is MAGA country.” Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, suffered a broken rib but was well enough to be discharged from Chicago’s Northwestern Hospital on Tuesday morning, January 29.

Chicago police are investigating the attack on Smollett, who had been threatened before his arrival in the Windy City. A note sent to Fox’s Chicago studio, according to TMZ, warned, “You will die, black f****r.” But the pro-Trump Reddit page The Donald is full of Trump supporters who insist that Smollett is lying.

One of the Trumpistas on The Donald posted that Smollett “got mugged and is trying to turn himself into a race martyr.” And another described the attack as “another phony hate crime.”

Far-right columnist Michelle Malkin, in a January 30 piece for Creators Syndicate, asserted that she was “skeptical” because descriptions of the attack on Smollett are full of “oddities and discrepancies.” And she believes that media accounts of the attack have all the signs of “manufactured ‘news’” and “smears first, facts later.”

Malkin wrote, “Question: How many racist homophobic menaces wander around the upscale Streeterville neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about ‘MAGA country?’ Question: How many racist homophobic menaces have ever heard of ‘Empire,’ could recognize Jussie Smollett, or know or care anything about his sexuality?”

ADVERTISEMENT

On Steven Crowder’s far-right Louder With Crowder website, editor at large Courtney Kirchoff wondered if TMZ had fabricated the story. Kirchoff wrote, “Is this a possible fake news story? Possibly.”

The Conservative Daily News website has been pushing the “fake news” narrative as well. Contributor Andrew Aleksi-Lankinen wrote, “The claim that two Trump supporters were just waiting with rope and bleach at 2 a.m. for some celebrity to attack makes absolutely no sense whatsoever…. This could all just be a P.R. stunt by Smollett.”

Even right-wing Republicans who are expressing sympathy for Smollett are not safe from outraged Trumpistas and conspiracy buffs who believe that the attack on him is a hoax.

On January 29, anti-Trump conservative Ana Navarro (a frequent guest on CNN) visited Twitter and posted, “I saw Jussie Smollett in Miami last week. I can’t believe this happened. It is sad and disgusting and deplorable.” And a Trump supporter who goes by Jali_Cat was furious with Navarro, tweeting, “You disgusting hateful bitch….. U r the epitome of fake news and of a FAKE REPUBLICAN! Can not WAIT til God knee jerks you down ten notches @ananavarro!”

Another Twitter user, who goes by MidAtlantic Woman, posted, “@ananavarro doesn’t care if it is true, as long as it hurts our President.”

In 2014, Smollett was cast as Jamal Lyon, a gay R&B singer. And the Northern California native came out as gay during a March 2015 interview with Ellen DeGeneres. In addition to his acting, Smollett has recorded an album: 2018’s Sum of My Music."

As the temperature continues to fall below -22 degrees Fahrenheit in the Midwest, breaking records, nearly the entire city will shut down. In addition to Empire, the midseason legal drama Proven Innocent has also been halted, according to E! News.

Chicago will reportedly become colder than parts of Antarctica as the polar vortex keeps temperatures below zero, with a wind chill in the -40s, for the remainder of the week.

The frigid temperatures are only half of the reason for Empire’s shutdown in the wake of the brutal attack on star Jussie Smollett earlier this week. In the early hours of Tuesday, Smollett had been walking on the streets of Chicago when two unknown men reportedly shouted racial and homophobic slurs at the actor before physically beating him. According to a police report, the assailants poured a chemical substance onto Smollett’s face and tied a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene. They also left a threatening message with Smollett, telling him he will “die.”

Smollett rushed himself to the hospital, where he is said to be in good condition, TVLine reported.

A number of Smollett’s co-stars have since spoken out against the attackers and wished Smollett well. Terrence Howard, who plays the father of Smollett’s character on Fox’s musical drama, reacted to the news on Good Morning America on Wednesday.

“I heard he’s getting better. He’s angry, but I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate, and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance,” Howard said.

Howard also revealed that Fox had previously received letters warning the network about potential attacks such as this, according to Entertainment Tonight. Fox has since increased security around Empire’s production site in Chicago.

The network released their own statement about the tragic attack this week on social media, expressing their “deep sadness and outrage.”

“We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,” Fox’s statement read. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

As the cast and crew of Empire cope with the news, counselors and a SAG-AFTRA representative will reportedly be on the set for the next few weeks when the series returns to production.

Smollett could potentially return to set as early as next week, Deadline reported. However, the frigid weather conditions will continue to play a role in determining the show’s production schedule."

Taraji P. Henson has joined her Empire co-stars in addressing the brutal attack on Jussie Smollett.

The actress, 48, took to Instagram on Wednesday evening to show her support for the 35-year-old actor after he was attacked by two men in Chicago on Tuesday night.

In a passionate post, she wrote, ‘I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now.

‘@JussieSmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him.

‘The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain and that is all I know. This song needs to be downloaded until it goes triple platinum because the message is NEEDED.’

She finished, ‘The love so many have him just goes to show HE IS LOVE!!!! I LOVE YOU MY BABY MY BABY!!!’

Taraji spoke out shortly after co-star Terrence Howard, who plays Jussie’s father in the show, addressed the attack on Good Morning America.

‘I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,’ Howard told the GMA hosts.

‘But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.’

‘Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood,’ Howard continued. ‘He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping.

‘No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family – you know, the Fox family, the Empire family, the Lyon family – were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.’

Jussie was ‘brutally attacked’ by two men wearing ski masks at around 2am on Tuesday morning in an incident police are investigating as a ‘possible hate crime’.

The 35-year-old actor had arrived in the city late on Monday and headed to Subway for food at around 2am, when he was approached by the men.

It’s been claimed they asked him: ‘Aren’t you that f****t Empire n*****?’ before beating him, ‘putting a rope around his neck and pouring bleach on him’.

It’s thought Jussie still had a rope around his neck when he made contact with Chicago PD and in a follow up interview he said they yelled ‘MAGA country’ as they walked away.

The hosts of The Grand Tour have been accused of ‘homophobia’ by pop star Will Young, but this is only the latest instance.

Presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May are known for their divisive humour, first as the faces of Top Gear and now on Amazon Prime.

Here’s a look back at some of the controversial comments that have brought them under fire.

Richard Hammond suggests only gay people eat ice cream

In 2016 Hammond came under fire for saying the reason why he doesn’t eat ice cream is ‘something to do with being straight’.

He was responding to Clarkson pointing out that ‘you couldn’t enjoy a chocolate Magnum ice cream’ in a Rolls Royce because of the swanky interior.

Clarkson said: ‘Are you saying everyone who likes ice cream… you’re saying all children are homosexual?’

🤗 hello & here's the full richard hammond 'ice creams are gay' piece and yeah, it's awful pic.twitter.com/JhDisRsc1Q — ollie cole (@ProducerOllie) December 26, 2016

Hammond replied: ‘No. There’s nothing wrong with it, but you know – a grown man eating an ice cream is a bit…it’s that way rather than that way.’

The presenter defended the joke insisting that he ‘wasn’t being serious’.

He told The Times: ‘Love is love, whatever the sex of the two people in love.

‘It may be because I live in a hideously safe and contained middle-class world, where a person’s sexuality is not an issue. But when I hear of people in the media coming out, I think, why do they even feel the need to mention it?

‘It is so old-fashioned to make a big deal of it. That isn’t even an interesting thing to say at a dinner party any more.’

Jeremy Clarkson vs George Michael

Way back in 2011 George Michael called Clarkson ‘pig ugly’ and ‘homophobic’ after the singer made him the subject of a joke on Top Gear.

In the episode, Jeremy reviewed the Jaguar XKR-S and said: ‘It’s very fast and very, very loud. And then in the corners it will get its tail out more readily than George Michael’.

It came after the singer, who died in 2016, joked in a video he shared that he sounded like ‘Jeremy Clarkson with someone’s finger up his arse’.

Michael tweeted at the time: ‘Good grief Mr.Clarkson, I wasn’t implying your towering heterosexuality was in question. I had no desire to insult you! But I do now, you pig-ugly homophobic t**t!!!!!’

Jeremy Clarkson jokes he and Richard Hammond are ‘fudge packers’

We have got jobs at last. Here. As packers. pic.twitter.com/93dkPuVRbu — Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) July 20, 2015

In 2015, the same year he was sacked by the BBC after punching Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon, Jeremy joked that he and Hammond had found new jobs.

He posted a picture on Twitter of them both stood out Margaret River Fudge Factory in Australia and added the caption: ‘We have got jobs at last. Here. As packers.’

‘Fudge packer’ is a slur used to refer to gay men.

The Wrangler Jeep

Will Young took issue with the recent episode of The Grand Tour (Picture: Amazon Prime)

In the two-part Columbia special of The Grand Tour season three, Clarkson’s co-hosts imply that his vehicle, a Wrangler Jeep, is driven by gay men.

Hammond goes on to suggest some clothes for Clarkson: ‘Maybe some nice chaps. Suede, ventilated at the back’.

The jeep later gets stuck in a ditch and has to be pulled out by James’ car.

‘Jeremy Corbyn just pulled Freddie Mercury out’, Clarkson says.

Will Young accused the presenters of ‘stereotyping gay men’ (Picture: Getty)

In an angry outburst on Twitter, Will took issue with a joke in one of the episodes about the Wrangler Jeep being a ‘gay man’s car’.

The Pop Idol winner, who came out in 2002, called the remarks ‘sad and shaming’ and threatened to take action. Ofcom has since received a complaint about the joke.

‘A bit ginger beer’

Clarkson found himself in trouble with Ofcom for describing a Daihatsu Copen as ‘a bit gay’ on Top Gear in 2006.

When asked if he would buy the vehicle, he said: ‘No, it’s a bit gay. A bit gay, yes, very ginger beer’, believed to be rhyming slang for ‘queer’.

Ofcom ruled at the time that his use of the word ‘gay’ was ‘capable of giving offence’.

The Grand Tour declined to comment on Will Young’s tweets when contacted by Metro.co.uk.

The Grand Tour is released on Fridays on Amazon Prime

The police could not confirm the gender of the offenders or identify the chemical substance.

“At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victims neck,” the statement said."

The 160-page indictment alleges that Dougherty and his co-defendants conspired to embezzle union money for their own use.

The embezzlement charges stem from falsified financial records from 2010 to 2016.

Baby wipes, Q-Tips, bottled water and expensive dinners were all part of an elaborate embezzlement scheme by powerful electricians' union leader John ""Johnny Doc"" Dougherty and Philadelphia Councilman Bobby Henon, according to a federal charging document unsealed Wednesday morning.

Dougherty, whose brother sits on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, exerted complete control over the union, according to the 116-count indictment, using that power to ""repeatedly and persistently steal its funds and put his own self-interests over that of the membership.""

He also helped propel Henon, a Local 98 staffer, into a powerful leadership position on the Philadelphia City Council to apply pressure to other trade groups and businesses, prosecutors allege.

“I don’t give a f--- about anybody, all right, but f---ing you and us, and you know that,"" Henon told Dougherty in 2015 when reassuring him about their quid pro quo relationship.

All told, the defendants, which included several IBEW Local 98 union employees and associates, misspent more than $600,000 in union funds, officials said.

The sweeping 160-page presentment alleges that Dougherty and his co-defendants conspired to embezzle union money for their own families, friends and business. They concealed these funds by falsifying documentation to make the money appear union-related, according to the indictment.

Read the complete indictment below.

Charges include conspiracy to embezzle labor union funds, falsification of labor union records, making false statements to the FBI and theft from employee benefits, among many other counts.

Dougherty and Henon have denied all of the allegations.

In addition to Dougherty and Henon, six IBEW Local 98 leaders were also named. They are:

Brian Burrows, president since 2008

Michael Neill, director of training since 2008

Marita Crawford, director of government affairs

Niko Rodriguez, former union apprentice and now-treasurer of Brighter Pennsylvania PAC

Brian Fiocca, union employee and Dougherty's nephew

Anthony Massa, owner and operator of Massa Construction

The defendants allegedly spent thousands of union dollars on expensive family meals, baby supplies, hair styling items and even dog food, federal officials said.

During a birthday dinner for Dougherty in 2015, Crawford used a union credit card to spend more than $1,300 at the Old Homestead restaurant, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, according to the indictment.

Crawford falsely reported to Local 98 that the birthday dinner was a “Political Campaign Meeting Hosted by John Dougherty.”

“I got a different world than most people ever exist in. I am able to take care of a lot of people all the time,"" Dougherty allegedly said to a family member, according to the indictment.

The alleged embezzlement outlined in the indictment took place between 2010 to 2016.

Dougherty's personal attorney, Henry Hockeimer, denied any wrongdoing on behalf of his client.

""Every move he makes is done in order to better the lives of the membership of Local 98. And the dramatic increase in wages, health care benefits and the overall standard of living for the membership is a testament to that singular focus,"" the statement read. ""To allege that John in any way attempted to defraud the Union he cares about so deeply is preposterous.""

The charges point to dizzying schemes between Dougherty and Henon that, ultimately, did benefit the union itself. In July 2015, for example, the two conspired to shut down the installation of a new MRI machine at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia because Local 98 was not given the opportunity to bid on the project. CHOP responded that the manufacturer was installing the machine in order to keep it under warranty should it fail or need repair in the future.

“It is also an L&I violation ... you don’t want a city thing shutting it down,"" Dougherty reportedly told a hospital administrator. ""We have had other hospitals shut down because of that.”

Henon referred the dispute to the city's Department of Licenses and Inspection, which ultimately issued a stop work order for the MRI machine installation.

In another scheme, Henon and Dougherty allegedly pressured Comcast during its franchise licensing agreement talks, according to the indictment. The two warned Comcast that if the cable provider did not hire union workers to install its fiber optic network, city council would not approve the franchise agreement.

Comcast, the parent company of NBC10 and Telemundo62, said it ""cooperated fully"" with the federal investigation and will continue to do so as a fact witness.

The charges revealed Wednesday come more than two years after the FBI and IRS raided over a dozen offices of people connected to IBEW Local 98, including Dougherty.

Earlier this week, two additional associates were indicted.

George Peltz, a South Jersey contractor and an ally of Dougherty's, pleaded guilty to tax evasion, theft from employee benefits and other charges. He admitted to providing more than $60,000 in gifts and free work, including home and office improvements, to an unnamed union official.

Many people have speculated that unnamed official, identified simply as Official No. 1 in federal documents, is Dougherty.

Dr. James Moylan, the former Zoning Board Chairman of Philadelphia, was also indicted in connection with the investigation. Prosecutors said he used more than $40,000 in union donations to pay his business and personal expenses. He stepped down as zoning board chair after federal agents raided his home and chiropractic business.

Despite never holding public office, the 58-year-old Dougherty has long been one of Philadelphia’s most powerful political figures.

He is head of the broader Philadelphia Building Trades Council, and has sat on influential boards, such as the Delaware River Port Authority. Many inside Philadelphia City Hall consider him to be most influential at the municipal level, where he has had a hand in securing votes for several current councilmembers, including former Local 98 protege Henon.

Henon, an electrician by trade, served as the local's political director before being elected to City Council in 2011. He represents the city's 6th District that covers the River Wards, Mayfair, Frankford and other lower Northeast Philly neighborhoods. In 2016, Henon was unanimously elected as Democratic majority leader.

A spokesman for IBEW Local 98 did not respond to a request for comment.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, who received campaign support from IBEW, defended the union's right to contribute to his mayoral campaign.

Speaking to reporters at a different event Wednesday morning, Kenney said he was ""sad"" and disappointed by the federal charges, but is not worried that anyone in his administration will be implicated.

""We’ve had conversations with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and there’s no one in the administration or myself or anyone that is involved in that regard,"" he said.

The mayor recommended that Councilman Henon make the best decision for the people he represents.

“If he stepped down today, his constituents would not be represented for 10 months. So that’s certainly up to him,"" Kenney said.

Henon issued a statement on his Facebook page shortly after the charges were revealed.

""I want to make clear: I have done nothing wrong. I have spent 28 years proudly working for Local 98. In 2011, I ran for City Council to give a voice to honest union men and women, working Philadelphians and those in need of a strong voice to represent them in this great city,"" the statement read.

NBC10 obtained a copy of a letter Dougherty sent to union members Monday that touted recent union successes and said he will ""continue to be your business manager for the foreseeable future.""

Henson has said “hate will not win” after her Empire co-star Jussie Smollett was attacked in what police suspect was a hate crime.

The 35-year-old actor, who is black and came out as gay in 2015, was approached by two men in downtown Chicago at about 2am on Tuesday, police said. Celebrities have rallied around Empire star Jussie Smollett (Victoria Will/Invision/AP File)

He was struck in the face before having an “unknown chemical substance” poured over him and a rope wrapped around his neck, according to investigators.

The suspects shouted racial and homophobic slurs during the attack, police said. No arrests have been made.

The Hollywood star, who plays Smollett’s mother on the TV show, shared a clip from one of his music videos on Instagram and wrote: “I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now.

“@jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!!

“I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him.

“The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.”

Police also confirmed Smollett told them his attackers made reference to MAGA – Make America Great Again – which was Donald Trump’s slogan during the 2016 US presidential campaign.

Smollett has starred in Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terence Howard.

Howard told Good Morning America: “Our jaws dropped to the ground and when we learned that there had been letters that had been sent to Fox as threats about the potential of something like this, then we became much more frightened.”

He added: “He’s angry, but I known Jussie, his anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t – we cannot – forget their actions.

“They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

Other stars have also rallied around Smollett after the attack, with Chadwick Boseman writing on Instagram: “Praying for you, brother. Your light is so much stronger than their hate.”>

Emma Watson wrote on Twitter: “Disgusted by the ugly prejudice and bigotry behind this violence. Sending love to @JussieSmollett & to anyone that has been hurt by the hatred of those who fear difference.

“As a society, we continue to fail LGBTQIA+ communities and PoC.”

Michael B Jordan wrote on Instagram: “Stand with my brother @jussiesmollett sending you light and love. Be strong We got you.”>

Queer Eye host Jonathan Van Ness said “queer people are attacked every single day”, adding: “We have not come as far as we think.”

Kevin Hart, who stepped down from his role as Oscars host after historical homophobic tweets surfaced, also sent Smollett a message of support.

He wrote on Instagram: “Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better.”

US president Trump is yet to comment, despite pressure to do so.

Earlier, Empire creator Lee Daniels reacted to the attack and said “America is better than that”.

In an emotional video to Instagram, Daniels called Smollett his “son”, before calling for change.

He said: “It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.”

As well as his acting, Smollett is also a singer and activist who has advocated HIV/Aids prevention.

Rush said he was “disturbed” by reports that the two attackers allegedly wrapped a noose around Smollett’s neck, an act Rush described as an “attempted lynching” that “harkens back to some of the darkest days in our history.”

AD

Last year, Rush introduced legislation that would make lynching a federal crime. The measure was co-sponsored by nearly three-dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus. At the time, Rush said the legislation was necessary given the resurgence of white nationalism as evidenced by recent events such as the 2017 rally in Charlottesville.

AD

“While many may argue that lynching has been relegated to history, you only need to look at the events in Charlottesville last year to be reminded that the racist and hateful sentiments that spurred these abhorrent crimes are still prevalent in today’s American society,” he said at the time.

On Wednesday, Rush renewed his call for Congress to take up his legislation, which he said would “ensure perpetrators receive an enhanced sentence under hate crimes statutes.”

Smollett, 35, was walking on a Chicago street at about 2 a.m. local time Tuesday “when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department said in a statement.

“The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” the statement said. “At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

Smollett told detectives his attackers said “something to the effect of ‘this is MAGA country,’ ” an apparent reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, during the assault.

""@jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!!""

She encouraged supporters to download Smollett's song ""F.U.W."" (Effed-Up World), whose lyrics include the apt lines, ""Why are we back in the past? It's the same script, different cast.""

""My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know. This song needs to be downloaded until it goes triple platinum because the message is NEEDED.""

The latest on the Smollett investigation: Attackers yelled 'This is MAGA country'

In a Wednesday interview with ""Good Morning America,"" Terrence Howard, who plays ""Empire"" family patriarch Lucious Lyon, said that his jaw ""dropped to the ground"" upon hearing of the attack on Smollett. ""And then when we learned that there had been letters that had been sent to Fox as threats about the potential of something like this, then we became much more frightened.""

Smollett's co-star Vivica A. Fox echoed that statement, writing in a tweet, ""I'm just now hearing the news about the senseless hate attack on my #EMPiRE Nephew @JussieSmollett IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!! SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE! PRAYERS UP TO U NEPHEW!""

Supermodel Naomi Campbell, who starred on the first two seasons of ""Empire,"" shared a photo of her and Smollett on Instagram, imploring both Daniels and Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, to take action.

""One of the most beautiful things that happen to me when working on Empire was meeting @jussiesmollett !! Lee, @theoriginalbigdaddy please do something.

Grace Byers, who played Anika Calhoun, shared a touching Instagram message.

""It’s indisputable that one of Jussie’s purpose-gifts is the ability to unify through love. It’s who he is,"" she wrote. It’s what he does. His blazon of light can never - and will never - be diminished, quelled or subdued,"" Byers wrote alongside a picture of the pair. ""This despicable act only shamefully reveals how deeply the diseases of hatred, inequality, racism and discrimination continue to course through our country’s veins.""

Co-star Ta'Rhonda Jones (Porsha) told Smollett, ""I am TORN, I am ANGRY yet inspired by your strength. Took me a while to gather my thoughts & I’m still short of words! @JussieSmollett just know that you are loved!""

""Empire"" co-creator Lee Daniels, who, like Smollett, is gay, shared his thoughts in a passionate, lengthy and NSFW Instagram video.

""It's taken me a minute to come to social media about this, because Jussie, you are my son. You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called 'die, (expletive), (expletive),' or whatever they said to you,"" Daniels said.

""You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that,"" he added. It starts at home, we have to love each other – regardless of what sexual orientation we are.""

Daniels concluded: ""No racist (expletive) can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up Jussie, I'm with you I'll be there in a minute.""

Co-creator Danny Strong added, ""I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett.

Smith after her husband opened up about his relationship with another woman as his wife battles Alzheimer’s disease.

B. Smith, 69, a former model and restaurateur, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2014. She has been married to her husband Dan Gasby, 64, since 1992. He spoke about his girlfriend, Alex Lerner, in a profile for The Washington Post.

Lerner has a room in the house where Smith and her husband live. Gasby described the relationship to two hit television shows.

“If ‘This Is Us’ and ‘Modern Family’ came together, it would be us,” Gasby told the Post.

Gasby went public with his relationship with Lerner in December.

“What I admire about him, is that he takes care of her,” Lerner said of Gasby.

After the profile was published, Gasby took to Facebook to address his critics.

“B. Smith’s worst day is 10x better than you’ve experienced. I love my wife but I can’t let her take away my life!” he wrote on their joint Facebook account.

The Washington Post noted that a number of critics have flooded Gasby’s Facebook page with comments slamming him for dating while his wife battled the disease.

“You don’t bring your mistress in the house where your WIFE lives. She’s not dead,” a social media user wrote on Facebook.

“This is really selfish. There are plenty of women who have taken care of their husbands as they have become paralyzed, had a stroke, had Alzheimer’s, and never was it cool for them to take a man and move him into their home so they could be happy with the rest of their lives,” a social media user commented.

“I love my wife, but can’t let her take my life away. Disgusting!!” another comment read.

Gasby spoke about his wife’s battle with Alzheimer’s to Fox News in 2015.

“When you talk to someone and say you have someone in your family who’s a caregiver, and you look each other in the eye, you know exactly what the other person is experiencing,” Gasby said. “When someone says, ‘I can’t imagine,’ the caregiver doesn’t have to imagine — they know.”"

Kevin Hart was among many celebrities to address the incident, taking to Instagram to send his prayers to the 35-year-old star, writing, “Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate????”

Hart continued: “I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

While nobody took issue with Hart’s sentiments, numerous people did call him out for the hypocrisy of decrying a homophobic attack in light of the comedian’s well-documented homophobic tweets from nearly a decade ago.

The backlash came quickly, such as this tweet from TV writer Ira Madison III, who referenced Hart’s infamous comments about his fears his son may be gay. “Yo if my son comes home & try’s 2 play with my daughters doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay,'” Hart tweeted in 2011.

This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny — Ira (@ira) January 29, 2019

Also commenting was filmmaker Sam Greisman, son of Oscar-winning actress Sally Field.

But keep joking about beating up your kid for being gay, Kevin Hart! — sam greisman (@SAMGREIS) January 29, 2019

And that was just the tip of the iceberg. Check out more backlash to Hart’s comments about Smollett:

Do you see why the “jokes” weren’t funny now?? — Bethany West (@niale_west) January 30, 2019

Where’s Kevin Hart and DL Hughley with some more of their little homophobic jokes? Since it’s all just funny and accountability isn’t important. — Preston Mitchum (@PrestonMitchum) January 29, 2019

Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks. Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart. — Saeed Jones (@theferocity) January 29, 2019

This is your reminder that Kevin Hart was given a publicity tour to declare that being an ally to LGBTQ folks is not his life's goal or dream and that he's done apologizing. This is your reminder that his jokes reflect actual attitudes that produce what happened to Jussie. — Dana (@DanaVivianWhite) January 29, 2019

Keep yo tears n prayers…This is why yo joke was important and such an issue — Jerry Ford, Jr., MPP♦️ (@JerryFordJr) January 30, 2019

In a Tweet responding to the controversy, Hart says he is an example of change.

“I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heartfelt support and you take the time to harp on my 10 year past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person,” he wrote. “Do you want change? If so I am an example of what you want people to do… CHANGE!”"

Chicago police are reportedly reviewing hundreds of hours of closed circut video footage from city and private cameras in the Streeterville neighborhood in a search for clues about the two men who allegedly attacked Empire actor Jussie Smollett on Tuesday morning (Jan. 29).

According to the Chicago Tribune, police exanded their search area along the Chicago riverfront on Tuesday night in an effort to find any images of the alleged suspects or their cars.

Police said Smollett, 36, was attacked in what is believed to be a hate crime around 2:00 a.m. by two unnamed suspects who began yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, punching and kicking the actor who plays Jamal Lyon on the long-running Fox musical drama. The assailants reportedly punched Smollett in the face, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him, then wrapped a rope around his neck. ""The Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire,"" read a statement from the Chicago PD. ""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.

The Tribune reported that police radio traffic asked officers to check in on a report from a caller in an apartment on East North Water Street around 2:30 a.m., with a friend of the openly gay actor telling responding police that a ""noose was placed over the friend's neck."" By early Tuesday afternoon, detectives obtained video from the area, but had not identified any suspects; at press time a Chicago PD spokesperson told Billboard that there were not updates on the identities of the alleged assailants.

Police also confirmed that a letter with anti-gay epithets and white powder were mailed to the studios where Empire is filmed on Jan. 22, addressed to one of the show's actors, triggering a hazardous materials call to fire officials who determined the powder was not hazardous; the FBI has taken over the probe into the letter. TMZ reported on Wednesday that Smollett had turned down an offer of extra security in the wake of the letter as security was beefed up for all the cast members last week on the Chicago set of the show.

According to the Tribune, CNN anchor Don Lemon reported on air that he had spoken to Smollett, who confirmed the incident and said he was shaken and angry about the attack, during which the men reportedly yelled, ""Aren't you that faggot Empire n----r?"" as Smollett was leaving a Subway sandwich shop by himself.

TMZ described the alleged attackers as white men wearing ski masks to conceal their faces, who allegedly attacked Smollett as he fought back -- sustaining a fractured rib in the process -- yelling ""This is MAGA country"" as they fled the scene; police would not confirm the reported slurs used by the attackers or the alleged reference to the hat associated with President Donald Trump's ""Make American Great Again"" campaign slogan. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that a police spokesperson said Smollett was initially ""reluctant"" to call police because of the attention it would draw, but that his manager eventually summoned authorities around 2:42 a.m., 40 minutes after the attack.

When officers arrived at the apartment the ""thin, light rope"" was reportedly still around Smollett's neck and the actor asked officers to turn off their body cameras while interviewing him, which the paper said is a standard request from victims. Police encouraged Smollett to go to Northwestern Memorial Hospital to get treatment for lacerations on his face and neck. The actor was treated and released from the hospital a short time later, after initially telling officers that the attackers were two men wearing ski masks and all-black clothing.

On Wednesday morning, according to the Sun-Times, Smollett told detectives that the men also yelled ""this is MAGA country"" after they attacked him, though he was unable to provide any description of them, including their race. At press time police told Billboard that they had not uncovered any eyewitnesses or video of the attack.

Smollett has gotten support from dozens of fellow stars and fans in the wake of the attack, including Ariana Grande, who said the incident made her ""really fucking sick to my stomach,"" as well as one of the show's executive producers, Brian Grazer. The famed producer told TMZ, ""It's the worst thing possible. Theres's nothing worse that than,"" calling Smollett a ""giganticaly talented and authentic artist...a giver, not a taker,"" and labeling the attack a ""hate crime."" Grazer's longtime producing partner and friend, Ron Howard, added ""it's fucking infuriating.""

In addition to impassioned messages of support from the show's co-creators, Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, Smollett also got loving tweets and Instas of support from co-star Taraji P. Henson and many others."

Sources linked to the show’s production team told TMZ that Smollett, 35, declined Fox’s offer for extra security during his downtime as he felt the measure was intrusive. They also claimed that since Tuesday’s incident, armed security is protecting Smollett around-the-clock at least until his attackers are arrested.

Smollett was reportedly exiting a Chicago Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. Tuesday when one of two men in ski masks asked him, “Aren’t you that f**** ‘Empire’ n****r?” before they both attacked the openly gay, black actor. Reports indicated that the men also tied a noose around his neck and dumped a liquid, possibly bleach, on him before fleeing the scene.

The alleged letter in question, obtained by ThatGrapeJuice.net, reads, “You will die black f*g,” in cut-and-paste magazine clippings. The letter apparently also appears to show a red stick figure being shot with a gun. ABC News reported that the envelope contained a powdery substance that was likely Tylenol.

According to recent reports, the FBI is also involved in the ongoing investigation.

“We’re deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” Fox said in a statement. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.”

Jussie Smollett, a cast member on the Fox series “Empire,” told police that he was walking in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street around 2 a.m. Tuesday when two people walked up to him and yelled racist and homophobic slurs before hitting him in the face, pouring a substance on him — suspected to be bleach — and putting a rope around his neck.

“As you are aware, crimes of this nature strike fear at the very core of a community and have a long-lasting impact on its members,” Rush wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday. “They are, therefore, rightfully characterized as hate crimes.”

Smollett initially told police his attackers were two men wearing ski masks and all black clothing. In a follow-up interview, Smollett told detectives the men also yelled “this is MAGA country” after they attacked him, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. Smollett didn’t provide any other description of the men, including their race.

Police have yet to recover any video footage showing the reported attack and have not been able to find any witnesses.

The block where the attack took place has some parking garage entrances but no retail businesses. But police were able to recover video from various business, residential and police cameras in the wider area. A surveillance camera at the Subway shows Smollett at the restaurant.

More than a dozen police detectives, some specializing in hate crimes, are working the case. They asked anyone with who has information or witnessed the attack to call detectives at (312) 747-8382 or submit an anonymous tip at cpdtip.com.

The FBI is already investigating a separate incident involving Smollett.

On Jan. 22, a letter with “threatening language” was sent to the Fox and “Empire” offices.

The letter was laced with some type of white, powdery substance, according to Guglielmi.

A celebrity website, GrapeJuice.net, published a picture of the letter with the words, “You will die black f–,” written in letters apparently cut from magazines."

Right wing nuts are already finding ways to discredit yesterday’s racist and homophobic attack against Jussie Smollett.

Smollett was reportedly attacked by two white men wearing ski masks who shouted, “Aren’t you that f*ggot ‘Empire’ n*gger?” before pouncing on him, breaking his rib, sliding a noose around his neck, dousing him in bleach, and screaming “This is MAGA country!” then fleeing the scene.

In an article headlined “Shifting Stories Cloud Claims of Alleged Hate Crime Attack Targeting ‘Empire’ Actor Jussie Smollett”, Patrick Poole over at PJ Media claims “conflicting versions of the incident” have “raised questions about what actually happened”.

The “conflicting version of the incident” he is referring to is the fact that Smollett didn’t mention the fact that the attackers shouted “This is MAGA country!” until his second police interview.

Naturally, Poole suggests, this means the whole thing must be a lie. It couldn’t possibly be that Smollett didn’t mention the MAGA remarks in his first police interview because, oh, I dunno, he had just been attacked, was in shock, and was still processing what happened.

Poole also says police haven’t found any video of the alleged assailants, which must also mean the whole thing is a fabrication, because, as everyone knows… PICS OR IT DIDN’T HAPPEN! And he notes that a screenshot of Smollett in the hospital was posted online by Empire creator Lee Danels but has since been removed, which is also apparently suspect.

Meanwhile, over a Breitbart, Joel B. Pollak points a finger at the NAACP for “blaming President Trump” for the “alleged racist attack” and then goes out of his way to note that Smollett “drove himself to a nearby hospital.” The implication being that, since he wasn’t taken in an ambulance, his injuries must not have been that bad.

Then there’s Cristina Laila over at The Gateway Pundit who notes that it’s “freezing” in Chicago then pose the questions: “Why on earth would two white Trump supporters be hanging around in subfreezing temps with rope and bleach and just happen to run into a celebrity and recognize him at 2 AM in the streets of Chicago?”

Oh, let’s not forget about the trolls on Twitter…

Unlike many celebrities before him, however, Hart has a history of homophobic Tweets and quips.

And the Internet was not about to let the so-called comedian forget it.

Smollett, one of the key cast members on the FOX drama Empire, was harassed and then assaulted by two men in Chicago very early on Tuesday morning.

They hurled anti-gay and racist slurs at the actor, only to then wrap a rope around his neck and pour bleach all over him, after fracturing his ribs and injuring Smollett in other ways as well.

It was a truly horrific attack.

Shortly after news of this heinous incident went viral, Hart Tweeted the following:

“Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad.

Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate????

God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love.

I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.

Nice sentiment, we suppose, but here's the thing:

Hart recently lost the job of Academy Awards host after the public learned that he had posted many anti-gay messages back in the day, while also making awful jokes on stage about homosexuality.

“One of my biggest fears is my son growing up and being gay,"" Hart once said, adding: ""If I can prevent my son from being gay, I will.”

Har har? Not exactly.

This viewpoint wasn't lost on Internet users, either.

“This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny,” wrote TV writer Ira Madison III, while filmmaker Sam Greisman, who is the son of actress Sally Field, agreed.

“But keep joking about beating up your kid for being gay, Kevin Hart!” he wrote directly to/about Hart.

Elsewhere, along these similar lines:

Poet Saeed Jones referenced Hart’s post-Oscars scandal interview with Ellen DeGeneres, who urged people to give the comedian a second change, writing:

“Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks.

""Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart.”

The two men who beat Smollett up screamed ""This is MAGA country"" at the star, according to various reports.

President Trump has not yet commented on the assault or this aspect of it, either.

The Chicago Police Department says detectives are investigating the incident and “treating it as a possible hate crime,"" while the FBI is looking into a death threat that had previously been sent to Smollett.

The talk show host on Wednesday posted a video on his Instagram page and shared his thoughts on the Jan. 28 alleged attack on the “Empire” actor, who was doused in bleach and had a noose wrapped around his neck.

“I’ve listened to a lot of people’s words and I don’t have a lot of eloquent stuff to say,” Harvey explains in the Jan. 29 video. “To little brother, Jussie, as a black man in this country, I’m down with you. And I know brothers that’s down with you. This ain’t about sexual preference or nothing. This is about coming to the aid of a brother that has tasted the brutality of hatred, racism and bigotry. So, we down with you, Jussie. However you gon’ handle it, we down with you.

“This is not a call for violence … I just don’t have all the words everybody else got. We down with you, soldier,” he added. “Just want you to know that your OGs down with you. Man, we gon’ pray for you, brother.”

A hate crime investigation has been launched in Chicago, where Smollett said he had been “viciously attacked” by two white men wearing ski masks, according to TMZ. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the actor claimed the men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. Jussie was seen at a local Subway around the time of the attack.

“Aren’t you that f—ot Empire n—er?” TMZ reported the men shouted, along with, “This is MAGA country!”

Smollett said he was hit in the face, and he reportedly has a fractured rib. Additionally, they are said to have poured bleach on him before putting a noose around his neck. Smollett took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was treated for his injuries and released.

Harvey’s fans eagerly backed up the comic’s peaceful call to action.

“We ALL should be down with him. Are we not tired of this mess yet? When is it going to be the last straw? 😡😢”

“OG has Spoken.👌 We down with U.🙏”

“Praying for this awesome young man! God bless him.. Jussie Smollett!!! Thanks @Steve harvey.”

Harvey is not alone in speaking out in support of Smollett. Viola Davis, Chadwick Boseman, Nene Leakes and Kelly Rowland are among several celebrities who have backed the star.

He was shaken and angry that an attack like this could happen. Smollett told CNN he fought back at the attackers.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” the police statement said.

Smollett has starred on Fox’s “Empire” since 2015. He plays Jamal, a successful singer in the musical Lyon family. Like his character, Smollett identifies as gay.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our ‘Empire’ family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” a representative of 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to CNN. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

A representative for GLAAD told CNN the organization has reached out Smollett to offer assistance and support.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” a GLAAD spokesperson said in a statement."

The 39-year-old comedian took to Instagram to post a snap of the 35-year-old Empire star with a lengthy message of encouragement.

The Ride Along star has recently been under fire for his homophobic jokes and tweets in the past which recently led to him dropping out as host of The Oscars.

Ouch: Many on social media took aim at Hart for his prior homophobic jokes and tweets including filmmaker and Sally Field's son Sam Greisman

Kevin wrote: 'Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad.

'Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother'

Before dropping out of the Oscars gig, Kevin had deleted some tweets including one from 2011 in which he joked about abusing his son if he were gay.

Television writer and host of Crooked Media podcast Keep It, Ira Madison, shed light on those posts as he wrote: 'This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny.'

As Ellen DeGeneres supported Hart after dropping out of the gig, which created another controversy, many blasted the both of them for their posts.

Jonathan Van Ness who stars on highly-popular Netflix series Queer Eye tweeted: 'The hate crime that happened today is an attack on us all. Queer people of color need allies, queer people need allies. Kevin Hart so quiet right now. Where are the allies Ellen? Maga hat wearing people need to be checked - we gotta WAKE UP people, it’s going down.'

Poet Saeed Jones wrote: 'Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks. Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart.'

Unrelenting: Many in the Twitterverse went after Hart

Dozens of fans also chimed in blasting Kevin on both Twitter and Instagram over his past comments.

Several other celebrities also offered up their support on social media including Janet Jackson, Naomi Campbell, Lee Daniels, and John Legend.

Smollett, 35, was beaten, had bleach poured on him, and a noose tied around his neck by two white men in ski masks shouting 'this is MAGA country' at 2am on Tuesday in Chicago.

The actor, who came out as gay to Ellen in 2015, was jumped by two men as he walking from a local Subway sandwich shop and the two men started yelling homophobic and racial slurs including: 'Aren't you the f***ot 'Empire' n*****?'

Smollett suffered a fractured rib during the attack and is said to have put up a fight when he was beaten.

Not pleased: Many fans replied directly to the comedian's post as they criticized him, one even using the popular Spider-Man pointing meme

A noose was still around his neck at 2.42am when police arrived to the scene.

The actor then took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he was treated then released on Tuesday.

He told CNN that he was shaken and angry following the incident.

Hart was named as the host of the 91st Academy Awards in December. He took proudly to social media afterwards to announce it but his elation was short-lived.

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, that appears to be dated from January 18, stating that 'You will die black f*g'. Fox Studio received the letter on the 22nd and cops said it was laced with powder Tylenol

Smollett was jumped here in the upscale downtown Chicago neighborhood of Streeterville. Cops were unable to find any still images or video surveillance footage of the attack or the assailants

Within days, Twitter users had unearthed his old tweets and demanded that he be removed.

Among them were posts where he labeled people 'f**gs' and jokes about what he would do if his son came out as gay.

Despite the backlash, Hart refused to apologize and instead quit over the controversy, blindsiding the Academy and leaving them without a host.

He said the Oscars gave him an ultimatum; apologize or give up the gig. He chose the latter.

Moving on: Hart was named as the host of the 91st Academy Awards in December. He took proudly to social media afterwards to announce it but his elation was short-lived

Later, he appeared on Ellen where both he and she called for viewers to embrace growth and change.

During their interview, she revealed that she had even called the Academy to ask if Hart could still host the show and said she was told he could.

Ellen, who has long been an icon in the LGBTQ community, was lampooned for throwing her support behind the comedian afterwards.

Hart later came to her defense, saying: 'When did we get to the point where we forgot that we all learn, then we all have the ability to grow and with that growth comes a wealth of knowledge.

'You can’t change without a understanding of what GROWTH means.'"

Police, according to CNN, are looking for surveillance video of the attack — and are looking into reports that the attackers shouted racist or homophobic slurs at the actor, who is both African-American and openly gay.

Smollett came out publicly for the first time to Ellen DeGeneres in a backstage interview conducted in March of 2015 — around the time of his debut on Empire, in which he plays a gay character, per Variety. Smollett declared in the interview that while he doesn’t like to talk about his personal life, “there is no closet,” and that he had never hidden his identity at any point. He also praised DeGeneres as an inspiration to him, personally.

Following the attack, DeGeneres expressed her support for Smollett.

“Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show,” the talk show host said on Twitter on Wednesday. “I’m sending him and his family so much love today.”

However, the tweet raised eyebrows for some, particularly critics who remembered how strongly DeGeneres had backed Kevin Hart after he was accused of homophobia. Ellen had attempted to intervene with the Motion Picture Academy to get Hart his Oscar-hosting gig back.

“As much love as you sent Kevin Hart?” feminist author Roxane Gay replied to DeGeneres’ tweet. DeGeneres was criticized in some quarters for her aggressive backing of Hart during that controversy, which only took place about a month ago.

As much love as you sent Kevin Hart? — roxane gay (@rgay) January 30, 2019

Hart himself posted an Instagram note, one with a picture of Smollett and an expression of his support for the actor.

“Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett,” Hart wrote on his Instagram account, which has over 69 million followers. “This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards… this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

Hart, too, was criticized for the statement — according to a Yahoo News roundup — from those who noted that the sort of homophobia pushed by Hart in his old routines has the potential to lead to real-life violence, such as that reportedly suffered by Smollett.

“This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny,” journalist Ira Madison said on Twitter."

But people on Twitter weren’t having it.

The problem is that Hart has a history of making violent, homophobic comments. In tweets from 2009 to 2011, he used “gay” and “fag” pejoratively.

He also tweeted that he would hurt his son if the son wasn’t masculine enough: “Yo if my son comes home & try’s 2 play with my daughters doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice stop that’s gay.”

Hart stepped down from the Oscar hosting gig and has offered several apologies in the past month that have been criticized, both for being weak and for his concurrent criticism of LGBTQ advocates as people who “slandered” him and took away his “fun.”

People immediately pointed out that maybe Hart should acknowledge the impact his words had.

Earlier this month, Hart appeared on The Ellen Degeneres Show. He was not contrite, painting himself the victim of unfair attacks on social media.

Ellen attempted to absolve him, calling his critics “haters” and insisting he host the Oscars even though he didn’t give any indication that he understood why his comments were so harmful.

So Ellen also got some feedback when she tweeted “love” to Smollett.

Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show. I’m sending him and his family so much love today. ❤️ — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 29, 2019

On Monday night, two white men attacked Smollett in Chicago, beating him, pouring bleach on him, and tying a noose around his neck.

Smollett told police that the assailants said, “Aren’t you that faggot ‘Empire’ n*****?”

He also said that one of the attackers said, “This is MAGA country” according to the Wall Street Journal.

Chicago police have said that the FBI is helping with the investigation into the attack."

Celebrities offered their support for Smollett, while GLAAD and the NAACP released statements condemning the incident as an act of ""hate based terrorism."" Now CNN is reporting that the Chicago PD is expanding the search area of the investigation, with the hopes of finding surveillance video of his alleged attackers.

Unfortunately, so far police have only been able to find one image of Smollett in the area in which he says he was attacked. A high number of privately owned surveillance cameras were in the area, but so far they haven't been able to positively identify images of his attackers. The image they found of Smollett was from inside a Subway near the reported location of the attack, and he wasn't accompanied by anyone.

""Chicago police detectives continue to investigate serious allegations of a potential racially charged hate crime that took place in the downtown area Tuesday morning around 2 a.m.,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. ""The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras. As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders.""

As TMZ reports, Smollett spoke with police and confirmed the attackers yelled ""MAGA country"" during the attack. Smollett said that a rope was placed around his neck during the attack, and the Chicago PD have since confirmed that he still had the rope around his neck when he first contacted the cops at 2:42 a.m. in the morning.

TMZ also reported that Smollett was offered extra security by Fox while in Chicago, but declined the offer."

And it’s because they’re claiming to have never watched his TV show.

Smollett is Black and came out as gay in 2015. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the alleged attackers taunted Smollett with racist and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown substance on him (widely reported as bleach), and wrapped a rope around his neck.

Smollett told police that his attackers were wearing black clothing and ski masks. In a later interview, Smollett said that his attackers shouted “this is MAGA country” during the incident.

While Chicago police public information officer Anthony Guglielmi told the Sun-Times that the assailants made statements suggesting they knew who Smollett was, some conservatives doubt the narrative.

The veracity of the MAGA statement is unknown, but conservatives have a defense anyway. Katrina Pierson, a former Trump campaign spokesperson, tweeted her disbelief Wednesday.

“I’m still stuck on MAGA supporters who watch Empire!? Or, would know who he is? It’s befuddling – because I don’t and wouldn’t recognize him.”

Conservative commentator Bethany Mandel echoed that sentiment.

So let me get this straight: There were folks present in this area at 2am in a polar vortex. They were waiting for a gay, black man to attack. They recognized this guy from a show I've never heard of, through the hat, coat, scarf and gloves he was wearing because of the cold. — Bethany S. Mandel (@bethanyshondark) January 30, 2019

Others had a similar response.

Doesn’t this one seems bit off tho? MAGA guys watch Empire, happen to have bleach and a noose at 2am? Just feels off. — Paul S. Kemp (@Paulskemp) January 29, 2019

No witnesses, no surveillance footage in one of the busiest cities? But 2 White Racist #MAGA men watch #Empire & had supplies & new who he was? They let him live with just a scratch? Everyone's been drinking way too much Kool-Aid to believe this 💩 — Stanley James (@StanleyJames05) January 30, 2019

The defense of “we don’t watch Empire” is telling. Empire is a show predominantly about Black experience and proudly boasting that people with your political affiliation are ignorant of one of the most popular shows on television reveals the cultural biases that permeate MAGA types.

Empire is filmed in Chicago; since its debut in 2015, the show has received critical praise. While viewership has dropped, its first two seasons were hugely popular—it was the fifth most-watched show on television in those first two seasons.

Smollett plays the son of the two main characters, Lucious and Cookie Lyon, and is himself a major character on the show.

The FBI is investigating a suspicious letter also sent to Fox about Smollett, containing threatening, racist language, and a white powdery substance, according to the Sun-Times.

The Daily Dot reached out to Chicago police for an update but did not receive a response by press time.

The Fox show’s production schedule remains “fluid” for the rest of the week, according to the source. It is not yet known how Smollett’s injuries will ultimately impact production on the current season, which would typically wrap in March.

A representative for Fox declined to comment on production of “Empire.”

The attack on the actor, which is being characterized as a possible hate crime, involved two men yelling out “racial and homophobic slurs” at Smollett, pouring an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapping a rope around his neck, according to the Chicago Police Department.

According to ABC News, an earlier threat had been made in letter form to Smollett prior to Tuesday, and the investigation has now been handed over to the FBI.

“Empire” executive producer Brian Grazer said he was “disgusted and saddened by the attack on Jussie.”

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our ‘Empire’ family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement.

The NFL said in a statement on Tuesday, that the group, which will give the Super Bowl LIII halftime performance, won’t be holding the press conference as acts normally do

“Maroon 5 has been working hard on a Pepsi Super Bowl LIII Halftime Show that will meet and exceed the standards of this event,” the statement reads. “As it is about music, the artists will let their show do the talking as they prepare to take the stage this Sunday.”

The lineup for the performance at Atlanta’s Mercedes Benz Stadium will feature Maroon 5 along with Travis Scott and Atlanta native Big Boi, one half of the iconic hip-hop duo Outkast.

A Change.org petition from fans asked that Maroon 5 drop out of the lineup to side with Kaepernick who is battling against the league for being blackballed for his stance on protesting police brutality of blacks and racial injustice.

Billboard reported that Scott required the NFL to make a joint donation of $500,000 to Dream Corps, an organization fighting for social justice in order for him to move forward with the appearance. News of Scott’s being on the halftime show was initially met with anger from Michael B. Jordan, the Rev. Al Sharpton and others.

Maroon 5, is expected to continue a ‘social and digital media rollout’ ahead of Sunday night’s game, the outlet reports.

On Tuesday, the group announced a joint charity donation with Interscope Records and the NFL of $500,000 to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, according to reports.

“This is definitely a controversial year, but it’s something I’ve wanted to do my whole life. As musician it’s the biggest stage you could ever play,” the group’s keyboardist PJ Morton, said recently in an interview with The Associated Press.

“Our job as musicians is to provide a service and make people feel good, and I think that’s going to be our mission – just to have a good time and do what we do,” he added. “I’m excited to play on that stage, man. I watched halftime shows my whole life. I want to be there.”"

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Smollett was exiting a restaurant when two men approached him. The Chicago Police Department reported they “gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him.” They then proceeded to attack Smollett, pouring an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapping a rope around his neck.

The Hollywood Reporter reported later in the day that Smollett said his attackers yelled “MAGA” or “Make America great again” statements during the incident — a reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Smollett was born to a Jewish father and African-American mother. He portrays a gay musician on “Empire” named Jamal Lyon. In 2015, Smollett came out as gay, telling Ellen DeGeneres, “I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is, without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in.”

In addition to “Empire,” he has appeared in the films “Alien: Covenant” and “Marshall.”

Many users expressed their outrage at the attack on social media.

“This reported attack on Jussie is a disturbing reminder of the terrible homophobia and racism that plagues our society,” Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. “We call on police to investigate this vile incident as a hate crime and work swiftly to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice.”

Jewish comedian Dan Levy, known for his role on the popular sitcom “Schitt’s Creek,” tweeted, “Horrifying, heartbreaking, and deeply disturbing. Combat this hate by donating to a Black/LGBTQ organization today.”

“Empire” co-creator Danny Strong also spoke out, tweeting: “The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live. Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

Smollett is reportedly in good condition at the hospital. Authorities are asking witnesses to come forward and help the investigation into the attack."

The department said in a news release late Tuesday that detectives reviewed footage from privately-owned cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked and will broaden their search by reviewing footage from traffic cameras and public bus cameras.

Smollett told police he was walking downtown near the Chicago River at around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an “unknown substance” on him and put a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

“Smollett, 36, was walking on the 300 block of E. North Lower Water Street when two men approached him and ‘gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,’ Guglielmi says in a statement.

“Two unknown offenders — it is unknown if they were male or female — then attacked Smollett, hitting him in the face and then poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital, where the incident was reported to police, according to CBS Chicago.

There was plenty of condemnation to go around, particularly after TMZ reported that the attackers had shouted “this is MAGA country.”

Two of the outraged included black Democratic senators, who just by chance, happen to either be running for president or widely expected to be running for president.

There was one problem with this “modern-day lynching” narrative: None of that “MAGA country” stuff was originally mentioned to police and they’re having trouble corroborating the fact that the attack even happened.

“According to the victim, the offenders’ faces were concealed,” a police spokesman said, according to Reason. “We have no record indicating that (they shouted ‘MAGA’), we only have record of them shouting racial and homophobic slurs at him.”

A statement from Chicago Police confirmed that, Reason reported.

“We have no record of the ‘MAGA Country’ comment,” the statement said, according to Reason. “We have racial and homophobic comments documented.”

CNN reported that when police heard about the accusation and called the actor, he “relayed it to detectives in a supplemental interview.”

But then again, there’s some doubt as to whether the attack even happened.

In an area that has a “very high density” of surveillance cameras, according to the police spokesman’s statement, there is not a single image of an attack like the one Smollett described.

“A Chicago police spokesperson tells CNN that investigators canvassed the neighborhood where the reported attack occurred on actor Jussie Smollett and have found no still images or video from security cameras of the incident,” CNN reported.

“The only image of Smollett police obtained from security cameras was inside Subway Sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime, the actor was standing alone.”

For all I know, Smollett really was attacked by bigots who shouted the phrase “MAGA country,” and ambitious, Democratic politicians who are calling this a “a modern-day lynching” are absolutely justified.

But here’s the thing — I’m going to wait to see whether or not that’s the case, as everyone else should have.

It hasn’t even been a fortnight since the Covington Catholic incident, and the lesson we were should have taken away from that “teachable moment” — be careful dealing with stories that confirm your cultural narrative — has been lost.

No fewer than two senators with eyes on the 2020 Democratic nomination have taken this accusation as gospel because they can use it as an illustration of supposed Trump-fueled hate coursing through the country, even though no arrests have been made and the evidence is scanty.

If this turns out to be a hoax, Sens. Booker and Harris own this, as do the legion of liberals who tweeted this out without waiting for a fuller investigation.

Even if this turns out to be true, what they did was supremely irresponsible. That these two individuals are in the Senate is bad enough. Just imagine one of them in the White House, backed by a legion of people who think Donald Trump supporters are irresponsible bigots, but are willing to blame white Donald Trump supporters for a hate crime without any charges or even direct physical evidence.

It will make the Obama years look like pure reason.

Rob Elgas of WLS-TV in Chicago reported that ""when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed.""

It's one of a number of curious details that have emerged following the headline-grabbing incident.



What's the background?

Numerous media outlets ran with a Tuesday TMZ report saying the actor was beaten up after walking out of a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. by two white men wearing ski masks who asked, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before pouring bleach on him, putting a noose around his neck, and yelling, ""This is MAGA country!""

Chicago Police told TheBlaze on Wednesday morning there was ""no mention of MAGA"" in initial reports. But when detectives followed up with Smollett later on Tuesday, he recalled the offenders making those comments, and detectives completed a supplemental report.

Elgas tweeted that after investigators heard the ""MAGA country"" claim in the news they called Smollett again, after which he added that information.

Smollet's business manager reported the alleged attack, CBS News said.

USA Today offered the following background on Smollett:

Smollett, who plays gay character Jamal Lyon on ""Empire,"" joined the hit Fox show in 2015. He also starred in the 2017 film ""Marshall.""



During an appearance on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" in March 2015, Smollett came out as gay himself. He expanded upon his sexuality in an interview with Out Magazine in 2016.



""I am a gay man with an extremely open heart ... If I had to label myself, I would label myself as a gay man,"" he told the magazine at the time. ""If I fall in love down the road with a woman, I'm going to love that woman.""

What else has emerged?

According to another tweet from Elgas, ""Smollett requested responding Chicago police officers turn off their body cameras as they arrived to take his report. A spokesman says this is not uncommon when officers enter a private residence.""

Elgas added that Chicago police have a security image of Smollett alone inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime, and that cops also obtained additional video placing him at the scene of the crime.

But sources told CBS News they've seen security video of Smollett outdoors early Tuesday morning and ""nothing of an assault."" The network added that detectives have ""expanded the search area for video of the alleged assailants but haven't found any footage or witnesses."" Twelve detectives and a number of FBI agents are investigating, CBS News added.

<br>

NAACP calls out Trump

The NAACP called out President Donald Trump's ""racist and xenophobic rhetoric"" while decrying the alleged attack against Smollett.

Here's the statement from NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson:

""The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling. The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump's racist and xenophobic rhetoric. It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse. As this rhetoric continues to bleed into our everyday lives, dangerous behavior will continue to place many law-abiding individuals at risk. We pray for a full physical and mental recovery Jussie Smollett and many unnamed victims of this forum of hate based terrorism.""

So does Sharpton and Avenatti and others

Al Sharpton said Trump should speak out regarding the incident, particularly because he's the ""author and main proselytizer"" of the ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Michael Avenatti tweeted that the ""outrageous criminal conduct ... should be denounced by the WH immediately. This has no place in America. And it all starts at the top.""

Outspoken left-wing director Rob Reiner, reacting to the Smollett incident, tweeted that "" there is no question that since [Trump] has injected his hatred into the American bloodstream, we are less decent, less human, & less loving.""

The horrific attack on Jussie Smollett has no place in a decent human loving society. Homophobia existed before Trump, but there is no question that since he has injected his hatred into the American bloodstream, we are less decent,less human,& less loving. No intolerance! No DT!

Activist Amy Siskind had this to say:

Can we get anyone in the Trump orbit to condemn the 2 MAGA men who brutally attacked Jussie Smollett, a gay black man, and put his head in a noose while saying “This is MAGA country,"" so others don't feel like your silence is legitimizing hate? How about you @realDonaldTrump?

Kevin Hart Sends 'Prayers' to Jussie Smollett — But Faces Backlash in Wake of Homophobic Tweets

Kevin Hart has joined the chorus of celebrities speaking out after Jussie Smollett was the victim of an apparent violent hate crime.

The actor, 39, sent Smollett well-wishes in an Instagram post late Tuesday, encouraging the Empire star to “stand strong.”

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

“Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad,” Hart captioned a photo of Smollett, 36. “Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

However, Hart received some criticism for the message in the wake of the comedian’s past homophobic tweets that resurfaced last month and caused him to step down from hosting the Oscars. He later apologized.

A number of social media users pointed to the attack on Smollett as an example of why Hart’s past controversial jokes were widely criticized.

“This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny,” wrote TV writer Ira Madison III.

“Do you see why the jokes weren’t funny now?” wrote another Twitter user.

“This is your reminder that his jokes reflect actual attitudes that produce what happened to Jussie,” wrote another.

At around 2 a.m. local time in Chicago on Tuesday, Smollett went to the hospital after he was the victim of an apparent hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed in a statement that a member of the hit Fox show was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery,” though they did not name Smollett.

""I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now. @jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!!"" she wrote while sharing a video of Jussie's song, F.U.W.

Flanked by her attorneys, Amber Guyger, 30, appeared at the Dallas Criminal Courthouse but State District Judge Tammy Kemp did not conduct a hearing in the courtroom for Guyger’s ‘announcement’ setting. No word on what attorneys discussed during the appearance, The Dallas Morning News reported. Neither Guyger or her attorneys commented as they left the hearing, obeying a judge’s order not to publicly discuss the case.

Guyger told investigators that she had just ended a 15-hour shift when she returned in uniform to the South Side Flats apartment complex. She parked on the fourth floor, instead of the third, where she lived, according to the affidavit, possibly suggesting that she was confused or disoriented.

When she put her key in the apartment door, which was unlocked and slightly ajar, it opened, the affidavit said. Inside, the lights were off, and she saw a figure in the darkness that cast a large silhouette across the room, according to the officer’s account.

She claims she shot Jean, a 26-year-old accountant, thinking he was an intruder in her apartment.

A Texas grand jury indicted Guyger for murder in the shooting death of Jean in September. Jurors had the option to indict Guyger for murder or manslaughter or to decline an indictment.

Guyger, who was a Dallas police officer at the time of the shooting, was arrested and charged with manslaughter three days after she shot and killed unarmed Botham Jean in his apartment. She was also eventually fired.

In an effort to ensure a fair trial for Guyger, earlier this month a judge blocked attorneys from publicly sharing details about the murder case, the Morning News reports.

Kemp met with Dallas County prosecutor Jason Hermus and Guyger’s attorneys, Robert Rogers and Toby Shook, to hand down the gag order.

The judge made the decision “as a result of statements made to, and published by, the press a serious and imminent threat to the constitutional right of the defendant herein to a fair trial exists,” according to local station KXAS-TV.

Hart, who faced backlash in December after his past homophobic tweets resurfaced after he was announced as host for the Oscars, took to Twitter to show his support for Smollett, who was hospitalized following the Tuesday morning attack.

“Sending prayers your way [Jussie Smollett] ….This is unbelievably sad,” Hart wrote on both Instagram and Twitter. “Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. [What the f—] is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

Hart’s seemingly peaceful message was met with a round of criticism from others online, who pointed to Hart’s past homophobic tweets, claiming that the attack on Smollett, who came out as gay in 2015, was evidence of why Hart’s previous statements were so controversial and damaging to the LGBTQ community. Others also pointed to Hart’s 2011 statement where he stated he would “break it [his daughter’s dollhouse] over his [Hendrix’s] head” if his son came out as gay.

“This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny,” TV writer Ira Madison III tweeted in response to the attack on Smollett and Hart’s message.

“Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks,” poet Saeed Jones wrote, referencing Hart’s recent interview with the TV host to discuss his Oscar’s scandal. “Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart.”

“This is your reminder that Kevin Hart was given a publicity tour to declare that being an ally to LGBTQ folks is not his life's goal or dream and that he's done apologizing. This is your reminder that his jokes reflect actual attitudes that produce what happened to Jussie,” another person wrote.

The Tuesday attack on Smollett, which occurred as he was leaving a subway restaurant in Chicago during the early morning hours on Tuesday, is being investigated by the Chicago Police Department “as a possible hate crime.”

According to reports, the two masked men who approached the Empire actor yelled racial and homophobic slurs before assaulting him, and pouring what is believed to have been bleach on him, in addition to wrapping a rope around his neck. As they walked away, Smollett told authorities they yelled “MAGA country,” referencing Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Smollett was left with lacerations to his face and neck and was treated at a local hospital. No suspects have been identified or apprehended."

The 35-year-old actor, who is openly gay, was allegedly attacked by two people in ski masks, according to a report by TMZ. Chicago police said in a statement to The Daily Beast that the sex of the two attackers has not been confirmed. The two attackers, in addition to allegedly physically assaulting Smollett, allegedly tied a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him. Elite Daily reached out to Smollett's team and Chicago Police for comment on the attack, but did not hear back by the time of publication.

The attack, according to TMZ, occurred around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 after Smollett had arrived in Chicago from New York to film scenes for the current season of Empire. Smollett reportedly stopped by a Subway to get some food, and as he was walking home, he was reportedly approached by two white people wearing ski masks that reportedly said to him, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" They then allegedly attacked Smollett and reportedly yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" as they left the scene.

According to a statement a spokesperson for the Chicago police gave to The Daily Beast, the sex of the two attackers has not yet been confirmed. Elite Daily reached out to the Chicago police for comment on this report, but did not hear back by the time of publication.

TMZ reports that Smollett got himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he was treated. Chicago police confirmed they conducted interviews with Smollett while he was being treated, and in one of the interviews, Smollett reportedly confirmed that his attackers made the ""MAGA country"" comment. The attack reportedly occurred around 2 a.m. and Smollett contacted the police at 2:42 a.m. According to TMZ, Smollett was released from the hospital later that day.

This attack occurred eight days after Smollett reportedly received a letter that contained a death threat in the mail. In the photo obtained by TMZ, the message ""You will die black f**"" was written out in magazine clippings with his name above it. The letter also included a hand-drawn photo of what appears to be a man hanging from a tree with a noose around his neck and a gun pointed at him. The letter appears to say ""MAGA"" in the top left corner.

Chicago police are investigating this attack as a hate crime and are receiving assistance from the FBI, according to an ABC7 Chicago reporter.

Around 11 a.m. on Jan. 29, FOX (the network Empire is broadcast on) released the following statement:

We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.

TMZ reports the cast of Empire was reportedly informed of the hate crime against Smollett while they were on set and will be provided with additional armed security while they're still filming in Chicago.

Celebrities have been responding to the gut-wrenching news with words of love and support for Smollett.

Ariana Grande tweeted about the attack around 5 p.m. on Jan. 29.

""What happened to Jussie makes me really f*cking sick to my stomach,"" she said. ""I can’t believe sh*t like this is really still happening everyday. What kind of world ? Sending all of the healing energy / love I possibly can and hoping for change. What can we do ? Tell me & I’m there.""

Janelle Monáe posted an Instagram about Smollett and the sweet gesture he made for her when she opened up about her sexuality for the first time in an interview.

""THIS HATE CRIME against our brother @jussiesmollett is proof that no matter how famous you may be it still does not protect you from vicious racist homophobes !! AND It is still a risk daily to be a BLACK, OUT, and PROUD human being,"" she said in her caption.

She continued,

I am sending so much love to you Jussie. Praying for your healing. Thank you for being such an inspiration to me & soooooo mannnnny people. Thank you for inspiring us to walk in our truth. Thank you for choosing freedom over fear. I will continue to walk BOLD, BLACK, & PROUD in your honor always.

She closed off the caption by saying, ""With love from your bi/pan/free a** mothaf*cka sis. This pic is of me thanking him for sending flowers after the RS article (which gave me great anxiety btw). What a kind kind kind soul.""

The creator and host of the Keep It! podcast, Ira Madison, tweeted about the attack throughout all of Jan. 29 and also posted about it on his Instagram.

Madison, who is openly gay, tweeted, ""My heart breaks for Jussie. The hatred this country revels in is sickening.""

He expanded more on this in his Instagram caption that started off, ""What I will take from today is love for our community PERIOD. Our black LGBTQIA+ family, especially our trans sisters who don’t get nearly the attention as they continue to be killed.""

He continued,

We must hold space for them and for Jussie Smollett in our hearts and our quest for justice. Finally, MAGA is not just a hat and homophobia can no longer be tolerated in any of our communities (black, Hollywood, or otherwise). Be careful the things we say: children will listen. And learn. #JussieSmollett

Activist and writer Deray McKesson, who is also openly gay, responded to the attack against his friend on Instagram.

He posted two photos of him and Smollett laughing together and said, ""I love this man. Jussie is such a kind person and incredible friend. And I just saw him in Chicago. I don’t have a lot of words right now but #F*ckMAGA and #F*ckHomophobia.""

Zendaya reacted on both Instagram and Twitter.

""I just hope there is justice in this hateful and targeted act of violence,"" she said. ""Sending @jussiesmollett my love and wishing him a speedy recovery. We love you.""

John Legend reacted on Twitter.

""Sending love to Jussie and the Smollett family after this horrific attack,"" Legend tweeted. ""We support you and pray that you find peace and justice.""

Andy Cohen posted a justifiably heated tweet.

""THIS IS F*CKED UP TO THE CORE,"" he tweeted. ""CATCH THESE EVIL HOMOPHOBES AND LOCK THEM UP FOREVER.""

The creator of Empire, Lee Daniels, posted an emotional video to his Instagram about the attack.

“It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie, you are my son,"" Daniels said. “You didn’t deserve, nor did anybody deserve, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown you on. … You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts a home. We have to love each other.”

Billy Eichner responded on Twitter.

""This is so awful. Sending love to @JussieSmollett,"" he tweeted.

Vice President Joe Biden responded to the attack with words of support as well.

""What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country,"" he tweeted. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.""

Mindy Kaling sent Smollett love on Twitter.

""I am disgusted and horrified to hear of the homophobic and racial attack on Jussie Smollett last night,"" Kaling tweeted. ""Unfortunately, these hateful attacks happen way too often. We must call out and hold those accountable. Sending love to you, Jussie.""

Sending all of the love to Smollett as he heals."

This article was published 30/1/2019 (509 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.

CHICAGO - Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the ""persons of interest"" Wednesday evening.

Chicago police have opened a hate crime investigation after a man the department identified as a 36-year-old cast member of the television show ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù alleged he was physically attacked by men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs. Police wouldn‚Äôt release the actor‚Äôs name, but a statement from the Fox studio and network on which ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù airs identified him Tuesday, Jan. 29, 2019, as Jussie Smollett. (Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File)

Investigators ""for the most part"" can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor ""is at home and recovering.""

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.""

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

The FBI will help investigate an attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett.

The federal government agency—which has powers to intervene in serious crime investigations including hate crimes—will probe the attack, which took place in the early hours of Tuesday (January 29) in Chicago.

Out TV star Smollett, who plays a high-profile gay character on Fox show Empire, was hospitalised after the violent incident, in which he was reportedly branded a “faggot Empire n****r” and had a noose tied around his neck by two men.

FBI to assist police probe into Jussie Smollett attack

Chicago Police confirmed to ABC News that the FBI is assisting in the investigation of the brutal attack.

ThatGrapeJuice, the first outlet to report the attack, alleged that a threatening letter was sent to Smollett days before the attack that reads: “You will die black fag.”

The envelope featured the acronym ‘MAGA,’ which stands for the pro-Trump slogan “Make America Great Again.”

In a previous statement, Chicago Police said: “Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him.

“The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.

“At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

Chicago Police added: “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.

“The victim is fully cooperating with investigators and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com.”

No video of the attack has yet been found, and no arrests have been made.

Empire co-stars send support after Jussie Smollett attack

Smollett is yet to speak publicly about the incident, but many of his Empire colleagues have sent messages of support.

In an emotional video posted to Instagram, Empire co-creator Lee Daniels said: “It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because, Jussie, you are my son.

“You didn’t deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘faggot n****r’ or whatever they said to you.

“You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home.”

Daniels added: “We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows we are united on a united front and no racist f**k can come in and do the things that they did to you.

“Hold your head up, Jussie. I’m with you. I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another f***ing day in America.”

A statement on behalf of the entire Empire production adds: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night.

“We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

“The entire studio, network and production shared united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate, and especially against one of our own.”"

Terrence Howard is the latest “Empire” co-star to speak out about the attack. Sitting down with “Good Morning America”, the 49-year-old reveals that he and the rest of the “Empire” cast found out about the hate crime while on set, saying that “jaws dropped to the ground.”

“When we had learned that there had been letters that had been sent to Fox as threats about the potential of something like this, then we became much more frightened.”

The actor’s comments come less than 24 hours after Smollett, who portrays his son on “Empire”, was discharged from the hospital after suffering injuries caused by two unknown offenders who yelled out racial and homophobic slurs. The assailants battered him in his face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

At some point during the incident, one of the offenders allegedly wrapped a rope around the 35-year-old’s neck before fleeing the scene.

“I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,” Howard explains. “But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t — and we cannot — forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

“Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood,” Howard adds. “He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family — you know, the Fox family, the ‘Empire’ family, the Lyon family — were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.”

“I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now. @jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!!,” Henson wrote in her post.

“I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know,” she added."

Smollett told police he was walking downtown near the Chicago River at around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an “unknown substance” on him and put a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

On Tuesday, Empire actor Jussie Smollett reported being assaulted in Chicago by two white men in ski masks. The brutal attack, which Smollett told Chicago Police included racial and homophobic slurs (as reported by TMZ), a noose, and the attackers yelling “this is MAGA country,” came as a shock to many. Celebrities, social justice advocates, among many others, voiced their horror on social media and gave messages of support to Smollett, who was released from the hospital later that day.

Advertisement

But as stories of the attack spread on social media, its users noted—and recoiled—at the way it was being described:

“A possible hate crime.” A “homophobic” attack, but not a “racist” one. “Racially charged.”

Advertisement

Some of it was bucking at old media industry conventions that sounded particularly galling and abrasive, given the severity of what Smollet said happened to him. Others noted news outlets’ repeated—and problematic—reluctance to describe things as “racist” had reared its head yet again.

An important thing to note here is that news outlets have a lot more discretion to describe an event as “racist” or “homophobic” than we do “possible” or “alleged.”

In the Smollett case, “possible hate crime” comes directly from the police assessment of the situation—a hate crime is a specific charge that meets a specific legal standard, and Chicago Police hadn’t levied those charges yet. And news publications, despite what its reporters might think of a specific case or situation, have to at least mention how police are describing and assessing it. Often times, we defer entirely to it.

Advertisement

There is certainly an argument to be made, and a separate discussion to be had, about whether these media conventions grant too much power to the state and its evaluation of an incident or event.

As a journalist, I look at the words like “alleged” or “suspected” as a blanket industry standard that can come up distressingly short, depending on the context. Hanging over each usage of these words is 1) the knowledge that yes, slipping up on the wrong story can get your ass sued, and 2) “alleged”—particularly when applied to a justice system that frequently dismisses charges or acquits people of crimes—is, many times, useful and necessary. Hoaxes exist. Stories and witness accounts change or are recanted altogether.



Advertisement

Where news outlets have a lot more discretion is how they describe a situation. We have the power to call a thing racist. Frequently, publications don’t—even when it’s the right word to use.

The Smollett case, in which several prominent news organizations felt comfortable calling the attack “homophobic” but not “racist” highlighted this collective reticence.

Advertisement

Here’s a screenshot from the Los Angeles Times Newsletter, “Today’s Headlines” from Tuesday:

Advertisement

Then there’s Entertainment Tonight’s tweet from Monday—one of the most widely shared versions of the story—in which the outlet describes the possible attack as “homophobic and racially charged.”

Advertisement

A subsequent tweet used stronger language—though the language was actually Daniels’.

Advertisement

TMZ, one of the first outlets to report the story, referred to the attack as homophobic, but entirely omitted calling it racist or racially motivated in the headline.

Advertisement

This was also true of the NBC News’ headline that ran on social media, though the headline on the site read differently (note: it’s not unusual for the social media headline to differ from the one that runs on the site).



Advertisement

Many outlets refrained from labeling the attack one way or another, referring to it as a possible hate crime and then describing different elements of the police report, including the use of racial and homophobic slurs and the presence of a noose, which Smollett says was slipped over his head at one point during the attack.

It’s that last point that continues to send chills down my spine—suggesting, among other things, the attack may have been premeditated. But it’s startling that prominent news outlets could feel comfortable with labeling an attack “homophobic” while watering down or altogether side-stepping its obviously racist elements.

Advertisement

It’s an ongoing problem with media, and one that’s particularly glaring at mainstream outlets, which substitute toothless phrases like “racially charged” or “racially tinged” for the word “racist”—a word that some people would have you believe is a slur itself, rather than an objective (and demonstrable) descriptor of words, behaviors, or policies.

Some of those people write news. Some of them run entire sites. And this plays into a news outlet’s comfort with labeling an incident “racist.” Specifically, the fear that the word will distract from the story, or will alienate the audience; that it doesn’t fit a standard for “objectivity” or “neutrality”—as if those standards weren’t subjective calculations made on the part of news editors and news writers themselves.

Advertisement

In doing so, news outlets reinforce the idea that “racist” is a dirty word, rather than a matter of accurately describing the implications and effects of something. We subtly reinforce the idea that in order to call a thing racist, we must divine the subject’s intent and feeling—making racism a matter of racial animus (that is, an assessment of one’s personal goodness) rather than one of material consequence.

Of course, anyone who’s actually experienced racism knows better.

Which brings us back to Jussie Smollett, a gay black man who appears to have been targeted and attacked precisely because of those two qualities. An attack in which he says his assailants called him a “faggot” and “nigger,” poured bleach on him, and then slipped a noose around his neck.

Advertisement

It shouldn’t be lost on anyone that there is no greater symbol of American racism than the noose, an inanimate object representing hundreds of years of lynching—of systematic, rampant racial hatred, violence, and death.



If you can’t describe that aspect of Smollett’s attack as racist, then pray tell, what can you call racist ?

Chicago police announced they have located surveillance video showing potential persons of interest in an alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor and singer Jussie Smollett.

Investigators are looking to question the men seen in the video, which was found Wednesday, Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi announced on Twitter.

A Chicago Police spokesperson told ABC News the video shows two people walking in the general area of where Smollett was at the time of the attack. The video does not show the assault, the spokesperson said.

The department sent out an alert out to the community asking if the public recognizes the two unknown people, but the quality of the video is not great, the spokesperson said.

Police are continuing to investigate and search for the two men allegedly involved in what they call ""a potential racially-charged hate crime"" against Smollett.

The brutal attack against the ""Empire"" star took place around 2 a.m. Tuesday and the 36-year-old actor was subsequently hospitalized and released, local authorities said. Smollett has been cooperating with local authorities to find the men he says attacked him, shouting racial and homophobic slurs at him in the process.

In addition to being attacked, Smollett told police Tuesday that the men also poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck. The rope was still around Smollett's neck when he was found, officials said.

""As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront, hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders,"" a Chicago Police Department spokesperson told ABC News early Wednesday.

""Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect's vehicle to be able to share.""

""We are taking this investigation very seriously and detective teams will broaden our search area and work around the clock to look for video on traffic cameras, CTA buses and neighboring thoroughfares which could have captured the offender's movements,"" the police spokesperson added, referring to the Chicago Transit Authority. ""The victim in this case is cooperating fully with detectives and our investigation continues.""

On Tuesday, an earlier alleged threat to Smollett, in the form of a letter, drawing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into a probe of the letter threat, the spokesman confirmed to ABC News.

As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront, hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders.

The letter allegedly threatening Smollett before the attack was sent to the Fox television studio in Chicago on Jan. 22, police said. The letter contained threatening language and was laced with a powdery substance that investigators believe was likely just crushed-up Tylenol.

Smollett’s music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, told ABC News that he was on the phone with Smollett when he was attacked. Moore said he heard the words ""MAGA country"" being used.

""I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur.""

Chicago Police told ABC News that they spoke with Moore, and that his account is noted in the police report, though they have not yet confirmed it with phone records. They added that both Smollett and Moore told them they were on the phone together.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday, ""Empire"" co-star Terrence Howard said a production manager notified the cast about the attack in a meeting on set Tuesday.

""Jaws dropped to the ground,"" Howard said, recalling the emergency cast meeting. ""And then when we learned that there had been letters sent to Fox as threats about the potential for something like this and then we became much more frightened.""

""As far as I know, for 17 hours a day, Jussie Smollett is my son,"" Howard said. ""So you're feeling this helplessness, this hopelessness that your children -- the people that you love -- aren't safe,"" he added.

The actor said Fox boosted security on set in the wake of the incident and offered each cast member 24-hour personal security.

As far as I know, for 17 hours a day, Jussie Smollett is my son. So you're feeling this helplessness, this hopelessness that your children -- the people that you love -- aren't aren't safe.

""It was offered up today that we could have 24-hour security. Someone parked in front of our house during the evening, someone to drive us, or to follow us to and from work,"" Howard told ""GMA.""

Other members of the ""Empire"" family like creator Lee Daniels and co-star Vivica A. Fox spoke out in disgust over the attack and said they will be right by his side.

Smollett's ""Empire"" character, Jamal, is the son of a hip-hop mogul who initially has trouble accepting that Jamal is gay.

After hitting it big in ""Empire,"" Smollett said he likes to stay away from talking about his personal life, but he did. make reference to his sexual identify -- which has prompted industry chatter.

""There's never been a closet that I've been in,"" he said. ""There is, without a doubt, no closet that I've ever been in, and I just wanted to make that clear.""

In previous interviews, Smollett wouldn't talk about his sexuality but did say fans and others shouldn't try to fit him into any box.

CHICAGO -- Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the ""persons of interest"" Wednesday evening.

Investigators ""for the most part"" can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor ""is at home and recovering.""

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.""

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

Jan. 30 (UPI) -- Halle Berry, Michael B. Jordan and the cast of Empire are among celebrities voicing support for actor Jussie Smollett and outrage over his attack on a Chicago street in an apparent hate crime.

Smollett, 35, who stars as Jamal Lyon on Fox's Empire, is recovering after he was attacked on Tuesday by two unknown men in what was a homophobic and racially-charged incident in Chicago.

The Chicago Police Department said that the television star was walking down a street when he was approached by the men who yelled out racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett was attacked about the face and the men also poured a chemical substance onto him and tied a rope around his neck.

""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,"" 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.

Lee Daniels, the co-creator of Empire, posted his thoughts in a video on Instagram. ""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck,"" he said. ""You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that. It starts at home, it starts at home yo.""

Empire star Gabourey Sidibe uploaded a music video Smollett made that touches on racism, immigration and the 2016 presidential election.

""This despicable act only shamefully reveals how deeply the diseases of hatred, inequality, racism and discrimination continue to course through our country's veins,"" Empire star Lady Grace Byers said alongside a photo of herself with Smollett.

""Your light will continue to shine bright, which is the part these disgusting people fail to realize. I hope you make a speedy recovery and continue to educate, motivate, and inspire millions. Love you big bro,"" Empire star Serayah said next to a photo of herself standing alongside Smollett.

Steve Harvey offered his support in the form of a video. ""As a black man in this country, I'm down with you. I know a lot of brothers that's down with you. This ain't about sexual preference or nothing. This is about coming to the aid of another brother that has tasted the brutality of hatred, racism, and bigotry.""

Here we go again. If you think the manure-spreaders of sensationalism who masquerade as ethical practitioners of journalism learned anything from last week's MAGA-bashing Covington Catholic High School hoax, I have three words for you:

Ha, ha, ha.

On Tuesday morning, uncorroborated claims by actor Jussie Smollett that he was the victim of a ""brutal"" hate crime by Trump supporters in Chicago went viral across social media. Entertainment rag TMZ.com first splashed ""exclusive"" headlines that the ""Empire"" cast member was ""beaten by MAGA backers"" in a ""homophobic attack"" at around 2 a.m. in Chicago. If you have no idea what ""Empire"" is or who Smollett is, join the club. The TV star is apparently a vocal critic of Trump and attacked ""45 and all his white hooded cohorts"" on Instagram last week.

But I digress.

Within minutes, the gossip site's squib on the TV star's alleged victimization trended on Twitter and rocketed up to USA Today, Variety, CBS, CNN and The New York Times. The Fishwrap of Record breathlessly reported lurid details of two people who ""wrapped rope around his neck,"" which multiple outlets characterized as a ""noose."" A police statement providing incident background stated that ""the offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,"" according to Smollett. Multiple websites reported that the substance was bleach.

This is truly horrible, if true. But color me cautious and skeptical. TMZ initially reported that Smollett had exited a Subway chain restaurant near his luxury apartment when accosted by the racist, homophobic assailants, who allegedly recognized him from his work on ""Empire."" Allegedly, Smollett received a hate mail with the word ""MAGA"" on it addressed to him and sent to his studio in Chicago last week. If this was a premeditated attack, the FBI should get to the bottom of it.

But oddities and discrepancies abound:

TMZ quoted one of the ""MAGA country"" attackers who allegedly hurled epithets at Smollett: ""Aren't you that f——t 'Empire' n—— ?""

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces wander around the upscale Streeterville neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about ""MAGA country""?

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces have ever heard of ""Empire,"" could recognize Jussie Smollett, or know or care anything about his sexuality?

Despite TMZ's claim that Smollett had the ""hell beat outta him"" and attackers ""broke his ribs"" plus subjected him to a chemical attack, an ambulance was not called and he instead ""self-transported"" to the hospital. CWB Chicago, a local public safety watchdog site, reported on police dispatch records documenting that Smollett's friend ""Frank"" refused EMS services for Smollett; no mention of bleach was made; ""no or minor injury"" was observed; and ""officers never sent a 'flash; message with offender descriptions to field units.""

Weird.

Another assertion not included in the CPD's initial press release on the incident: Any mention of ""MAGA supporters"" or any mention of the race of the alleged assailants. Police clarified that they had not received any official information backing TMZ reporter Charles Latibeaudiere's claim, which he attributed to sources close to Smollett, that the alleged attackers shouted, ""This is MAGA country.""

Nor had the police corroborated that the attackers were white, since Smollett had told them their faces and hands were both covered. After launching a search for surveillance video and potential witnesses, the police department reported late Tuesday that ""thus far we have not found anything to be able to put out a description.""

I was told that public records requests for the incident report may take ""weeks"" to be approved. I was also told the Chicago police remain in charge of investigating the alleged incident, while the FBI probe of the alleged hate mail remains separate

CPD's public information office also told me late Tuesday that when police responded to the 911 call regarding the incident, Smollett gave them no details about where it occurred or what the attackers looked like. None. They were reportedly on scene for an hour with Smollett. When I asked again how the claims about white ""MAGA attackers"" were disseminated in the press, the PIO replied:

""We have no idea where that came from.""

Minutes after I hung up the phone with her, a local Chicago reporter tweeted that Smollett did mention the ""MAGA"" angle in a ""follow-up, supplemental interview."" Which is it?

Despite all the holes, contradictions and unanswered questions, the MAGA hate crime narrative has already calcified. (Sound familiar?) By 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, a search for ""MAGA"" and ""Smollett"" on Google yielded 3,520,000 results. And TMZ ended its day of social justice pot-stirring with the Rev. Al Sharpton calling for President Donald Trump to ""denounce Jussie Smollett's MAGA attackers"" who have yet to be identified.

Classic manufactured ""news:"" Report on an uncorroborated hate crime. Plant unverified details. Repeatedly blame white male Trump supporters. Stoke Hollywood outrage. Enlist the godfather of hate crime hoaxes to call on the president to denounce phantom attackers. Reap clicks and publicity. Indict all skeptics as racists and haters. Repeat.

Smears first. Facts later. How much deader can American journalism get?

CHICAGO — Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of footage from downtown surveillance cameras but haven’t found footage yet of the alleged attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.

The department said in a news release late Tuesday that detectives reviewed footage from privately-owned cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked and will broaden their search by reviewing footage from traffic cameras and public bus cameras.

Smollett told police he was walking downtown near the Chicago River at around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an “unknown substance” on him and put a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

While Kevin Hart was just trying to show love and support to Jussie Smollett who was recently brutally attacked, the comedian got dragged on social media and was labeled a hypocrite for it.

As we reported on Tuesday, the “Empire” star was attacked outside his Chicago apartment by two men who put a noose around his neck and hurled bigoted slurs while dousing him with an “unknown chemical substance.” Hart along with many other celebrities sent well wishes to Smollett. Hart wrote,

“Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world????,” Kevin Hart wrote. “Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

Apparently, some people didn’t appreciate Hart’s words about Smollett because they are still upset with him over the homophobic comments he’s made in the past. One user wrote,

“You were just throwing hissy fits about not being able to make homophobic jokes. You’re a trash piece of sh*t and this is disrespectful honestly,” The Blast quotes. Another tweeted, “Where’s Kevin Hart and DL Hughley with some more of their little homophobic jokes? Since it’s all just funny and accountability isn’t important.”

Smollett was taken to a local hospital where he was treated for his injuries. The Chicago Police Department is now investigating the incident as a “possible hate crime.”

The response to the attack has been a mix of shock, sadness, heartbreak, and outrage, with a number of celebrities, activists, and other public figures speaking out in support of Smollett, who has since been released from this hospital.

Among the calls for love and tolerance was none other than… Kevin Hart?

In an Instagram post, Hart called the incident “unbelievably sad” and decried society going “backwards.”

“This is unbelievably sad,” he wrote. “Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world????”

He continued: “Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother”

Jussie Smollett, star of the critically acclaimed TV show Empire, was brutally attacked around 2 a.m. on Tuesday (Jan. 29) in Chicago. In the wake of the tragic news, stars – from John Legend to Olivia Munn, Ellen DeGeneres and Reese Witherspoon – have taken to social media to send their love and support to the actor.

The 35-year-old actor was attacked by two men in ski masks, TMZ reported, who recognized Jussie from the popular show. According to a statement from the Chicago Police Department shared on Twitter, the incident is being investigated as a hate crime. The star was taken to the hospital, and well-wishes for the award-winning actor came flooding in.

Chrissy Teigen's husband John was one of the first to reach out on Twitter, writing his family supports him and prays ""that you find peace and justice.""

CHICAGO - Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the ""persons of interest"" Wednesday evening.

Chicago police have opened a hate crime investigation after a man the department identified as a 36-year-old cast member of the television show ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù alleged he was physically attacked by men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs. Police wouldn‚Äôt release the actor‚Äôs name, but a statement from the Fox studio and network on which ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù airs identified him Tuesday, Jan. 29, 2019, as Jussie Smollett. (Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File)

Investigators ""for the most part"" can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor ""is at home and recovering.""

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

(Courtesy of Chicago Police Department via AP)

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.""

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

The attackers fled before inflicting serious harm, and Smollett was able to walk to the nearby Northwestern hospital for treatment.

In a statement, the Chicago PD said they were “treating [the attack] as a possible hate crime” and have asked for anyone with information on the attackers to come forward. As of Wednesday morning, police still did not have enough information to put out a description of the attackers, who were reportedly wearing masks at the time of the attack. The attackers also supposedly yelled that Smollett was in “MAGA country” during the attack, alluding to President Donald Trump‘s campaign slogan.

After hearing the news, a number of stars showed their support for Smollett on social media. In an emotional video, Empire’s co-creator Lee Daniels called Smollett his “son” and told him to “hold your head up.”

Fellow actors Chadwick Boseman and Matt Bomer also tweeted their support, with Bomer reassuring Smollett that his attackers “will be brought to justice.”

Smollett was exiting a restaurant when two men approached him. The Chicago Police Department reported they “gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him.” They then proceeded to attack Smollett, pouring an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapping a rope around his neck.

The Hollywood Reporter reported later in the day that Smollett said his attackers yelled “MAGA” or “Make America great again” statements during the incident — a reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Smollett was born to a Jewish father and African-American mother. He portrays a gay musician on “Empire” named Jamal Lyon. In 2015, Smollett came out as gay, telling Ellen DeGeneres, “I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is, without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in.”

In addition to “Empire,” he has appeared in the films “Alien: Covenant” and “Marshall.”

Many users expressed their outrage at the attack on social media.

“This reported attack on Jussie is a disturbing reminder of the terrible homophobia and racism that plagues our society,” Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. “We call on police to investigate this vile incident as a hate crime and work swiftly to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice.”

Jewish comedian Dan Levy, known for his role on the popular sitcom “Schitt’s Creek,” tweeted, “Horrifying, heartbreaking, and deeply disturbing. Combat this hate by donating to a Black/LGBTQ organization today.”

“Empire” co-creator Danny Strong also spoke out, tweeting: “The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live. Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

Smollett is reportedly in good condition at the hospital. Authorities are asking witnesses to come forward and help the investigation into the attack."

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing."

The department said in a news release late Tuesday that detectives reviewed footage from privately-owned cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked and will broaden their search by reviewing footage from traffic cameras and public bus cameras.

Smollett told police he was walking downtown near the Chicago River at around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an “unknown substance” on him and put a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

“Empire” is shot in Chicago and is currently in production.

Fans of Fox’s hit series Empire will remember the dramatic moment Jussie Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, came out as gay.

It was episode eight of season one back in 2015 and Jamal was delivering a performance of his debut single You’re So Beautiful.

Who can forget how the face of his father, Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard), slowly dropped as he heard Jussie defiantly singing the lyrics: ‘This is the kind of song that makes a man love a man.’

Lucious’ reaction was the realisation, or more the coming to terms, with his son’s sexality which he’d really known the truth of all along.

It was an incredibly powerful moment, particularly for a primetime US TV show featuring predominantly black characters.

This makes it even more poignant that Jussie, 34, was horrifically beaten this week in an attack that was homophobic and racially-aggravated.

Unfortunately, all the bravery of Jussie’s character Jamal in that empowering moment was reduced to ignorance in another.

At the time of Jamal’s coming out, Empire was one of the highest-rated shows on TV and that particular episode had attracted a staggering 13.9 million viewers.

Reactions to that scene in season one were overwhelming:

One of the best coming out I've seen on TV is Jamal Lyon coming out. Best one ever. — mаrine⚘ (@purplekihyun) December 7, 2016

@EmpireFOX 's Jamal Lyon coming out to the entire world in a re-written hip hop song in front of his homophobic father is my favorite thing. — Hermione Knope (@earthbyapril) March 13, 2015

Jamal Lyon coming out on Empire was like the biggest YAS girl moment of my life! — Kat ✨ (@kclark874) November 18, 2016

I'ma let y'all finish, but Jamal Lyon had the best coming out ever. #Empire — Charisse ✊? (@Scandalous49) February 26, 2015

The coming out scene had a major impact culturally and for Jussie himself as the storyline prompted him to confirm his own sexuality that same year while promoting the series.

During an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Jussie said: ‘It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet.

‘There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in. I don’t own a closet, I got dressed, but I don’t have a closet… I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home.’

While Jussie has always been openly gay, he does appreciate the impact of Jamal’s story.

In an interview with Pride Source, Jussie said: ‘It really humbles me. And it makes me grateful. I just remember that there was nobody I could see on TV who I could identify with.

‘The very first person that I ever saw who was gay at all, like any member of the LGBTQ community that I could somewhat identify with, was Wilson Cruz (as Rickie Vasquez) on My So-Called Life.’

The actor was hailed a ‘true champion’ by GLAAD for his work in the LGBTQ community (Picture: Getty Images)

The actor continued: ‘He was someone of colour, and I grew up loving people like Elton John, but I couldn’t identify with Elton John because that’s all I saw. I didn’t put two and two together – it wasn’t representation. I loved George Michael growing up. I loved Boy George growing up.

‘But I didn’t connect. And maybe I would’ve been able to connect more on that level had I seen more people who represented me on that level.’

Over the past four years, Jussie’s had the full support of his Empire co-stars in regards to Jamal’s journey and his own.

Recalling what his on-screen mum, Taraji P Henson, once said about him being gay, Jussie revealed: ‘She said, “Who gives a fuck? I don’t tell these motherfuckers that I’m straight. Why the fuck do you have to tell them that you’re gay?”

‘That was so O.G., and it just made me love her even more.’

In the wake of the hate crime against him, GLAAD hailed Jussie a ‘champion’ in honour of his influence on the LGBTQ community.

They said in a statement: ‘Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.’

And that speaks volumes way more than the hideous actions of others.

In a statement to PEOPLE, Chicago Police confirmed that the victim — who has not been officially identified as Smollett — remembered his attackers calling out the “Make America Great Again” abbreviation.

“In the initial reports there was no mention of MAGA,” the statement read. “When detectives [followed] up with him later in the day, he recalled the offenders making those comments and detectives completed a supplemental report.”

The statement continued, saying that “detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators.”

Chicago Police spokesperson, Anthony Guglielmi, told the Chicago Sun-Times that the attackers specifically yelled, “This is MAGA country.” TMZ first reported that Smollett’s attackers allegedly yelled the statement.

Quoting Guglielmi, the Sun-Times reported that Smollett, 35, flew from New York to Chicago on Monday to film the next season of the hit Fox show. Smollett went to get a late-night meal Tuesday and was walking back to his temporary apartment when the attack occurred.

Around 2 a.m. local time, two people walked up to the victim while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, and then they began to beat him with their hands around his face and poured a chemical substance on his neck, Chicago P.D. confirmed in a statement to PEOPLE, which did not name Smollett. The offenders also wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene. A Chicago P.D. spokesperson previously told PEOPLE Smollett believed the substance to be bleach.

The Sun-Times reported that Guglielmi said Smollett did not initially want to tell police what happened because of his high-profile career, but his manager finally called 911 around 2:45 a.m. local time. According to the Sun-Times, when police showed up to speak to Smollett, he still had a “thin, light rope” around his neck. Guglielmi added to the outlet that it didn’t necessarily resemble a noose.

The Sun-Times reported that officers, who turned off their body cams for the interview per Smollett’s request, then told him to go to the hospital for his face and neck cuts. Smollett was released from the hospital later in the day on Tuesday.

Officer Guglielmi told PEOPLE in a Wednesday statement that detectives are continuing the investigation, and noted that “as of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders. Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect’s vehicle to be able to share.”

“We are taking this investigation very seriously and detective teams will broaden our search area and work around the clock to look for video on traffic cameras, CTA buses and neighboring thoroughfares which could have captured the offender’s movements,” said the statement. “The victim in this case is cooperating fully with detectives and our investigation continues.”

As of Tuesday morning, Smollett was in “good in condition,” according to a statement from Chicago P.D.

Smollett’s reps did not respond to PEOPLE’s previous requests for comment.

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement about the attack on Tuesday, saying: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face or any despicable act of violence and hatred — and especially against one of our own.”

Smollet’s next-door neighbor, Steven Down, previously told PEOPLE he was upset to hear about what happened. “He’s always been a very friendly, outgoing, warm and personable neighbor,” he said. “I was shocked when I read the news. I did send my message to him personally but I haven’t heard from him or spoken with him. My thoughts are with him.”

In a statement about the attack to PEOPLE, GLAAD said it reached out to Fox and Smollett’s team to offer assistance.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” the statement read.

And Eliza Byard, executive director of GLSEN, further spoke to his contributions to the gay community.

“It’s really awful. It’s shocking, it is deeply saddening. But unfortunately it is of a piece with trends we see in the country right now,” Byard said. “My main concern at this moment is of course that Jussie have all the support to make a full recovery but that also LGBTQ youth across the country, particularly black LGBTQ youth know, that there is a community out there ready to support and protect them. Jussie is a member of our GLSEN family and he’s such an important figure for LGBTQ youth everywhere. I know him as a beacon for young people. The larger context here is that racism and homophobia are deep legacies that our society has to wrestle with and we have far to go.”

The openly gay Empire actor was hit in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him, and a rope wrapped around his neck. He reportedly suffered a broken rib and other injuries and was taken to a hospital where he was released later that day.

Smollett is recovering and in ""good condition"" but it's unclear whether or not he will return to filming the Fox musical drama, where he plays Jamal Lyon. According to Deadline, the series will not continue its filming schedule for the time-being and will be ""going dark Wednesday"" — along with the Fox's new series Proven Innocent, which is also shot in Chicago — due to both the attack and the frigid weather conditions hitting the Midwest.

Deadline also reported that counselors and a SAG-AFTRA representative were made available on the set of Empire to speak with and comfort the cast and crew. They will remain available as long as they are needed.

Shooting would typically wrap in March but future production is up in the air as Smollett heals.

After news of the ""possible hate crime"" broke, Hollywood and Smollett's Empire team reacted spoke out on social media. “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our ‘Empire’ family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment wrote in a statement.

The show's co-creator Lee Daniels said, “Jussie you are my son. You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserve to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die f—–, n—–,’ or whatever they said to you. You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that.""

CHICAGO (AP) — Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

Concert Still On Following Brutal Attack As ‘Empire’ Halts Production

The show must go on for Empire star Jussie Smollett.

The actor was hospitalized on Tuesday after being brutally attacked in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime. Smollett has since been discharged, but the truly awful Chicago incident sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry and the rest of the world.

Despite the horrific attack, the actor and musician’s show at the Troubadour in West Hollywood is still set for this Saturday, with no reported plans to cancel.

Per ET reports, the Los Angeles venue confirmed that their calendar, including Jussie’s slated performance, is up to date. A rep named Paul Kacick of the concert booking company Sean Healy Presents confirmed that it’s business as usual for now, and ticket holders would be notified if anything changes:

“We’re going on with the show as far as we know, until we hear anything different.”

Wow. Kind of shocking to hear after such a terrible incident. Hopefully security is tight for the show, if it truly still happens. And since it’s still a few days away, it leaves room for cancellation if the singer isn’t quite ready to hit the stage again.

On another note, production for Empire has been temporarily shut down for a reason completely unrelated to the attack, as the cast and crew battle severe weather conditions on location in Chicago.

Still though, the actor has received an outpour of love and support from his on-screen family, as many have posted heart-felt messages on social media. As we reported, FOX has stepped up security with armed guards for members of production after a threatening letter containing homophobic slurs was sent to Smollett just last week. The letter is being investigated in connection to the assault.

A Chicago PD spokesperson named Anthony Gugliemi continues to post updates on the investigation on Twitter, with this latest confirming that police have “expanded the search area for cameras to be able to provide photos of the alleged assailants in this attack.”

Hopefully the authorities are able to catch the assailants, and get justice for Jussie.

According to reports, Smollett was in Chicago, Illinois earlier this week when he was attacked by two masked men who beat him, poured bleach on him, and tied a noose around his neck.

Howard — who plays the father of Smollett's character on the Fox drama — has since opened up about the attack and shared how his on-screen son is doing in the wake of the violent crime.

“I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,” Howard told Good Morning America. “But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

“Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood,” he went on to say. “He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family — you know, the Fox family, the Empire family, the Lyon family — were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.”

The Chicago Police Department is currently investigating the crime, which they have cited as being “racially-charged assault and battery,” per PEOPLE.

“A 36 year old man was walking … when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” a statement from the CPD read. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

Kamala Harris, including Michael Avenatti, who once thought he was going to be president. But after Stormy Daniels‘ lawyer tweeted that it will be difficult for the U.S. senator from California to be elected to the nation’s highest public office, he was doing some explaining.

“Unfortunately, because of Willie Horton, it is very very difficult for a former prosecutor to be elected President,” Avenatti wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “All it takes is one bad plea deal, where the defendant then later committed a violent crime, and the campaign is over. And almost every prosecutor has at least one.”

And almost every prosecutor has at least one. — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) January 29, 2019

He continued, “And if Senator Harris is aware of any such plea deal gone bad, her campaign should try and get out in front of it now, disclose it, explain it, and try and move forward. Because I can promise you that journalists and the Repubs will find it. And then it will be too late.”

Willie Horton was a person used in a racist attack ad by Republican candidate George H. W. Bush in 1988. It framed his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, as being weak on crime because he supported weekend passes for prisoners. Horton committed a crime while on a weekend pass. The infamous ad ruined Dukakis campaign and helped Bush become president.

Avenatti expanded more on his tweets to Salon.com, “I worked on over 150 campaigns in 42 states — Senate races, gubernatorial races, etc. — and whenever we were running against a prosecutor, we were generally elated, because every prosecutor has at least one if not many plea deals that have gone bad.”

He added, “It is easy to exploit a situation like that in the political arena, and especially at this level, when running for the presidency of the United States. The likelihood of journalists and/or opponents — whether they be in the primary or otherwise — digging into her prosecutorial background and locating such a plea deal gone wrong is extremely high.”

The true motivation behind Avenatti’s tweets might be found in an article TIME published in October quoting the lawyer insisting that he didn’t want a Black person to run for president. When asked who he wanted to see as the Democratic Party’s nominee in 2020, Avenatti’s answer was deliberate: “I think it better be a white male,” he said before adding later: “When you have a white male making the arguments, they carry more weight.”

There have been questions about Harris’ history as it relates to criminal justice. As a prosecutor in San Francisco before becoming attorney general of California, she was a huge advocate of truancy laws that charged parents a fee for their children being truant and locking the parent up if they could not pay the fee.

A Medium.com article from June ripped into Harris for those issues: “Kamala Harris’ career was built on both the slave labor of black and brown prisoners and also the pettiness of truancy laws that separated poor and mostly black mothers from their children. Harris was so proud of her history with taking mothers from their children that she used it as her signature campaign agenda while running for AG.”

Harris was also previously vague on marijuana legalization, which she supports now, and reportedly advocated for California horrific three-strikes law.

The department said in a news release late Tuesday that detectives reviewed footage from privately-owned cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked and will broaden their search by reviewing footage from traffic cameras and public bus cameras.

Smollett told police he was walking downtown near the Chicago River at around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an “unknown substance” on him and put a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

“Empire” is shot in Chicago and is currently in production.

The Chicago Police Department has appealed for witnesses to the attack, said to have been perpetrated by two white men at 2.42am as Smollett was leaving a branch of Subway.

According to TMZ, he was approached by the men, wearing ski masks, who reportedly shouted at him 'Aren't you that f***ot Empire n*****?'

Though he tried to fight back, Smollett was beaten to the ground, had a rope put around his neck, and bleach poured on him.

""Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire,"" police told Yahoo in the US.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.""

Chicago Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi added to ABC7 that Smollett was still wearing the rope around his neck when he contacted police, in the hope it could be used by forensics.

As they left, it's claimed that they shouted 'This is MAGA country', referring to Donald Trump's slogan 'Make America Great Again', however, police have since said that if that aspect of the crime did happen, it had 'not been reported to police'.

The attack came days after reports that threatening letters had been sent to the Fox studios in Chicago, addressed to Smollett, with 'you will die black f*g' written inside in cut-out letters.

Lee Daniels, creator of the show, in which Smollett plays the gay son of Terrence Howard's Lucious and Taraji P. Henson's Cookie, posted an emotional response to the attack on his Instagram page.

""You didn't deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called 'die f****t n*****' or whatever they said to you. You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home,"" he said.

""We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows we are united on a united front and no racist f*** can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up, Jussie.""

Celebrities and political leaders continue to show their support for “Empire” star Jussie Smollett, who was attacked Tuesday in what Chicago police are investigating as a suspected hate crime. But one celebrity’s kind words were met with outrage.

Kevin Hart, who has come under fire for homophobic jokes he made in the past, addressed the “unbelievably sad” attack on Smollett in an Instagram post and a video posted to Instagram Stories, in which he decried a nation going “backwards.”

“We as people have to do better,” the comedian wrote. “WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

To Hart’s critics, those words understandably come across as sadly ironic. The comedian joked in 2011 about abusing his son if he was gay. It was just one of the many since-deleted tweets that led to Hart’s decision to step down from hosting this year’s Oscars ceremony and apologize to the LGBT community.

Hart’s critics say the attack on Smollett, a black gay man, illustrates why his homophobic jokes were so offensive.

“This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny,” TV writer Ira Madison III tweeted. Filmmaker Sam Greisman, the son of actress Sally Field, echoed, “But keep joking about beating up your kid for being gay, Kevin Hart!”

Meanwhile, poet Saeed Jones referenced Hart’s recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres, who begged people to give Hart a second chance.

“Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks. Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart,” Jones tweeted.

During the attack in Chicago, Smollett was reportedly subjected to racist and homophobic slurs while a noose was put around his neck and an “unknown chemical substance” was poured on him. Smollett also told police that his two attackers shouted, “MAGA country.”"

CHICAGO — Chicago police say they've reviewed hundreds of hours of footage from downtown surveillance cameras but haven't found footage yet of the alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett.

The department said Wednesday in a news release that detectives reviewed footage from privately-owned cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked and will broaden their search by reviewing footage from traffic cameras and public bus cameras.

Smollett told police he was walking downtown near the Chicago River at around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an ""unknown substance"" on him and put a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

CHICAGO — Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the ""persons of interest"" Wednesday evening.

Investigators ""for the most part"" can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor ""is at home and recovering.""

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.""

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

The images emerged as Smollett's representative, Brandon Z. Moore, revealed he was on the phone with the actor when the attack happened and claims to have heard the men yell 'this is MAGA country'.

'I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,' Moore told Variety.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi shared the images on Twitter Wednesday evening.

'Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,' Guglielmi wrote.

Guglielmi noted that while the video 'does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed'.

The photos show two men walking on North New Street near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday.

Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him. He was heading to his apartment at the time.

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

The release of the photos comes just hours after officers said they were unable to find an footage that showed two men attacking the actor.

Officers said that detectives reviewed CCTV video of Smollett walking to his apartment building in downtown Chicago Tuesday morning, and ‘for the most part’ they can confirm the route he took when he says he was accosted by the assailants.

However, Guglielmi noted there were gaps and none of the footage police had reviewed showed the alleged attack.

Authorities said a community alert with photos is being constructed and will be disseminated shortly.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox drama, said the white men wearing ski masks assaulted him, hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, doused him with an ‘unknown chemical substance’ previously reported as bleach and put a thin rope around his neck.

The actor, who came out as gay to Ellen in 2015, had been walking from a local Subway sandwich shop when he was jumped.

'Aren't you the f***ot 'Empire' n*****?' Smollett recalled the men yelling at him.

The men then screamed MAGA before fleeing the scene.

Smollett suffered a fractured rib during the attack and is said to have put up a fight when he was beaten.

A noose was still around his neck at 2.42am when police arrived to the scene.

The actor then took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he was treated then released on Tuesday.

Smollett had just flown into Chicago from New York City just hours before the attack.

The actor had been in the Big Apple with actor Zachary Quinto Monday morning during a reading of Richard Greenberg’s seminal play Take Me Out, according to a post Quinto shared on Instagram.

Smollett said what should have been a two-hour flight from New York City to Chicago turned into a seven-hour nightmare due to the extreme cold.

The attack took place here on Tuesday. When cops arrived at 2.42am, Smollett still had the noose around his neck

Guglielmi said detectives investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have already looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area.

Officers expanded the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the crime scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

‘We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,’ Guglielmi said earlier on Wednesday, referring to a container for the liquid that was thrown at the actor.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the US, with thousands of CCTV cameras mounted on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

It was previously reported that just a week before the alleged attack, Fox offered the singer and actor based in Chicago an entourage of body guards for protection after the show's studio received a threatening, homophobic letter addressed to Smollett.

But Smollett declined around-the-clock security because he found it intrusive, according to TMZ.

The letter threatening Smollett was sent to the Fox studio on January 22, cops said according to ABC, and was laced with a powdery substance believed to be Tylenol.

The FBI is now trying to determine if there's a link between the homophobic letter and the Tuesday attack.

Following the accident Fox has added security for the rest of the Empire cast. Much of the cast live in Chicago during filming.

On Tuesday the actor was brutally attacked by two white men wearing ski masks yelling 'This is MAGA country' as they poured bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, that appears to be dated from January 18, stating that 'You will die black f*g'. Fox Studio received the letter on the 22nd and cops said it was laced with powder Tylenol

Smollett told CNN that he was shaken and angry following the incident.

His co-star Terrence Howard, who plays his father on Empire, described Smollett as furious on Good Morning America.

'I heard he's getting better. You now, he's angry. But I know Jussie. Jussie's anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won't, and we can't, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance,' Howard said.

'Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood. He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family — you know, the Fox family, the family, the Lyon family — were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today,' the 49-year-old actor added.

Howard said when the cast learned of the attack their 'jaws dropped to the ground'.

'When we learned that there had been letters that had been sent to Fox as threats about the potential about this, then we became much more frightened, he added.

Smollett missed shooting on the set on Tuesday as he recovered from the brutal attack.

He reportedly still intends to return to the set and Empire will resume as planned.

Smollett's sister, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, was spotted on the set of her new movie, Birds of Prey, a spinoff of Suicide Squad, a day after her brother was attacked.

Smollett-Bell was holding her toddler son Hunter as she wrapped up filming in Los Angeles.

Police have made no arrests and have no solid suspects at this time. They are opening the investigation for surveillance footage from nearby businesses and traffic cameras

Chicago Police said they canvassed the upscale downtown neighborhood where Smollett was attacked and found no still images or video from security cameras of the attack.

Cops have obtained surveillance footage of Smollett inside a Subway before the attack, but not any footage of the assailants.

'The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras. As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders,' Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

'Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect's vehicle to be able to share,' he added.

Police have made no arrests and have no solid suspects at this time. They are opening the investigation to nearby businesses, traffic cameras, and nearby streets for surveillance footage.

A dozen police detectives and FBI are working in the case, according to CNN.

'Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,' police said.

Smollett rose to fame play Jamal Lyon - an openly gay singer - on Fox's 'Empire' in 2015.

The show released a statement following the incident.

The Chicago Police Department is investigating the case as a racially-charged battery and assault

Prior to the attack, Smollett had been stranded in LaGuardia's Airpot in New York for upwards of five hours while he waited for weather to become permissible in Chicago

20th Century Fox released a statement sending their love and support to the actor

'We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our 'Empire' family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,' the show said.

'We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate -- and especially against one of our own,' the statement added.

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollet received a cut out letter that appears to be dated as January 18 that stated 'You will die black f*g'.

Prior to the attack, Smollett had been stranded in LaGuardia's Airport in New York for upwards of five hours while he waited for weather to become permissible in Chicago.

He updated his followers throughout the day showing the weather in Chicago and talking about his flight delays.

Following the horrific accident, celebrities and politicians have voiced their support for the actor and demand justice.

Every single Democrat who has entered the 2020 primary had issued a statement condemning the individuals who committed this act by Tuesday afternoon.

Chicago – Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Earlier: ‘Empire’ star Smollett attacked in possible hate crime

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Ours is not a country governed by philosopher kings. The Founding Fathers, instead, predicated our government as one of the people. And it is Congress, the gathering of popularly elected representatives, which is given that weighty law-writing authority.

According to ancient Greek philosopher Plato, it is the great thinkers, or philosophers, who are best suited to govern society. Dubbed “philosopher kings” they use wisdom, Plato says, to determine how society should operate.

On Monday, the Supreme Court, through Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, decided that the term “sex” in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 now includes “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” Discriminating against potential or current employees on the basis of sexual orientation or transgendered status, therefore, is now illegal in all fifty states.

The Court decreed the new definition by a vote of 6-3, with two GOP-appointed judges, including Trump-appointee Neil Gorsuch, joining the liberal wing. Justice Gorsuch, in fact, authored the majority’s opinion.

According to Dr. Russell Moore, a leader in the Southern Baptist Convention, the ruling “will have seismic implications for religious liberty, setting off potentially years of lawsuits and court struggles, about what this means, for example, for religious organizations with religious convictions about the meaning of sex and sexuality.”

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, although it includes provisions against discrimination on the basis of sex, was written to address the racial injustice in voting, employment, and other basic civil rights that black Americans faced on a regular basis.

It was not written to protect those who identify as transgender or as homosexual.

So how did the Court determine that, after almost sixty years, the hard-earned legislative victory won by black Americans for their freedoms also applied to the LGBT community?

Enter the philosopher kings.

Through a series of truly innovative and creative arguments, the Court attempts to make the point that discriminating on the basis of homosexual or transgender status is, in fact, discriminating on the basis of sex.

Here is one such argument by Justice Gorsuch:

“Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer’s mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other is a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague.”

And thus, we have discrimination based, at least partially, on sex. And Title VII does not allow such discrimination.

There are multiple problems with the Court’s logic.

First is that the example does not stand up. As Justice Alito mentions in his dissent, the employees are not “materially identical” except for sex. Sexual orientation, it is clear, is the material difference–a material difference that is not mentioned in Title VII. This difference, Alito argues, makes it so that “we cannot infer…that the employer was motivated in part by sex.”

Second is the problem of ordinary public meaning, a historical question that typically governs how the Court rules on issues of language. What did the term “sex” mean in the context of the bill’s writing? Did it include sexual orientation and gender identity? We know, of course, that “sex”, defined by the Oxford Dictionary as “either of the two main categories (male and female) into which humans and most other living things are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions,” did not mean these things.

And it still doesn’t.

The philosopher kings on the bench, however, easily push these concerns aside.

“[L]egislative history has no bearing here,” they say.

As Justice Kavanaugh points out in his dissent, the Court disregards the fact that, since Congress enacted Title VII in 1964, they have “never treated sexual orientation discrimination the same as, or as a form of, sex discrimination” but as “legally distinct categories of discrimination.”

Disregarded is the reality that the Supreme Court itself, when dealing with applicable cases, has never once in its history suggested that sexual orientation discrimination was a form of sex discrimination. Nineteen justices on the court could have hinted at this. They didn’t.

Disregarded, and this is especially important, is that fact that Congress could act on the issue if and when it wanted to.

Disregarded as well are the consequences of the Court’s actions to cases concerning housing, employment by religious organizations, healthcare, the freedom of speech, and confusion regarding race and age dysphoria.

The philosopher kings will figure that out, too, when they get the chance. Don’t worry.

Regardless, these back-end consequences about religious liberty and American freedom are just part of the problem. Also important is the disregard demonstrated by the Court for the legislative process, for Congress, and for the Constitution that allocates the law-writing authority to elected representatives, not appointed lawyers who want to exercise their mental jiu-jitsu skills.

Even so, the blame is not the Court’s alone. Congress has largely given up its authority to create laws and delegated both to the executive in the form of regulatory power (agencies writing regulations which have the effect of law) and to the courts by not holding the judiciary accountable, up to impeachment, for violating the Constitution.

We, everyday Americans, are not absolved of blame here either.

The truth is that, if Congress was full of representatives who wanted to uphold their duty to the Constitution, they would do just that. So who elects Congress?

Oh right. We do.

So until Americans decide that our representatives need to regain the duties deemed to them by our Founding Fathers through the Constitution, we’ll continue to see law handed down to us by justices, presidents, and bureaucrats. Philosopher kings.

Anyone but the people.

Steve Harvey is showing incredibly strong support for Jussie Smollett -- particularly as a black man, but he seems to be dismissing one major part of the alleged attack.

Steve posted this video undoubtedly to make it clear how much support Jussie is getting around the country. As he put it, ""I don't have all that eloquent stuff to say. As a black man in this country, I'm down with you.""

He also made a point of saying, ""This ain't about sexual preference or nothing.""

You know Jussie says his attackers used a homophobic slur, as well as the n-word -- and we know the threatening letter sent to him at Fox Studios also used a homophobic slur. Seems Jussie's sexual preference is definitely relevant to the alleged attack.

But, Steve says very strongly, for him ... ""This is about coming to the aid of another brother that has tasted the brutality of hatred, racism and bigotry.""

On that ... almost all of us would agree.

Jussie Smollett will now have round-the-clock security following the brutally homophobic and racist attack he endured in Chicago earlier this week, sources said.

According to TMZ, the Empire star will have 24/7 armed security at least until the two men who attacked him Tuesday morning are apprehended.

Smollett was grabbing a quick bite from a local Subway when he was attacked by two men wearing “Make America Great Again” hats. The thugs beat him, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him, and tied a noose around his neck while calling him racist and homophobic slurs.

“This is MAGA country,” they allegedly told Smollett.

The actor was able to get himself to a local hospital, where he is reportedly in good condition.

The FBI and Chicago Police Department are now investigating the attack as a possible hate crime.

Hundreds of celebrities have shared their outrage towards the attack, and support for Smollett during this difficult time.

The actor plans to return to shooting hit Fox series in the near future, production sources said.

A rep for Smollett had no comment, but did tell ESSENCE Wednesday that a donation page has been set up in Smollett’s name at the Black AIDS Institute as the actor is passionate about ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic."

The star of Empire received a letter that was sent to the Fox Studios offices in Chicago, per TMZ, and that security for the cast was increased when the missive, which was reported by the news outlet to be “threatening and homophobic,” appeared.

TMZ alleges that Smollett refused extra security that would have been provided by Fox Studios when he was not at the studio. It is alleged that he did not want his day-to-day life to be altered by having to be tailed by a security detail.

Shortly before the attack, Smollett posted a photo and caption to Instagram where he stated he was happy to land in Chicago after spending “seven hours on a plane for a two-hour flight.” He also used the hashtag, “Chicago weather ain’t no joke.” Smollett was attacked by two men upon returning to Chicago after a trip to New York City. TMZ reported the actor was headed to a local Subway sandwich shop for food around two in the morning when the ambush occurred.

The New York Times reported Smollett was walking when two men began yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, hit the actor in the face, and poured what the outlet called an “unknown chemical substance” on him. The attackers also wrapped a rope around the actor’s neck before they left the scene.

The New York Times reported that both 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement on Tuesday about the attack. The statement read that the “entire studio, network, and production stand united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate.”

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” said a police spokesperson quoted by the New York Times.

The police questioned Smollett after the attack and he revealed while he was brutalized, the attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country.”

MAGA is an acronym for Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” It is a brand that he used throughout his 2016 presidential campaign. This is the second time a MAGA hat was worn in several weeks in what appeared to be racist incidents.

In January, a young man from Covington Catholic High School in Park Hills, Kentucky wore a MAGA hat and stood face-to-face with a native elder who was beating a drum during the Indigenous Peoples March held in Washington, DC reported Vox. Several of his fellow students were also seen making fun of the marchers, with some appearing to shout “Build that wall, build that wall.”

Smollett is reportedly eager to get back to work on Empire, reported TMZ. The publication also reported that the FBI is investigating to see if the letter Smollett received and the attack are connected."

According to TMZ, his attackers also screamed, “Aren’t you that f—-t ‘Empire’ n—–r?” after he was leaving a local subway in Chicago. Some worry this attack may have been premeditated—as ABC News reported that Smollett received a hate note in the mail a week prior to the attack.

Tuesday’s attack sent ripples across many communities who identify with Smollett—a Black, queer person. It’s an intersection that often doesn’t get much space when we talk about discrimination.

I'm seeing an uncomfortable amount of people not mentioning the homophobia when discussing the racism in the attack against Jussie Smollett and vice-versa. Queer & Trans POC face the most violence, and ignoring intersectionality harms those most vulnerable first. — Queer🌈Space🌌Communism☭ (@QueerlyCanadian) January 29, 2019

One thing not being touched upon as much as it should be (at least not by the media) about the attempted lynching of Jussie Smollett is the intersectionality at play. The men who attacked him yelled out racist and homophobic slurs before their noose-and-bleach attack on him. — Pharoah Bolding (@pharoahbolding) January 30, 2019

The fact that some of y'all, including LGBT+ identifying folk, are trying to say that the unfortunate attack on Jussie Smollett is more of a gay attack than a racist attack and vice versa, contribute to the erasure of the intersectionality of Queer Black people. — Zaya Wade Stan Account (@kay_suigeneris) January 29, 2019

Smollet is also Jewish, and the Jewish community on Twitter has rallied in support for him since the attack.

This sickening, vile reported attack on @EmpireFOX star @JussieSmollett is a disturbing reminder of the terrible homophobia & racism that plagues society.

For an attack in which the perpetrators used expletives specifically against the Black community (the n-word) and the gay community (the f-word), not to mention a noose and possibly bleach, people were justifiably infuriated that the attack wasn’t described for what it was—racist and homophobic.

Hi there, journalists!



I'm a historian who's written about white supremacists, so let me assure you that when a violent attack on an African American man involves use of the N-word and the literal placement of a noose around his neck, you can go ahead and call that ""racist."" — Kevin M.

I can't take you describing what happened to Jussie Smollett as a ""possible"" hate crime. There's no ""possible,"" it's the DEFINITION of a hate crime. Every time, we don't call a hate crime a hate crime it perpetuate this hate & this horrific violence.

Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago PD chief communications officer who tweeted about the department investigating the “possible” hate crime, told the Daily Dot in an email that the crime “is being investigated as a hate crime based on the narrative provided by the victim and the racial and homophobic language used during the assault. We continue to investigate the allegations and look for any evidence that could help us lead to the identity of an offender.”

In Illinois, a person committing “assault, battery, aggravated assault,” among other forms of abuse and/or harassment against another person due to their “actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, or national origin” classifies as hate crime and is a criminal offense.

Seems pretty cut and dry."

The attack came after Fox Studios received a letter addressed to Jussie that said, “You will die Black f*ag.”

The return address said, “MAGA.”

Since our report yesterday, more details have emerged about the attack. According to TMZ, in a follow-up interview, Smollett confirmed that the men yelled “MAGA country.” Police say that when Jussie reached authorities, at 2:42 AM, he still had the rope around his neck. Production sources say that Jussie, along with the other main “Empire” stars will have armed security while they shoot scenes for the show in Chicago. Smollett will travel with armed guards 24/7.

According to an earlier report from TMZ, Fox offered additional bodyguards for Smollett after they received the letter. But he decided not to utilize the extra bodyguards when he wasn’t working. He said moving with security around the clock was intrusive

While there were some who questioned the validity of the story, (including Erykah Badu,) Lee Daniels posted and then deleted a screenshot of Smollett in bed, a scratch or cut under his left eye.

TMZ also reported that police secured surveillance footage from a nearby Target. The video shows Smollett walking down the street. They’ve also visited a nearby apartment complex to ask for video.

The FBI is also investigating the letter sent to Fox Studios, addressed to Smollett and are trying to determine if the two attacks are connected.

Naturally, Smollett missed shooting on Tuesday but we’re told he plans to return soon. Until then, the shooting schedule will be adjusted to accommodate his absence.

Fox issued a statement addressing the incident.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stand united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Several celebrities utilized their social media platforms as a way to share their condolences and express their support of Smollett in the wake of this attack. But it was also a time for others on social media to remind folks, particularly those with homophobic beliefs and rhetoric about the real world ramifications of their words and subsequent actions.

Many were able to draw a parallel to the violence Smollett experienced to the violence Hart described in one of his old “jokes” he shared on both Twitter and the stage. Not to mention the joke was followed by Hart’s refusal to apologize and then a media tour, including a stop on “Ellen” explaining why he wouldn’t apologize. All trash.

When Hart offered his condolences to Smollett, the backlash immediately followed.

The full details are even worse:

Around 2 AM [Smollett] was hungry and went to a Subway. We’re told when he walked out, someone yelled, ‘Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?’ The 2 men — both white and wearing ski masks — viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, ‘This is MAGA country.’

This is absolutely vile, repulsive stuff. (TMZ also links to another article about a threat the actor received in the mail just eight days ago, suggesting this whole thing could have actually been a premeditated attack.) A statement from Chicago Police Department confirmed many of the worst details from TMZ’s report, including the rope, the racial and homophobic slurs, and the pouring of an “unknown chemical substance” on Smollett.

Thankfully, Smollett, who plays Jamal on Empire, was in good enough condition following the assault that he was able to go home from the hospital on Tuesday morning. Hopefully the men who are responsible for this are brought to justice very quickly."

NFL player Charles Leno, Jr. went viral after he proposed to his longtime girlfriend Jennifer Roth on national television on the football field after a game last month. Days later, Roth’s disgustingly racist tweets surfaced from the past and she locked all of her social media accounts. Well, if anyone thought racism was a deal breaker for Leno, think again. The marriage is still on, she has unlocked all of her accounts and she is back to bragging about her man, a star for the Chicago Bears.

Roth posted a photo just the other day showing her with two friends wearing a shirt that reads “bridesmaids.” Her shirt that says “bride.”

She wrote in the caption, “So, I did a thing today 😊 Shout out to two of my best friends for making the drive to Orlando to sit in the pouring rain with me to watch Len at his first pro bowl game. Can’t wait to have yall stand beside me.”

Up until Dec. 17, Roth was constantly bragging about her rich NFL player man with public social media accounts. She even had a blog dedicated to their romance. However, the day after he proposed to her on national television, she went silent with all of the comments disabled on her social media.

Back on Nov. 8, Roth seemed to know she was going to get a proposal and was gloating on her Facebook page:

Roth has never addressed her deeply offensive tweets and neither has Leno.

Neither one of them has made any public comments about her racist tweets.

The 27-year-old offensive tackle, who signed a $38 million extension deal with the Bears last year, got down on one knee in the middle of Soldier’s Field and popped the question.

See the video below:

Twenty-four hours later, several tweets surfaced of her using the N-word, mocking dark-skinned Black men, calling Black people “ghetto” and saying how “Black guys treat white girls” on campus. See the tweets from Leno’s future wife below:

Roth is probably ecstatic to be booed up with an NFL player who landed a $38 million extension deal. According to her LinkedIn profile, she has sports management degrees from Columbia College Chicago and Eastern Illinois University but works at City Barbecue in Deerfield, Illinois. Her intro described herself as an “Experienced Specialist with a demonstrated history of working in the sports industry and non-profit sector.”

Being that Leno decided to do a public proposal, he shouldn’t be surprised that people are not going to quickly forget her public racism.

The FBI also joins the PD in seeking out and scouring video footage and searching for potential witnesses from around the scene where Smollett reported being attacked by two men (who placed a noose around his neck) yelling homophobic and racial slurs at around 2:00am on Tuesday. The Chicago PD asks anyone with information about the attack to call 312-717-8382 or report tips anonymously at cpdtip.com.

CBS News is reporting some new details, including how Smollett’s business manager was the person who called police after the attack. Dispatchers were not keen to divulge much but stated that the call was made “regarding a friend who was assaulted and battered … he’s supposed to be well-known … a noose was placed around the friend’s neck.” CBS also states that when police arrived at Smollett’s apartment, a “noose was still around” the actor’s neck. The officers also confirmed smelling bleach on Smollett’s clothing in their documentation.

Filming on Empire continued as scheduled on Tuesday, according to Variety:

Empire filming is continuing as scheduled for the day, a source tells Variety, amid the assault and subsequent hospitalization of star Jussie Smollett early Tuesday in Chicago. The Fox show’s production schedule remains “fluid” for the rest of the week, according to the source. It is not yet known how Smollett’s injuries will ultimately impact production on the current season, which would typically wrap in March.

Following the attack, GLAAD rallied around Smollett, an openly gay actor who plays a gay member of the musical family dynasty on the FOX series. He received support from FOX, Empire executive producer Danny Strong, and many other entertainment and political figures. Among those who are standing behind him is Empire co-creator Lee Daniels, who posted this emotional video to Instagram. “You didn’t deserve,” he stated. “Nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you.”

I had just parked outside of my South Los Angeles apartment, back from a morning trip to the gym. With a fresh gel manicure, I had on highlighter-orange shorts that hit mid-thigh, a light blue tank, and black sneakers. As I walked to the gate from my car, a man walking his rottweiler began walking toward me. I sped up, readying my keys.

As I opened the gate, he called out, “Ayo blood! Take that faggot shit somewhere else. We don't do that gay shit here.”

I slammed the gate behind me.

“You can ignore me if you want faggot,” he said, steadily approaching. “Next time I see you imma sock you in your fucking face.”

I sped off into my apartment, bypassed my roommate and his friend, and took a shower. Though I wasn’t physically assaulted, I was shaken. It was one of the first times that I actually feared for my safety.

Upon hearing the news that Jussie Smollett faced a homophobic and racist attack Tuesday in Chicago, I was brought back to that same emotional place. Sitting in my bed, tears rolled down my face, prompted, once more, by a stark reality, that while being Black, LGBTQ+, and visible is a revolutionary act, visibility alone doesn’t protect us.

Reports say that Smollett, who had just returned to Chicago from New York to film Empire, left his apartment around 2 a.m. to get something to eat from Subway. Upon being recognized as “that faggot Empire n*****?,” sources reportedly said to TMZ, Smollett was assaulted by two men who poured bleach on him and put his head in a noose. Police confirmed that Smollett said his attackers yelled ""MAGA country"" as they attacked him. Police also told Out over the phone Tuesday night that they currently have no description, including the racial identity or gender, of the attackers.

Still, much of the online support directed at the actor-singer who came out as gay on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2015 has rightly pointed out how Donald Trump’s vile, racist behavior has emboldened seemingly-nascent white supremacist attitudes countrywide. But what we have on our hands is about more than how divisive our country continues to be around race. Smollett is Black and gay and known worldwide as both. He was attacked with the intersection of those identities in mind.

Many people have been duped into believing that life for LGBTQ+ people is better than ever. With the legalization of marriage equality and shows like Pose on television, perhaps that’s so. But I’d rather not ignore the very real experiences of countless members of our communities who at minimum would note, to quote Langston Hughes, that life ain’t been no crystal stair. And while some LGBTQ+ people claim not to “see color” and some in the Black community believe one’s queerness is second to one’s race, Black queer people still must bear the brunt of racism and homophobia and transphobia.

Yet, we’ve been taught that visibility is one of our greatest weapons in the fight for equality, respect, and liberation. Mantras like “I’m Black and I’m proud,” or “We’re here, we’re queer, and we’d like to say hello,” have been used to encourage us to stand unapologetically in our identities, to claim space, and to assert our humanity. Surely it’s necessary in a world that would rather us not. But for every closet we step out of, a target appears on our backs, and the Blacker we are and the more visibly queer we are, the greater our chances of having to defend our dignity.

Each day I wake, I stare in the mirror just long enough to muster the energy necessary to leave my house, the audacity necessary to live out loud, and the wherewithal to know the potential dangers that come with it. Nevertheless I persist, very much aware that because I find no other option but to be my most authentic self in public, someone might want to teach me, and by proxy those like me, a lesson. I’m sure that’s what Smollett’s attackers thought.

But this not to say that one shouldn’t be out and proud. Rather, it’s a call to the broader Black and LGBTQ+ communities to fight for Black LGBTQ+ people, especially those trans and gender nonconforming, as fervently as we fight for you. Because visibility alone won’t protect us, and it is not until we are free that you are free.

The FBI has joined the investigation into the alleged racist, homophobic attack that left Empire star Jussie Smollett in the hospital.

Police are investigating Tuesday’s brutal attack in Chicago as a “possible” hate crime after Smollett told authorities he was beaten by two white men in ski masks who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him. It appears the attackers also put a noose around the 35-year-old actor’s neck and poured an unknown substance, possibly bleach, on him, while yelling, “This is MAGA country.”

The FBI is involved because Smollett received a chilling letter in the mail that contained threatening language and a powdery substance that police believe was Tylenol.

The letter was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago on Jan. 22.

Smollett was treated and released from Northwestern Memorial Hospital."

To say Wednesday was a whirlwind of emotions is putting it lightly.

A rollercoaster ride of progression has surfaced regarding the reported homophobic and racist attack on Jussie Smollett that occurred late Monday night (into Tuesday). The suspected hate crime involved two men wearing ski-masks who approached Smollett around 2 a.m. and hurled bigoted slurs at him as well as dousing an “unknown chemical substance” on the 35-year-old.

The Chicago Police Department (CPD) recently confirmed with ABC News that the FBI is assisting in the current investigation. CPD is also investigating the previously reported letter threat sent to the actor and singer.

Following the horrendously tragic news, a flock of celebrities and influencers showered Smollett with love and support via social media. Shortly after Empire co-creator Danny Strong tweeted a statement on the incident, Lee Daniels posted an Instagram video offering his support to Smollett, as well.

“It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie, you are my son,” Daniels mused, through oncoming tears. “You didn’t deserve—nor anybody deserves—to have a noose put around your neck. To have bleach thrown on you. To be called ‘die faggot, nigger’ or whatever they said to you. You are better than that.”

One thing to note: shortly before news of the attack came, Smollett posted something on Instagram regarding an extra-long travel process for what was to be a simple two -hour flight. The inclement weather in Chicago was to blame.

It initially alarmed me since it made me wonder if the reported assailants tracked him from this post. A scary and sobering reminder on how social media can be dangerous for a prominent figure.

Alas, I’m sure all of this is being taken into account now that the FBI is involved.

At the time of this article’s posting, Smollett hasn’t released an official statement on the matter. The Root has reached out to Smollett’s team for comment and, of course, we extend our well wishes to him and his family as he recovers and processes these events.

Nancy Pelosi called it “an affront to our humanity,” while Emma Watson lashed out at the “ugly prejudice and bigotry behind this violence.”

Kevin Hart also voiced his disgust at the attack, during which police say the openly gay Smollett was subjected to racist and homophobic slurs while a noose was put around his neck and an “unknown chemical substance” was poured on him. Smollett also confirmed to police that his two attackers shouted, “MAGA country.”

Hart addressed the “unbelievably sad” attack in an Instagram post and a video posted to Instagram Stories, in which he decried society going “backwards.”

“We as people have to do better,” the comedian wrote. “WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? … I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

Despite the seemingly heartfelt statement, Hart is facing new scrutiny over the homophobic jokes he made during old stand-up routines and on Twitter. The off-color remarks, in which Hart joked about discouraging his son from being gay, caused backlash that resulted in his stepping down from hosting this year’s Oscars ceremony. Ellen DeGeneres was also criticized for saying Hart should be given a “second chance.”

Hart’s critics say the attack on Smollett, a black gay man, illustrates why his homophobic jokes were so reviled.

This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny — Ira (@ira) January 29, 2019

But keep joking about beating up your kid for being gay, Kevin Hart! — sam greisman (@SAMGREIS) January 29, 2019

Where’s Kevin Hart and DL Hughley with some more of their little homophobic jokes? Since it’s all just funny and accountability isn’t important. — Preston Mitchum (@PrestonMitchum) January 29, 2019

Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks. Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart. — Saeed Jones (@theferocity) January 29, 2019

This is your reminder that Kevin Hart was given a publicity tour to declare that being an ally to LGBTQ folks is not his life's goal or dream and that he's done apologizing. This is your reminder that his jokes reflect actual attitudes that produce what happened to Jussie. — Dana (@DanaVivianWhite) January 29, 2019

Queer Eye co-host Jonathan Van Ness, meanwhile, responded to Hart’s Instagram post by offering a teaching moment — though some Hart fans accused him of picking on the Jumanji star.

‘Queer people need straight people to be very clear about why people choose hate; they chose hate because they don’t know better,” he wrote. “That’s why we need allies to call homophobia what it is by name and stand in solidarity in name with LGBTQ people.”

Others put it more bluntly.

10:55 AM PT: — Kevin Hart has seemingly responded to the criticism, writing a lengthy message that reads:



Instagram: @kevinhart

Kevin Hart is gaining more scrutiny from the LGBTQ community for speaking out about the alleged hate crime on ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett.

The ""Night School"" star took to IG to send well wishes to Smollett after he claims two men attacked him early Tuesday morning, put a noose around his neck and threw bleach on him outside his Chicago apartment.

""Why are we going backwards....this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world????,"" Kevin Hart wrote. ""Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people....Choose love...I repeat...Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.""

Fans are calling Kevin a hypocrite, once again pointing out the homophobic comments he's made in the past.

""You were just throwing hissy fits about not being able to make homophobic jokes. You're a trash piece of sh*t and this is disrespectful honestly,"" one person wrote. ""This was done by people who also don't want their son to play with a doll house because they think 'that's gay.' In the same vein as you infamous tweets,"" said another.

Some people took a more analytical approach, telling Hart, ""This is why people were so enraged by your jokes and comments. Joking about abusing Queer POC is not okay. It adds to a culture that allows this kind of horrific crime to take place.""

Kevin, who stepped down as this year's Oscars host after homophobic comments were unearthed, could not even recover from the controversy with an appearance on ""The Ellen Show.""

As The Blast reported, police are currently searching for video evidence of Jussie's alleged attack, and investigating the incident as a possible hate crime."

Ours is not a country governed by philosopher kings. The Founding Fathers, instead, predicated our government as one of the people. And it is Congress, the gathering of popularly elected representatives, which is given that weighty law-writing authority.

According to ancient Greek philosopher Plato, it is the great thinkers, or philosophers, who are best suited to govern society. Dubbed “philosopher kings” they use wisdom, Plato says, to determine how society should operate.

On Monday, the Supreme Court, through Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, decided that the term “sex” in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 now includes “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” Discriminating against potential or current employees on the basis of sexual orientation or transgendered status, therefore, is now illegal in all fifty states.

The Court decreed the new definition by a vote of 6-3, with two GOP-appointed judges, including Trump-appointee Neil Gorsuch, joining the liberal wing. Justice Gorsuch, in fact, authored the majority’s opinion.

According to Dr. Russell Moore, a leader in the Southern Baptist Convention, the ruling “will have seismic implications for religious liberty, setting off potentially years of lawsuits and court struggles, about what this means, for example, for religious organizations with religious convictions about the meaning of sex and sexuality.”

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, although it includes provisions against discrimination on the basis of sex, was written to address the racial injustice in voting, employment, and other basic civil rights that black Americans faced on a regular basis.

It was not written to protect those who identify as transgender or as homosexual.

So how did the Court determine that, after almost sixty years, the hard-earned legislative victory won by black Americans for their freedoms also applied to the LGBT community?

Enter the philosopher kings.

Through a series of truly innovative and creative arguments, the Court attempts to make the point that discriminating on the basis of homosexual or transgender status is, in fact, discriminating on the basis of sex.

Here is one such argument by Justice Gorsuch:

“Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer’s mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other is a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague.”

And thus, we have discrimination based, at least partially, on sex. And Title VII does not allow such discrimination.

There are multiple problems with the Court’s logic.

First is that the example does not stand up. As Justice Alito mentions in his dissent, the employees are not “materially identical” except for sex. Sexual orientation, it is clear, is the material difference–a material difference that is not mentioned in Title VII. This difference, Alito argues, makes it so that “we cannot infer…that the employer was motivated in part by sex.”

Second is the problem of ordinary public meaning, a historical question that typically governs how the Court rules on issues of language. What did the term “sex” mean in the context of the bill’s writing? Did it include sexual orientation and gender identity? We know, of course, that “sex”, defined by the Oxford Dictionary as “either of the two main categories (male and female) into which humans and most other living things are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions,” did not mean these things.

And it still doesn’t.

The philosopher kings on the bench, however, easily push these concerns aside.

“[L]egislative history has no bearing here,” they say.

As Justice Kavanaugh points out in his dissent, the Court disregards the fact that, since Congress enacted Title VII in 1964, they have “never treated sexual orientation discrimination the same as, or as a form of, sex discrimination” but as “legally distinct categories of discrimination.”

Disregarded is the reality that the Supreme Court itself, when dealing with applicable cases, has never once in its history suggested that sexual orientation discrimination was a form of sex discrimination. Nineteen justices on the court could have hinted at this. They didn’t.

Disregarded, and this is especially important, is that fact that Congress could act on the issue if and when it wanted to.

Disregarded as well are the consequences of the Court’s actions to cases concerning housing, employment by religious organizations, healthcare, the freedom of speech, and confusion regarding race and age dysphoria.

The philosopher kings will figure that out, too, when they get the chance. Don’t worry.

Regardless, these back-end consequences about religious liberty and American freedom are just part of the problem. Also important is the disregard demonstrated by the Court for the legislative process, for Congress, and for the Constitution that allocates the law-writing authority to elected representatives, not appointed lawyers who want to exercise their mental jiu-jitsu skills.

Even so, the blame is not the Court’s alone. Congress has largely given up its authority to create laws and delegated both to the executive in the form of regulatory power (agencies writing regulations which have the effect of law) and to the courts by not holding the judiciary accountable, up to impeachment, for violating the Constitution.

We, everyday Americans, are not absolved of blame here either.

The truth is that, if Congress was full of representatives who wanted to uphold their duty to the Constitution, they would do just that. So who elects Congress?

Oh right. We do.

So until Americans decide that our representatives need to regain the duties deemed to them by our Founding Fathers through the Constitution, we’ll continue to see law handed down to us by justices, presidents, and bureaucrats. Philosopher kings.

Anyone but the people.

Fans and stars have been rallying in support of actor Jussie Smollett after news broke of the heinous, homophobic and racially motivated assault he endured in Chicago.

Smollett was reportedly beaten in Chicago by two masked men who also wrapped a rope around his neck, doused him with a chemical liquid and allegedly shouted homophobic slurs and that “this is MAGA country.”

Some of the stars expressing support for Smollet, as well as anger that his attack even happened, include actors Chadwick Boseman, Niecy Nash and Kerry Washington, Civil Rights activists like Al Sharpton and countless politicians, peers and fans.

Lee Daniels, co-creator of Empire which Smollet stars in, offered a profound reaction on IG (see below). See more of the reactions in the gallery."

The star of the Fox drama “Empire” who is openly gay said they used racial and homophobic epithets as they beat him, poured bleach on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck.

Outrage has flooded in, more so once the details became the assailants were whites wearing red Donald Trump hats, and were said to have shouted “MAGA Country” during the assault. A wide array of politicians, celebrities, and members of the media have risen to voice outrage at this attack. As Sister Toldjah mentioned yesterday, caution would be the best approach with this episode, especially in light of the fiasco they made of the Covington students story.

Also, especially in light of some of the details of this new story. While most in the media are repeating the same outline of the events there are official aspects to this event that should inspire caution. Politicians from Kamala Harris to Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden have weighed in on what they see as a defacto hate-crime. Cory Booker has gone so far as to politicize this, using it to promote his pet anti-lynching legislation.

But questions arise after seeking out official reports from the Chicago area authorities. Beyond the hype cycle there are aspects of Smollett’s case that require further investigation. These do not disprove his testimony, however there is also not enough to validate. Here are some items from police officials that are being under-reported.

Smollett’s initial report to police were of attackers wearing a mask. He did not identify them by race at that time. It was after those details were broadcast on social media that detectivess interviewed the singer a second time. It was then that Smollett told police of the racial component to his story.

As CBS News reported, “In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett said his attackers yelled ‘MAGA country’ during the assault, Chicago police confirmed.” Even CNN’s Brian Stelter noted this came about in a secondary interview.

Smollett returned to an apartment, and it was from there that the call to emergency services was made. When police responded Smollett requested the officers turn off their body-cameras before he gave his statement.

According to the local ABC affiliate the incident was reported to take place around 2:00 am. When the call to police was made by 2:42 am Smollett was said to still be wearing the rope around his neck. This means Smollett left the scene, arrived at the apartment, and awaited police without ever removing the threat.

Smollett initially refused a transport to the hospital. He later drove to the hospital on his own.

There is video of Smollett inside a local Subway sandwich business near the time of the attack, but as of 11:00 pm Chicago PD states “Thus far, no video of the alleged assailants or a vehicle has been discovered but we are continuing to broaden our search.”

While the initial reports are that Smollett was doused with bleach, official reports now list it as “an unknown substance”.

The prospect of bigoted individuals lying in wait at that hour for the possible arrival of a potential victim seems remote. To add to the scene, at that time in Chicago the outside temperature was at or below 0 degrees, and lower with a windchill.

None of the above details disprove anything, and the investigation is ongoing. But there are also plenty of portions of these official reports that would give reason for press and politicians to pump the brakes on the “hate-crime” rhetoric. For now we have only the testimony of a lone person, with no witnesses nor evidence to support the claims.

When the likes of Al Sharpton and Michael Avenatti are rushing to condemn President Trump already, you can see the need for the call for modulated voices on this story.

But we live in binary times, and the rush for outrage means there is enough to this story for the social hordes to rush out and make claims. Meanwhile, the truth seems to still be tugging on it trousers.

Chicago police confirmed the FBI is investigating the vicious attack on the 36-year-old actor, ABC News reported.

Bizarrely, the attack was still being framed as a possible hate crime but people like Sen. Kamala Harris are clear.

“@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery,” she wrote on Twitter Tuesday. “This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

While walking to a Subway in Chicago, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the 36-year-old actor after he exited the restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They punched him, allegedly poured bleach on him and one of the suspects also put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

“The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric,” the NAACP said in a statement. “It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse. As this rhetoric continues to bleed into our everyday lives, dangerous behavior will continue to place many law abiding individuals at risk.”

Here’s a police statement about its investigation.

Smollett, 35, who stars as Jamal Lyon on Fox's ""Empire,"" is recovering after he was attacked on Tuesday by two unknown men in what was a homophobic and racially-charged incident in Chicago.

The Chicago Police Department said that the television star was walking down a street when he was approached by the men who yelled out racial and homophobic slurs.

Smollett was attacked about the face and the men also poured a chemical substance onto him and tied a rope around his neck.

""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,"" 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.

""The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate - especially against one of our own.""

Lee Daniels, the co-creator of Empire, posted his thoughts in a video on Instagram. ""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck,"" he said.

""You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that. It starts at home, it starts at home yo. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett's apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven't found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor ""is at home and recovering.""

Meanwhile, police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose images police released to the public late Wednesday. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have information that could be useful to the investigation.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

U.S. President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

Jussie Smollett is famous, but not so famous that he can’t walk the streets comfortably without people freaking out as if he was Beyoncé. At least so he thought…

According to TMZ, the brass at Fox in Chicago ordered extra security for the set of Empire after they received the racist and homophobic letter wi.th MAGA written on it that has been circulating social media. Fox specifically wanted to beef up Jussie’s security around-the-clock, even off hours, but he declined citing that it was intrusive to his natural way of life.

After yesterdays attack, TMZ is told that Jussie WILL have a 24-hour security detail at least until the two suspects are arrested. It is reported that Jussie will return to the show soon as his injuries heal.

Both local Chicago police and the FBI are investigating to determine if the letter and the attack are connected. Damn near impossible to believe that they aren’t, but ok.

Get well Jussie. Our thoughts and prayers are with you."

Celebrities have shared messages of support for Empire actor Jussie Smollett after he was attacked in what police suspect was a hate crime.

Investigators said he was struck in the face before having an “unknown chemical substance” poured over him and a rope wrapped around his neck.

Abused during the attack

The suspects shouted racial and homophobic slurs during the attack, police said. No arrests have been made.

Police also confirmed Smollett told them his attackers made reference to MAGA – “Make America Great Again” – which was Donald Trump‘s slogan during the 2016 US presidential campaign.

Smollett has starred in Fox TV’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul.

Police confirmed the actor took himself to Chicago’s Northwestern Hospital and “is in good condition”.

In a statement, Chicago Police Department said: “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”

Support from stars

Following the attack, Ariana Grande was among other celebrities to offer words of support.

Grande said the incident left her “sick to my stomach” and sent, “all of the healing energy / love I possibly can and hoping for change”.

Grande added: “What can we do ? tell me & i’m there”.

Kevin Hart, who stepped down from his role as Oscars host after historical homophobic tweets surfaced, also sent Smollett a message of support.

He wrote on Instagram: “Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better.”

No response from the President yet

US president Trump is yet to comment, despite pressure to do so. Earlier, Empire creator Lee Daniels reacted to the attack by saying “America is better than that”.

In an emotional video posted to Instagram, Daniels called Smollett his “son”, before calling for change.

He said: “It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.”

As well as his acting, Smollett is also a singer and activist who has advocated HIV/Aids prevention."

American actor Jussie Smollett has been met with an outpouring of support from A-Listers such as supermodel Naomi Campbell and Oscar winner Viola Davis, after he suffered a vicious attack.

The 35-year-old Empire star was the victim of a suspected racist and homophobic assault.

The Mighty Ducks star was punched by two men in the face and had an unknown chemical substance on him, police have said.

Jussie also had a rope tied around his neck by one of his attackers, before the two fled the scene in the early hours of Tuesday.

TMZ has reported Smollett has now been released from hospital and his condition is said to be “good”.

The horrific incident took place at East Lower Water Street, Chicago, at approximately 2am local time when Smollett was leaving a restaurant.

A police statement said: “Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.

“At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.”

Cops are appealing for witnesses to come forward with any video footage of the incident.

Smollett – who plays gay musician Jamal Lyon in Empire – posted on social media just hours before the attack.

Taking to his Instagram page, he revealed he was sleepy following landing in Chicago after “seven hours on a plane for a two hour flight”.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)

With Joanie Greve

THE BIG IDEA: Two long years ago, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi tapped former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear to deliver their party’s response to President Trump’s first State of the Union address. He was a 72-year-old white male moderate from a small town at a moment when Democrats were fixated on how they got whupped so badly in rural areas. Bill Clinton carried the Bluegrass State in 1996, but Hillary Clinton garnered less than 33 percent of the vote two decades later. Seated at a table in an old-fashioned diner, Beshear opened with a gaffe. “I’m a proud Democrat, but first and foremost, I’m a proud Republican, and Democrat, and mostly, American,” he said.

Chuck and Nancy have picked another Southerner to deliver the 2019 response, but she’s different in almost every way. And that reflects the mood of the moment in Democratic politics. Stacey Abrams, 45, last year became the first black woman ever nominated by a major party for governor. The former minority leader in the Georgia state House is unapologetically liberal, even though she’s from a red state. While Beshear went to a state school, Abrams earned her law degree from Yale. Beshear has been married for 50 years and has two grown kids; Abrams, who is single, has never been married and has no children. He’s mild-mannered; she’s fiery.

“I plan to deliver a vision for prosperity and equality, where everyone in our nation has a voice and where each of those voices is heard,” Abrams said in a statement.

-- The shift from Steve to Stacey, with Joe Kennedy III in between, is a nod by party chieftains to what they perceive as growing grass-roots hunger for fresh faces of color who are young and female.

“We were sitting around thinking about this three weeks ago, and her name came up. Immediately, everyone in the room said, ‘Let’s do it,’” Schumer (D-N.Y.) told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “She’s an amazing person with an amazing story.”

Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Abrams “embodies the American Dream.” “Her electrifying message of courage, perseverance and hope reinvigorated our nation and our politics, and continues to inspire millions of Americans in every part of the country,” the speaker said.

-- Abrams has emerged as an avatar of the resistance movement. “Abrams has refused to cede defeat in the governor’s race since ending her campaign on Nov. 17 with a defiant speech blaming her loss on voting irregularities. She received 48.8 percent of the vote to Brian Kemp’s 50.2 percent,” Vanessa Williams noted in a feature story about her last week. “Instead, Abrams announced a new organization, Fair Fight Georgia, focused on battling voter suppression. The group filed a federal lawsuit against state elections officials, alleging that they ‘grossly mismanaged’ the 2018 election and violated Georgians’ constitutional and civil rights. State officials have until the end of the month to respond to the suit.”

-- 2018 was another Year of the Woman, and 2020 may be as well. Exit polls showed a historic gender gap, with women favoring Democrats by 19 points and men favoring Republicans by four points. The first three Democratic senators to launch presidential campaigns are female. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) toppled a white guy who was twice her age, and No. 4 in party leadership, in a Democratic primary last summer. Still only 29, AOC has emerged as the unofficial leader of a freshman class that includes 40 women.

“Picking a black woman to deliver this speech is a powerful statement about where the Democratic Party is and where the nation is,” Democratic strategist Karine Jean-Pierre told Eugene Scott. “The contrast with Trump could not be more stark.”

-- One reason Schumer picked Abrams is that he wants her to run for Senate next year against Republican incumbent David Perdue. The minority leader made the case to Abrams during a meeting last month in Washington. If she got in, Democratic odds of winning control of the upper chamber would increase. At the very least, Republicans would be forced to spends tens of millions more to hold the seat than they would otherwise.

Abrams says she will run for office again, but she’s not sure which one. She’s given herself until the end of March to decide about the Senate. If she doesn’t do it, she’d likely be on shortlists of vice-presidential picks in the summer of 2020. If a Democrat defeats Trump, she could be a prime candidate for a spot in anyone’s Cabinet in 2021. She could also challenge the governor in a 2022 rematch.

Last week, on MLK day, Abrams launched a statewide tour in Albany, Ga., to thank people who supported her in 2018. A poll released the Friday before last by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that 52 percent of registered Georgia voters view her favorably. Kemp’s approval rating is only 37 percent.

-- Trump claimed last fall that Abrams was “not qualified” to lead a state, even though she has more governing experience than he did when he became president. The president also warned at a pre-election rally in Macon that Georgia would “turn into Venezuela” if she won.

Responding to yesterday’s announcement, the Republican National Committee called Abrams a loser who is in a “never-ending pursuit of the public limelight.” RNC spokeswoman Ellie Hockenbury said in a statement: “While Chuck Schumer may feel her agenda would be a good fit for national Democrats, it’s worth remembering that it wasn’t even a good fit for her fellow Georgians who rejected her bid for governor just last year.”

-- Abrams won’t just be the first black woman to give the official State of the Union response, a tradition that began in 1966. She’ll also be the first person to do so who does not currently hold elected office. Vox editor Ezra Klein observes that some of the biggest Democratic stars coming out of 2018 lost their races, including Abrams, Beto O’Rourke and Andrew Gillum.

What's made it different this year? Is it just where the political talent happened to fall in the election? Or something about how the party and media have changed? — Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) January 29, 2019

-- Speaking on the Senate floor yesterday, Schumer also said that he read “with interest” the Daily 202’s coverage from the Koch network’s “touchy-feely” donor meeting. “I hope it’s not sort of just a fig leaf because they’re getting such bad publicity and America is moving so far away from what they believe,” the Democratic leader said.

“Color me skeptical,” he continued. “The Koch brothers may sit out the presidential contest, as they did in 2016, but their political arm, Americans for Prosperity, continues to support candidates who are divisive, who do not bring us together. Some of the ads you see, the very candidates they support, are dividing us. You can’t on the one hand say you want to bring us together and on the other use your political arm to tear us apart. … They support the kinds of judges who agree with them on all the corporate stuff, that don’t want regulation and who are against voting rights. How does that bring us together?”

Koch network spokesman James Davis replies: “People are tired of the politics of division. We are committed to uniting with anyone to do right, just like we did on criminal justice reform and Right to Try legislation. Let’s come together on a solution for immigration.”

-- The government is operating on a three-hour delay because of the wintry weather. Many of the D.C. region’s schools are also opening late or closing their doors today. Here is the full list.

-- The wind chill could dip below zero in Washington today. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: “The truly bitter blast isn’t here quite yet. But it’s still a cold winter day with morning temperatures rising into and through the 20s — watch out for icy spots — and afternoon highs in the upper 20s to mid-30s. … Partly sunny morning skies turn mostly cloudy late morning into the afternoon, when a few snow showers could put down a quick coating in spots. … The bitter cold and dry air pour in as evening temperatures drop like a rock through the 20s and teens. Most spots should see lows in the single digits, maybe all the way down to near zero in our coldest north and west suburbs, and perhaps holding up near 10 degrees downtown.”

-- Meanwhile, the Midwest is facing a historically cold polar vortex that has already been blamed for one death in Minnesota. Katie Mettler, Christopher Ingraham, Samantha Schmidt and Angela Fritz report: “It has caused statewide declarations of emergency, school closures, Postal Service interruptions and 1,000 airline flight cancellations across the country. Wind chill estimates plummeted to minus-50 in the Dakotas and northern Minnesota on Tuesday morning, and that same, painfully frigid air is forecast to spread southeast into Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago and Detroit. Winds will make it feel like temperatures of minus-30 to minus-40 as far south as Illinois and northern Indiana; it is forecast to feel as low as minus-65 across the northern Great Lakes region.”

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted in Chicago in an attack that police are investigating as a “possible racially charged assault and battery.” The Chicago Police Department said in a statement that Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was confronted by “two unknown offenders [who] approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him.” The attackers poured an “unknown chemical substance” on Smollett and at one point wrapped a noose around his neck.

CARACAS ON THE BRINK:

-- Venezuelan authorities froze the bank accounts of self-declared interim president Juan Guaidó and sought to block him from leaving the country as President Nicolás Maduro tries to quash the most legitimate threat yet to his power. Andreina Aponte, Rachelle Krygier and Anthony Faiola report: “Maduro’s chief prosecutor made the request, which was later ratified by the loyalist Supreme Court as a preventative measure pending a full investigation. The move stopped short of a detention order — something the Trump administration has strongly warned against. … Speaking at the opposition-led National Assembly, which he heads, Guaidó responded to the move by dismissing it as ‘nothing new under the sun.’ He said it came from ‘a regime that doesn’t give answers to Venezuelans’ and whose ‘only answer is persecution and repression.’ Guaidó added: ‘The world is clear on what’s happening in Venezuela. … Let’s not desist because of threats and persecution.’

“The United States, which backs Guaidó as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, pushed back hard against the chief prosecutor’s effort. ‘We denounce the illegitimate former Venezuelan Attorney General’s threats against President Juan Guaido,’ White House national security adviser John Bolton wrote on Twitter. ‘Let me reiterate—there will be serious consequences for those who attempt to subvert democracy and harm Guaido.’”

-- Trump tweeted this morning: “Americans should not travel to Venezuela until further notice.”

-- Maduro is attempting to clamp down on the opposition by unleashing increasingly aggressive police tactics against dissidents. Mariana Zuñiga and Anthony Faiola report: “As the opposition campaign to oust him dramatically escalated, the warren-like streets of the Puerta Caracas slum filled with pot-banging, anti-government demonstrators. A culture center run by Maduro loyalists was burned down. Hungry, beaten-down residents felt a rush of hope. Then night fell, along with the boot steps of government forces. Maduro called the arsonists 'fascist criminals,' and residents in the western Caracas enclave paid the price. Mask-wearing special forces, locals said, swarmed the neighborhood last week, kicking in doors, rounding up young people and imposing an effective curfew. … Over the past week, similar operations have extended to at least five other rebellious slums across the capital, leaving 35 people dead — including victims as young as 16 — and more than 850 arrested.”

-- Critics of the Trump White House say Bolton’s display of a note indicating the possible deployment of U.S. troops to Colombia is indicative of the administration’s careless handling of sensitive matters. From David Nakamura: “Revealing private notes, including [President George W.] Bush’s request for a ‘bathroom break’ at the United Nations in 2005, have bedeviled past presidents — but rarely with the frequency of the Trump White House. Obama’s White House photographer, Pete Souza, occasionally posted photos of marked-up presidential addresses, but those were carefully curated to cast the president as a thoughtful writer and editor. Bolton’s appearance in the briefing room — just days after photographers snapped senior aide Stephen Miller’s notes, including the underlined term ‘Radical Democrats,’ during a White House meeting — was something of a flashback to the earliest days of the administration.”

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. (Valery Sharifulin/AFP/Getty Images)

THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- Russia attempted to interfere last year in U.S.-North Korean nuclear negotiations by offering Pyongyang a nuclear power plant in exchange for destroying its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. John Hudson and Ellen Nakashima report: “The Russian offer, which intelligence officials became aware of in late 2018, marked a new attempt by Moscow to intervene in the high-stakes nuclear talks as it reasserts itself in a string of geopolitical flash points from the Middle East to South Asia to Latin America. It’s unclear how [Trump] will view Moscow’s proposal. For months, he has embraced an unorthodox approach to the negotiations, but his aides are likely to strenuously oppose any major Russian role in a final agreement.”

-- Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin for several minutes during November’s G-20 summit without a note-taker or translator from the U.S. side, according to the Financial Times’s James Politi, Demetri Sevastopulo and Henry Foy. “The discussions between the US and Russian presidents occurred at the 19th-century Colón theatre in the Argentine capital, as world leaders and their spouses or guests were streaming out of the building. Mr Trump was accompanied by Melania Trump, his wife, but no staff, while Mr Putin was flanked by his translator. The four of them sat at a table and were among the last to leave. … Mr Trump’s aides characterised the Putin encounter as one of several ‘informal’ conversations that Mr Trump had with his counterparts that evening.

“The accounts of people familiar with the conversation said it appeared longer and more substantive than the White House has acknowledged. According to a Russian government official’s account, the two leaders spoke for about 15 minutes about a number of foreign policy issues, including the Azov Sea incident and the conflict in Syria. They also discussed when they could have a formal meeting, the official said. Mr Trump explained that a full meeting with Mr Putin was impossible at the time, and the Russian leader responded by saying he ‘was not in a hurry’ and remained ready to meet when it suited Mr Trump best, the Russian official said.”

-- Moscow is advancing a plan to stop punishing officials for “unavoidable” bribes. The Moscow Times reports: “Putin proposed the measure in an anti-corruption plan signed in June 2018 that called for legislation that would allow officials to escape prosecution for corruption under ‘exceptional circumstances.’ … The amendments drafted by the Justice Ministry seek to exempt officials from legal accountability when corruption is unavoidable. ‘In certain circumstances, complying with restrictions and bans ... to prevent or settle conflicts of interests … is impossible for objective reasons,’ the draft bill on the government's legal portal says.”

-- Split-screen: Leaders of the intelligence community, all appointed by Trump, said Russia and China represent two of the most significant national security threats during Senate testimony in which they repeatedly offered assessments starkly at odds with the president’s public posturing. Shane Harris reports: “The two U.S. adversaries ‘are more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s,’ Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats said in his prepared remarks before the Senate Intelligence Committee. ... The countries have expanded cooperation in the energy sector over the past half decade; influenced international bodies that set rules and standards, particularly around communications technology; and will collaborate on the shared goal of ‘taking advantage of rising doubts in some places about the liberal democratic model,’ Coats warned. CIA Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and other top officials joined Coats.” (They were there to discuss the new National Intelligence Strategy, which I wrote about last week.)

-- Here are five of the main issues where the intelligence community leaders broke with Trump:

Coats “said that North Korea was ‘unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capabilities,’ which the country’s leaders consider ‘critical to the regime’s survival.’ That assessment threw cold water on the White House’s more optimistic view that the United States and North Korea will achieve a lasting peace and that the regime will ultimately give up its nuclear weapons.’” “None of the officials said there is a security crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, where Trump has considered declaring a national emergency so that he can build a wall.” “Officials also warned that the Islamic State was capable of attacking the United States and painted a picture of a still-formidable organization. Trump has declared the group defeated and has said he wants to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria as a result.” “The officials assessed that the government of Iran was not trying to build a nuclear weapon, despite the Trump administration’s persistent claims that the country has been violating the terms of an international agreement forged during the Obama administration. Officials told lawmakers that Iran was in compliance with the agreement.” “Officials also warned, as they did last year, about Russia’s intention to interfere with the U.S. political system. … Trump continues to equivocate on whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf, contradicting the unanimous assessment of all the top intelligence officials currently serving.”

-- “The disconnect between [Trump] and the Republican establishment on foreign policy has rarely been as stark,” the New York Times’s Peter Baker notes. “In recent days, the president’s own advisers and allies have been pushing back, challenging his view of the world and his prescription for its problems. The growing discontent among Republican national security hawks was most evident on Tuesday when [Mitch McConnell] effectively rebuked the president by introducing a measure denouncing ‘a precipitous withdrawal’ of American troops from Syria and Afghanistan.”

THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Roger Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges laid out by special counsel Bob Mueller. Spencer S. Hsu, Ann E. Marimow and Devlin Barrett report: “He faces charges of lying, obstruction and witness tampering. Asked Tuesday whether he would consider pardoning Stone, [Trump] told The Washington Post, ‘I have not given it any thought.’ … As Stone walked into the courthouse Tuesday morning, some onlookers chanted ‘lock him up!’ while others screamed their support for him and the president. After he went inside the courthouse, some of those people engaged in profanity-laced arguments about the case. … In the courtroom Tuesday, prosecutors said the Stone case would be tried jointly by Mueller’s office and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and asked for no change to the terms of Stone’s release set by a Florida judge Friday. … The judge agreed with those conditions and scheduled the next court hearing for Feb. 1.”

-- The Senate Judiciary Committee’s planned vote on William Barr’s nomination as attorney general was delayed amid Democratic concerns about how he would handle the Mueller probe. Karoun Demirjian reports: “The delay, which is customary for high-profile nominations, is not expected to impede Barr’s chances of being confirmed by the full Senate. But it is the latest reflection of the deep partisan tension surrounding Barr’s nomination, most of which centers on Democrats’ desire to protect Mueller’s probe from being unduly constrained. The committee was scheduled to vote on 46 nominations on Tuesday, including Barr’s, but decided to delay until Feb. 7.”

-- House Democrats raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest in Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin’s decision to lift sanctions on the businesses of Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The New York Times’s Kenneth P. Vogel reports: “In a letter to Mr. Mnuchin, two senior Democratic lawmakers said the Treasury secretary’s connection to an entertainment business owned in part by [a billionaire Republican] donor, Len Blavatnik, a major investor in Mr. Deripaska’s giant aluminum company, Rusal, was a potential conflict of interest. … Tony Sayegh, the Treasury Department’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said that Mr. Mnuchin had ‘no business relationship’ with Mr. Blavatnik and that any implication of a conflict of interest or ethical problem was ‘absurd.’”

-- The Justice Department's inspector general wants to investigate Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta’s role in securing a cushy plea deal for alleged serial sex offender Jeffrey Epstein while Acosta was serving as a federal prosecutor in Florida. But he's currently barred from doing so. Bloomberg Law’s Chris Opfer and Jaclyn Diaz report: “‘Your letter raises important questions about the resolution of this case by department attorneys,’ DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz said in a Jan. 29 letter to lawmakers. ‘However, the OIG does not currently have jurisdiction over matters involving allegations of misconduct relating to DOJ attorneys’ handling of litigation or legal decisions.’ … Horowitz called on the Senate to take up a bill (H.R. 202) recently passed by the House. He said that legislation would give him the authority to investigate alleged prosecutorial misconduct.”

-- The first meeting of the new House Oversight Committee, which will oversee investigations of the Trump administration, featured fireworks between Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Bloomberg News’s Billy House reports: “Meadows and other Republicans were telling Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland that members should get more than three days’ notice to attend questioning of witnesses by Democratic staff lawyers. Meadows said five days was better, particularly for lawmakers who live far from Washington. Ocasio-Cortez wasted no time in offering her first remarks on the committee. ‘I don’t believe we need five days’ if lawmakers are doing their jobs, she responded. Meadows wasn’t going to let that go. Formally directing his remarks to Cummings, he responded: ‘Mr. Chairman, I can tell you on all of this at this particular point, we’re all wanting to cooperate.’ But he said, ‘Sometimes our schedules, you know, we’re not just sitting around eating bonbons, waiting for the call of anybody.’ Ocasio-Cortez then asked Cummings whether Republicans gave members ample notice for such matters during the last congressional session, when they ran the committee. ‘No,’ said Cummings, of Maryland. ‘OK, thank you,’ said Ocasio-Cortez.”

THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- The Trump Organization plans to verify employees’ immigration status following a Post report that one of the president’s golf clubs hired undocumented immigrants for years. Jonathan O'Connell, Elise Viebeck and Tracy Jan report: “‘We are instituting E-Verify on all of our properties as soon as possible,’ Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said Tuesday, acknowledging that the company currently uses the program only at some locations. … The move is the first acknowledgment by the president’s private business that it has failed to fully check the work status of all its employees, despite Trump’s claims during the 2016 campaign that he used E-Verify across his properties. At the time, he called for the program to be mandatory for all employers. The decision by the Trump Organization is not likely to head off calls for an investigation by congressional Democrats, who on Tuesday began gathering signatures for a letter to FBI Director [Wray] seeking a probe into whether the president’s company broke the law by hiring undocumented workers.”

-- The United States started instituting its new policy of forcing asylum seekers at the southern border to wait in Mexico as their cases are processed. Maya Averbuch and Kevin Sieff report: “Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen planned to visit the San Ysidro port of entry later in the day to ‘assess implementation’ of the new approach, according to a DHS statement. … The return of [a] Honduran asylum seeker Tuesday appeared to be ad hoc; he was rushed to a van by a Mexican immigration agent with no formal announcement of when ­others would follow. Rodulfo Figueroa, the national migration agency’s representative in Tijuana, said no others would be released Tuesday.”

-- The Pentagon intends to send thousands more U.S. troops to the southern border. Dan Lamothe reports: “Acting defense secretary Patrick M. Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon that the evolving mission will focus heavily on watching the border for potential threats. It will mark the latest shift in how active-duty troops are used on the border, and nudge the number from about 2,300 active-duty service members closer to a high-water mark of about 5,900 that were involved in November. An additional 2,300 national guardsmen also are deployed to the border mission.”

-- Following the shutdown, Democrats have taken a rare polling lead over Trump on border security. From Aaron Blake: “A new Quinnipiac University poll finds Americans trust Democrats more than Trump on border security, 50 percent to 41 percent. That is up from a 49-to-44 Democratic advantage two weeks ago. Both findings are rare since the issue has almost always favored the GOP. As recently as November, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found people favored Republicans to Democrats on the issue of border security by nearly the opposite margin, 49 to 39.”

A SECOND SHUTDOWN?

-- Republican lawmakers proposed a debt-ceiling increase as one component of a possible deal in their frantic efforts to avoid another government shutdown. Robert Costa and Erica Werner report: “The latest idea to tack on an increase in the nation’s borrowing limit to discussions over Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall divided Republicans and was immediately rejected by Democrats, a less-than-promising development on the eve of congressional negotiators’ first meeting. ‘I don’t want to sink the whole thing,’ Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said when asked about the flurry of proposals by her colleagues. Still, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, and others worked to nudge a bipartisan group of lawmakers toward including a debt-limit hike, hoping to avoid another shutdown in mid-February when funding expires as well as a market-rattling showdown over the nation’s debt. …

“Most Republicans are now eager to avoid another shutdown, due to the political fallout they have endured in polls, which show a majority of Americans blaming Trump and the GOP for the standoff. [Mitch McConnell], who has been cautious, said Tuesday, ‘I’m for whatever works, which means avoiding a shutdown and avoiding the president feeling he should declare a national emergency.’ … The suggestions — which also included spending restrictions and protections for young undocumented immigrants as part of a broader pact — complicated the path ahead for the committee of 17 lawmakers charged with coming up with a spending deal to stave off another shutdown Feb. 15.”

-- The lowest-paid government contractors are still feeling the impact of the first shutdown. Danielle Paquette reports: “Unlike the 800,000 career public servants who are slated to receive full back pay over the next week or so, the contractors who clean, guard, cook and shoulder other jobs at federal workplaces aren’t legally guaranteed a single penny. They’re also among the lowest-paid laborers in the government economy, generally earning between $450 and $650 weekly, union leaders say. … Héctor Figueroa, president of 32BJ SEIU, a labor union that represents 170,000 service workers on the East Coast, said reopening the government is a temporary fix for people on such shaky ground.”

-- Officials at Mount Rainier National Park worked to cut through five weeks’ worth of snow that built up during the shutdown. Lornet Turnbull reports: “It’s likely to take at least two days to clear, leaving huge snowbanks around the perimeter. Road crews and other staff members at Mount Rainier National Park are scrambling to reopen this iconic volcanic mountain to the public, more than a month after the partial federal government shutdown cut off official access to some of its most popular wintertime activities. The park lost 10 percent of its working year, Superintendent Chip Jenkins laments. And while Paradise might begin welcoming visitors by next weekend, there is bigger concern about the long-term effect those lost days could have on the crucial summer season.”

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti speaks during a news conference in Los Angeles. (Jae C. Hong/AP)

2020 WATCH:

-- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that he would not seek the Democratic presidential nomination. The LA Times’s Michael Finnegan and Dakota Smith report: “After nearly two years of flirting with the idea that he could leap from City Hall to the world’s most powerful job, the mild-mannered mayor reached a decision in keeping with his reputation for avoiding political risk. He also passed up a chance to run for governor last year when the odds seemed stacked against him. At a City Hall news conference, Garcetti said he decided over the last couple of weeks to stay put as mayor because he ‘realized that this is what I am meant to do and this is where I want to be.’”

-- One possible beneficiary of Garcetti’s decision: Sen. Kamala Harris, who may now become the only high-profile presidential candidate from California. From the San Francisco Chronicle’s Joe Garofoli: “Since California’s primary will be held on March 3, 2020 — far earlier in than in many past election cycles — it could have an outsized impact on whom the party’s nominee will be. ‘It’s always easy to be the favorite daughter when there’s no favorite son,’ said Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at UC San Diego and author of ‘The New Political Geography of California.’ ‘If I were Kamala, I’d be giddy,’ said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a retired professor of public policy communication at the University of Southern California. Among other things, ‘Harris and Garcetti were hitting a lot of the same Democratic donors,’ she said.”

-- Harris’s acknowledgement that Medicare-for-all would also mean private insurance for none underscores the risks for 2020 Democrats who have chosen to embrace it. Annie Linskey reports on the fallout: “In a single flourish, Harris drew attention to the fact that the Medicare-for-all plans backed by 16 senators — including five potential candidates for the Democratic nomination — would in effect remove private health insurance from the estimated 251 million Americans who use it, broadly disrupting the industry and the way Americans experience the medical system. …

“Candidates can point to evidence that there’s popular support for the idea. Fifty-six percent of respondents backed a Medicare-for-all plan, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey. … But enthusiasm for the idea plummets when respondents are told the plan would largely eliminate private health insurance companies: Only 37 percent favor eliminating private insurance. And nearly 70 percent of those surveyed in a Gallup report released in December said they think their health coverage is either ‘good’ or ‘excellent.’”

-- Harris’s team tried to clean up the senator's comments. CNN’s Gregory Krieg, Tami Luhby and Maeve Reston report: “A Harris adviser on Tuesday signaled that the candidate would also be open to the more moderate health reform plans, which would preserve the industry, being floated by other congressional Democrats ... Both the adviser and Harris national press secretary Ian Sams said her willingness to consider alternate routes to a single payer system should not cast doubt on her commitment to the policy.”

-- “The unique harm we cause when we dissect a powerful woman’s love life,” by Monica Hesse: “The candidate in question [Harris], whose past relationship with former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown was confirmed for the national media when Brown published an op-ed: Yes, they’d dated. And, yes, he ‘may have influenced her career’ by appointing her to two commissions. … The two things were separate, according to Brown. 1) They dated. 2) He helped her career. The latter didn’t have anything to do with the former. Whether you believe that probably depends on whether you believe one can separate someone’s professional qualifications from their dinner companionship. … [I]t’s not that we don’t talk about the sexual predilections of male candidates. But we do talk about them in a different way. We talk about men abusing power. We talk about women not even deserving power. The distinction matters, because the conversation isn’t really about sex, it’s about legitimacy.”

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) greets supporters in Honolulu. (Marco Garcia/AP)

-- Rep. Tulsi Gabbard’s presidential campaign has already spiraled out of control, and the vanity project now threatens to cost the Hawaii Democrat her House seat. Politico’s Daniel Strauss and Alex Thompson report: “Two-and-a-half weeks after she told CNN she had decided to run for the White House—an announcement that even her own staff didn't know was coming, after weeks of debating the timing of the rollout—the 37-year-old congresswoman has struggled to contain the chaos. Campaign manager Rania Batrice and Gabbard’s consulting firm Revolution Messaging are set to depart after this weekend’s official kickoff in Hawaii … Meanwhile, the congresswoman is under fire back home after picking a fight with Sen. Mazie Hirono (D), and a prominent Democratic state lawmaker is already challenging Gabbard in next year’s congressional primary. That means she faces the possibility of losing the presidential race and her House seat as well.”

-- Howard Schultz is facing intense blowback over his potential independent presidential campaign. But the former Starbucks CEO has spent months preparing the unconventional bid. Michael Scherer reports: “[Schultz deployed] more than six national polls and [laid] the groundwork for paid advertising that could debut in the next two months. The full reach of the project suggests that his stated goal of disrupting the U.S. political process is not likely to fade away anytime soon, despite enormous historical barriers to success and Democratic predictions that his entry in the race will help [Trump] get reelected. An early advertising effort, made possible by Schultz’s net worth of about $3.4 billion, would be designed to help Schultz show early promise in national polls during his book tour, which he has described as a time to test the appeal of his ideas.”

-- Schultz further attracted Democratic ire by belittling the policy positions of Elizabeth Warren, Harris and Ocasio-Cortez. John Wagner reports: “During an interview Tuesday on NPR’s ‘Morning Edition,’ Schultz, a billionaire, said that Warren’s plan for a special 2 percent annual tax on Americans whose net worth exceeds $50 million is ‘ridiculous.’ … The exchange came just a few hours after Schultz called Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) ‘a bit misinformed’ and pushed back on her idea of a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent. … Schultz also knocked the views of a policy adviser to Ocasio-Cortez as ‘un-American.’” Schultz also referred to Harris’s comments on “Medicare-for-all” as “not American.”

-- Former senator Jeff Flake ruled out a possible primary challenge against Trump in 2020. “I have always said that I do hope that there is a Republican who challenges the president in the primary,” Flake told “CBS This Morning.” “I still hope that somebody does, but that somebody won’t be me. I will not be a candidate.” (John Wagner)

WEST WING INTRIGUE:

-- Trump lashed out against former White House aide Cliff Sims and may have inadvertently helped sell more copies of Sims’s new book. CNN’s Brian Stelter reports: “‘A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction,’ Trump said in his tweet. … At the time of the Tuesday morning tweet, ‘Team of Vipers’ was No. 12 on Amazon's best selling books list. The rankings are updated every hour. ‘Vipers’ has been moving up the list ever since, and as of Tuesday afternoon, it stands at No. 6. Of course, it's impossible to know how much of the sales momentum is due to Trump, and how much is due to other factors like Sims' TV appearances. … But Trump's post triggered a brand new news cycle about Sims' depictions of a distracted president and a distrustful inner circle of aides.”

-- Sims pushed back against claims he was fired from his role. The New York Times’s Annie Karni and Maggie Haberman report: “Anticipating pushback from the White House, he told George Stephanopoulos, the host [of ‘Good Morning America’], that he had brought his resignation letter along to prove it. White House aides have been telling reporters for weeks that Mr. Sims was fired, but did not want to comment about him on the record. A former official noted that Mr. Sims was ‘instructed to leave due to a major security breach’ — a reference to what Mr. Sims said was the time he recorded [Trump] in the White House on his government phone and then emailed those files to himself, but insisted that was not the reason he left.”

-- In an interview with the New Yorker, Sims said he was still “proud” of working for the Trump administration and seemed largely unfazed by Trump’s most controversial positions. Of birtherism, Sims said, “I think that’s, like, a great example of a time where he does not step up to the plate and take on these race issues in an appropriate way, a helpful way for the country.” When asked whether he would have left the administration during the implementation of migrant family separations, Sims replied, “I don’t know. Maybe. Maybe.” He added when discussing the Charlottesville fallout, “I really don’t think there is a racist bone in [Trump’s] body.” (New Yorker)

-- Chris Christie, who is on his own book tour, described Jared Kushner as the most influential person in the White House. “He's not the only person who [Trump] listens to, but I don't think anyone has more influence than Jared has,” the former New Jersey governor told NPR.

SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:

Trump laid out his foreign policy vision and contradicted intelligence community officials’ comments before a Senate panel on North Korea:

When I became President, ISIS was out of control in Syria & running rampant. Since then tremendous progress made, especially over last 5 weeks. Caliphate will soon be destroyed, unthinkable two years ago. Negotiating are proceeding well in Afghanistan after 18 years of fighting.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2019

....Fighting continues but the people of Afghanistan want peace in this never ending war. We will soon see if talks will be successful? North Korea relationship is best it has ever been with U.S. No testing, getting remains, hostages returned. Decent chance of Denuclearization... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2019

...Time will tell what will happen with North Korea, but at the end of the previous administration, relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen. Now a whole different story. I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un shortly. Progress being made-big difference! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2019

He also demanded that any deal proposed by the bipartisan committee working to avoid another shutdown must include a border wall:

If the committee of Republicans and Democrats now meeting on Border Security is not discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier, they are Wasting their time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2019

A government agency corrected Trump's false tweet about climate change:

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) struck back against Howard Schultz's criticism of her policy proposals:

What's “ridiculous” is billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else.

• Kamala Harris' Medicare for All proposal

• Critics of third-party campaigns — ryan teague beckwith (@ryanbeckwith) January 29, 2019

From an Atlantic editor:

It's one thing to disagree w/proposals-lots of Dems consider Medicare-for-All the wrong direction-but calling policy ideas ""not American"" and ""un-American"" echoes conservative arguments against progressives' loyalty to US. Its language one would expect from Trump not a ""centrist"" https://t.co/6hp0MXOIMZ — Ronald Brownstein (@RonBrownstein) January 30, 2019

The damage is mounting from these fundamental changes, and Americans are living it. These are their stories.”

-- “I was ambassador to Afghanistan. This deal is a surrender,” by Ryan Crocker: “This current process bears an unfortunate resemblance to the Paris peace talks during the Vietnam War. Then, as now, it was clear that by going to the table we were surrendering; we were just negotiating the terms of our surrender. The Taliban will offer any number of commitments, knowing that when we are gone and the Taliban is back, we will have no means of enforcing any of them.”

-- Greenville News, “Taken: How police departments make millions by seizing property,” by Anna Lee and Nathaniel Cary and Mike Ellis: “The TAKEN team scoured more than 3,200 forfeiture cases and spoke to dozens of targeted citizens plus more than 50 experts and officials. Additionally, the team contacted every law enforcement agency in the state. This yielded a clear picture of what is happening: Police are systematically seizing cash and property — many times from people who aren’t guilty of a crime — netting millions of dollars each year. South Carolina law enforcement profits from this policing tactic: the bulk of the money ends up in its possession. … These seizures leave thousands of citizens without their cash and belongings or reliable means to get them back. They target black men most, our investigation found — with crushing consequences when life savings or a small business payroll is taken.”

HOT ON THE LEFT: “Texas quietly informs counties that some of the 95,000 voters flagged for citizenship review don’t belong on the list,” from Alexa Ura: “After flagging tens of thousands of registered voters for citizenship reviews, the Texas secretary of state’s office is now telling counties that some of those voters don’t belong on the lists it sent out. Officials in five large counties — Harris, Travis, Fort Bend, Collin and Williamson — told the Texas Tribune they had received calls Tuesday from the secretary of state’s office indicating that some of the voters whose citizenship status the state said counties should consider checking should not actually be on those lists. The secretary of state’s office incorrectly included some voters who had submitted their voting registration applications at Texas Department of Public Safety offices, according to county officials. Now, the secretary of state is instructing counties to remove them from the list of flagged voters.” HOT ON THE RIGHT: “Dems to strike 'so help you God' from oath taken in front of key House committee, draft shows,” from Fox News: “A key committee in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives is moving to eliminate the God reference from the oath administered to witnesses testifying before the panel, as part of a new rules package expected to be approved this week, according to a draft obtained exclusively by Fox News. The draft shows that the House Committee on Natural Resources would ask witnesses to recite only, ‘Do you solemnly swear or affirm, under penalty of law, that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?’ The rules proposal places the words ‘so help you God’ in red brackets, indicating they are slated to be cut. … The draft rules also remove the phrase ‘his or her’ throughout the document, changing those two pronouns to ‘their.’”

NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:

-- The Wizards lost to the Cavaliers 116-113. (Candace Buckner)

-- Federal prosecutors argued that Daron Wint, convicted of killing the Savopoulos family and their housekeeper, should receive a life sentence without parole. Keith L. Alexander reports: “Wint, 37, who was convicted this fall on 20 counts including first-degree murder, kidnapping and arson, is scheduled to be sentenced Friday in D.C. Superior Court.”

­-- The Federal Transit Administration warned Metro that it could suffer financially if it restores late-night service. From Robert McCartney: “In a letter sent this month, the FTA said it may have to postpone certifying a new Metro safety oversight agency if late-night service is extended. That would further delay the lifting of FTA sanctions that have held up millions in federal transportation funds to the District, Maryland and Virginia. The FTA’s warning adds to pressure on Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and Metro Board Chairman Jack Evans to drop their insistence on extending service hours, especially on weekends. The District says restoring late-night service is vital to support the city’s restaurants, clubs and other nightlife.”

-- An investigation found that a private Maryland school fostered a “toxic culture” that allowed for the alleged sexual abuse of young girls in the 1970s. Justin Wm. Moyer reports: “The Key School in Annapolis launched the investigation after a former student said she was abused by two Key teachers starting when she was 13 and similar accounts were shared on social media. Seven former students interviewed by The Washington Post in an article last year said they were abused while enrolled at the school. The investigation, which the Key School launched in February 2018, concluded that faculty members, administrators and board members who were aware of the abuse chose not to intervene and failed to protect students. The report does not allege any recent incidents at the school.”

Police did not release the actor’s name but a statement from Fox, which airs Empire, identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime. Smollett is black and openly gay.

According to a police statement, the actor was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an “unknown substance” on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that when officers first came in contact with Smollett, he still had a rope around his neck. While being interviewed by detectives, Guglielmi said Smollett told them that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The police spokesman added that the two men were wearing masks. Investigators have not found any surveillance video or witnesses from which they can put together a description of the offenders, he said.

Smollett was able to take himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was last reported in good condition.

Guglielmi also said the FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago last week.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Tuesday in support of Smollett. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence,” the statement read. Empire co-creator Lee Daniels also voiced his support for Smollett in an Instagram video: “You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck. You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.”

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

“He is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I’ve ever met,” Harris said Tuesday, adding that she’s still learning more details about the incident. Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues and he released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

To attack a defenseless person shows how much of a coward and how truly weak you really are. But as my grandmother always said when someone did something awful and evil, “I promise you, you will reap what you sow.”

When they saw Jussie, the men – both white – yelled: “Aren’t you that faggot ‘Empire’ nigga?”

They then viciously attacked Jussie. He fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

According to Paul Kacik, a buyer for Sean Healy Presents who spoke to the Los Angeles Times, Smollet is still scheduled to perform at the famed West Hollywood venue the Troubadour on Saturday unless they “hear anything different.”

The venue’s calendar, which is current and up-to-date, also shows that the performance is still scheduled, and Smollett recently retweeted a Monday plug for the Troubadour show.

The show will come just four days after the actor, who came out as gay during a 2015 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, suffered a brutal attack while leaving a Subway restaurant in Chicago during the early morning hours of Tuesday, Jan. 30.

The actor was reportedly approached by two men wearing ski masks who began yelling racial and homophobic slurs, physically assaulted him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him believed to be bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck. Smollett stated that his attackers yelled “MAGA country,” referencing Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, as they walked away.

Citing a police spokesman, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that Smollett returned to his apartment after the attack and his manager called police. When authorities arrived, a “thin, light rope” was still around Smollett’s neck.

Under the suggestion of police, Smollett was driven to Northwestern Hospital by his manager to be treated for lacerations on his face and neck. He was later released and is said to be “mostly physically O.K.” but “more emotionally shook up.”

The Chicago Police Department stated that the attack was “a possible racially-charged assault and battery” and that it was being treated “as a possible hate crime.”

Investigators began scouring the area near the crime scene throughout Tuesday searching for external cameras and other video recording equipment that may have caught the attack in the hopes of identifying the two suspects, who have not yet been apprehended.

Just eight days prior to the incident, a letter had been sent to Fox Studios in Chicago threatening Smollett’s life. “You will die black f—,” the letter, pieced together in cut out letters, read.

In response to the attack, the Empire cast members will have armed security as production continues in Chicago. The series held an ""emotional"" production meeting Tuesday morning to inform cast and crew members of the attack on Smollett and inform them that Fox had upped security."

— ‘I love my wife but I can’t let her take away my life!’: B. Smith’s husband responds to critics—

According to The Root, a Black football player who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that many players opted out of visiting the White House based on President’s Donald Trump’s “divisive politics” and “racism.”

“Players were talking amongst each other,” he said. “Everybody was like: ‘I’m not going to that.’”

According to the outlet, only 15 of the 57 Black student athletes at Clemson took the trip to Washington to attend.

Clemson’s coaching staff allowed the players to choose if they wanted to go on the trip or not, the outlet said.

The visit was meant to celebrate the Tigers’ 44-16 win over the University of Alabama to claim college football’s national championship which is their second in the last three years. Due to the fact that the White House staff was on furlough because of the federal government’s partial shutdown, Trump claimed to have paid to have a buffet of fast food burgers and pizza from McDonald’s, Wendy’s and Domino’s Pizza. The president referred to the offerings as “Great American Food” and he said he paid for the “Hamberders” himself.

—Kamala Harris calls attack on Jussie Smollett ‘modern-day lynching’—

Many people spoke out against Trump’s buffet choice. Rev. Jessie Jackson was not a fan of the gesture.

“The national champions deserved better,” Jackson said to the Greenville News. “It was disgraceful.” “Many people felt offended by it. I felt offended by it.”

And Good Morning America/GMA Day host and former NFL star Michael Strahan offered to feed the team.

“I would like to invite the Clemson Tigers football team here for a great meal,” Strahan said on-the-air. “Come out here, everybody. Whoever can make it, we’ll hook you up with lobster …. Whatever you want, we’re gonna take care of you.”

Strahan’s cohost Sara Haines chimed in, suggesting they serve caviar to the team too.

When Haines commented that caviar can be pricey, Strahan replied, “It’s out of my pocket.” He added, “I’ve got you guys.”

Joe Galbraith, Clemson’s associate vice president for strategic communications, acknowledged the missing Black players in a statement Tuesday: “We had 76 student-athletes (approximately two-thirds of the team) make the trip to DC.”

He claimed that “for a variety of reasons, several players were not able to adjust schedules to make the trip.”

“On the championship game roster, 26 players had already received their bachelor’s degree, and had no planned obligations on campus beginning that week,” Galbraith said. “Other student-athletes had class obligations as the spring semester began the week prior.”"

Jan. 30 (UPI) -- Halle Berry, Michael B. Jordan and the cast of Empire are among celebrities voicing support for actor Jussie Smollett and outrage over his attack on a Chicago street in an apparent hate crime.

Smollett, 35, who stars as Jamal Lyon on Fox's Empire, is recovering after he was attacked on Tuesday by two unknown men in what was a homophobic and racially-charged incident in Chicago.

The Chicago Police Department said that the television star was walking down a street when he was approached by the men who yelled out racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett was attacked about the face and the men also poured a chemical substance onto him and tied a rope around his neck.

""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,"" 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.

Lee Daniels, the co-creator of Empire, posted his thoughts in a video on Instagram. ""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck,"" he said. ""You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that. It starts at home, it starts at home yo.""

Empire star Gabourey Sidibe uploaded a music video Smollett made that touches on racism, immigration and the 2016 presidential election.

""This despicable act only shamefully reveals how deeply the diseases of hatred, inequality, racism and discrimination continue to course through our country's veins,"" Empire star Lady Grace Byers said alongside a photo of herself with Smollett.

""Your light will continue to shine bright, which is the part these disgusting people fail to realize. I hope you make a speedy recovery and continue to educate, motivate, and inspire millions. Love you big bro,"" Empire star Serayah said next to a photo of herself standing alongside Smollett.

Steve Harvey offered his support in the form of a video. ""As a black man in this country, I'm down with you. I know a lot of brothers that's down with you.

Reports claim the Hollywood actor turned down having extra security around him just days before a brutal attack.

According to reports, Fox Studios increased security last week after receiving a homophobic letter addressed to Smollett.

We’re told Fox made the call to beef up security for everyone on set and wanted to give Jussie additional protection around the clock … but, he declined. Our sources say he made the decision to not have extra security during off-hours because it was an intrusive way of living. Our “Empire” production sources tell us Jussie will have 24/7 armed security going forward … at least until the 2 thugs are apprehended. (TMZ)

According to reports, the horrific attack went down Tuesday in Chicago.

The Empire star, 36, was approached by two people who began “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him,” according to Guglielmi. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.” The attackers fled the scene before Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He has since been released. Guglielmi tells Us that the actor is in “good condition,” and detectives are investigating the incident. (Us Weekly)

The Tuesday morning attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett is now been investigated by the FBI.

A spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department told CNN that the bureau became involved shortly after news reports surfaced. A dozen detectives helped canvas the neighborhood where the incident happened, but they could not find video nor images of the attack.

According to police, Smollett was brutally beaten by men, who also hurled racist and homophobic slurs, in what they’re calling a “possible hate crime” at around 2 a.m. Tuesday morning. The men also put a noose around the actor’s neck. Reportedly, he was grabbing a bite to eat at a local Subway when he was attacked.

Luckily, Smollett was able to get himself to a hospital where he received treatment for his injuries shortly after.

So far the only image associated with the attack was retrieved from security cameras, and was taken from inside the Subway. It only shows Smollett standing by himself.

Chicago police told CNN that Smollett initially did not tell them about the heinous comments hurled at him — such as “This is MAGA country” — when he initially reported the crime. Investigators reached out to him after hearing about them in the media. Smollett then confirmed what his attackers said in an ancillary interview with agents assigned to the case.

A rep for Smollett had no comment, but did tell ESSENCE Wednesday that a donation page has been set up in Smollett’s name at the Black AIDS Institute as the actor is passionate about ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

The vicious attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett has left the Black community stunned

According to Chicago police, the actor was hospitalized after being beaten by men, who were shouting homophobic and racist slurs at him. They also put a noose around his neck.

A number of celebrities have taken to social media to send well wishes to Smollett as he recovers. Reportedly, the actor was able to get himself to the hospital after suffering injuries.

Celebs and friends alike have also expressed their confusion, shock, and anger at the ignorance of the attack. See what they had to say below.

The Manure-Spreaders of Media Sensationalism

Here we go again. If you think the manure-spreaders of sensationalism who masquerade as ethical practitioners of journalism learned anything from last week's MAGA-bashing Covington Catholic High School hoax, I have three words for you:

Ha, ha, ha.

On Tuesday morning, uncorroborated claims by actor Jussie Smollett that he was the victim of a ""brutal"" hate crime by Trump supporters in Chicago went viral across social media. Entertainment rag TMZ.com first splashed ""exclusive"" headlines that the ""Empire"" cast member was ""beaten by MAGA backers"" in a ""homophobic attack"" at around 2 a.m. in Chicago. If you have no idea what ""Empire"" is or who Smollett is, join the club. The TV star is apparently a vocal critic of Trump and attacked ""45 and all his white hooded cohorts"" on Instagram last week.

But I digress.

Within minutes, the gossip site's squib on the TV star's alleged victimization trended on Twitter and rocketed up to USA Today, Variety, CBS, CNN and The New York Times. The Fishwrap of Record breathlessly reported lurid details of two people who ""wrapped rope around his neck,"" which multiple outlets characterized as a ""noose."" A police statement providing incident background stated that ""the offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,"" according to Smollett. Multiple websites reported that the substance was bleach.

This is truly horrible, if true. But color me cautious and skeptical. TMZ initially reported that Smollett had exited a Subway chain restaurant near his luxury apartment when accosted by the racist, homophobic assailants, who allegedly recognized him from his work on ""Empire."" Allegedly, Smollett received a hate mail with the word ""MAGA"" on it addressed to him and sent to his studio in Chicago last week. If this was a premeditated attack, the FBI should get to the bottom of it.

But oddities and discrepancies abound:

TMZ quoted one of the ""MAGA country"" attackers who allegedly hurled epithets at Smollett: ""Aren't you that f----t 'Empire' n-----?""

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces wander around the upscale Streeterville neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about ""MAGA country""?

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces have ever heard of ""Empire,"" could recognize Jussie Smollett, or know or care anything about his sexuality?

Despite TMZ's claim that Smollett had the ""hell beat outta him"" and attackers ""broke his ribs"" plus subjected him to a chemical attack, an ambulance was not called and he instead ""self-transported"" to the hospital. CWB Chicago, a local public safety watchdog site, reported on police dispatch records documenting that Smollett's friend ""Frank"" refused EMS services for Smollett; no mention of bleach was made; ""no or minor injury"" was observed; and ""officers never sent a 'flash; message with offender descriptions to field units.""

Weird.

Another assertion not included in the CPD's initial press release on the incident: Any mention of ""MAGA supporters"" or any mention of the race of the alleged assailants. Police clarified that they had not received any official information backing TMZ reporter Charles Latibeaudiere's claim, which he attributed to sources close to Smollett, that the alleged attackers shouted, ""This is MAGA country.""

Nor had the police corroborated that the attackers were white, since Smollett had told them their faces and hands were both covered. After launching a search for surveillance video and potential witnesses, the police department reported late Tuesday that ""thus far we have not found anything to be able to put out a description.""

I was told that public records requests for the incident report may take ""weeks"" to be approved. I was also told the Chicago police remain in charge of investigating the alleged incident, while the FBI probe of the alleged hate mail remains separate

CPD's public information office also told me late Tuesday that when police responded to the 911 call regarding the incident, Smollett gave them no details about where it occurred or what the attackers looked like. None. They were reportedly on scene for an hour with Smollett. When I asked again how the claims about white ""MAGA attackers"" were disseminated in the press, the PIO replied:

""We have no idea where that came from.""

Minutes after I hung up the phone with her, a local Chicago reporter tweeted that Smollett did mention the ""MAGA"" angle in a ""follow-up, supplemental interview."" Which is it?

Despite all the holes, contradictions and unanswered questions, the MAGA hate crime narrative has already calcified. (Sound familiar?) By 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, a search for ""MAGA"" and ""Smollett"" on Google yielded 3,520,000 results. And TMZ ended its day of social justice pot-stirring with the Rev. Al Sharpton calling for President Donald Trump to ""denounce Jussie Smollett's MAGA attackers"" who have yet to be identified.

Classic manufactured ""news:"" Report on an uncorroborated hate crime. Plant unverified details. Repeatedly blame white male Trump supporters. Stoke Hollywood outrage. Enlist the godfather of hate crime hoaxes to call on the president to denounce phantom attackers. Reap clicks and publicity. Indict all skeptics as racists and haters. Repeat.

Smears first. Facts later. How much deader can American journalism get?"

Actor/singer Jussie Smollett, best known for his portrayal of musician Jamal Lyon on the Fox series “Empire,” has been the victim of an apparent hate crime in Chicago—and the suspects, TMZ is reporting, told him, “This is MAGA country.”

The 36-year-old actor, who is African-American and openly gay, had arrived in Chicago from New York City late Monday night and went to a Subway to get something to eat. After leaving that Subway, according to TMZ, Smollett was attacked by two white men who wore ski masks and used racial and anti-gay slurs.

The assailants, TMZ reports, beat Smollett, poured bleach on him, put a rope around his neck and declared, “This is MAGA country” as they were leaving. MAGA is short for “Make America Great Again,” which was President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan.

Although Smollett suffered a broken rib, he was well enough to be discharged from Chicago’s Northwestern Hospital on Tuesday morning, January 29.

Smollett had been the subject of racial threats before the incident, which Chicago police are investigating. ThatGrapeJuice.Net has posted a note that was sent to Fox’s Chicago studio and told Smollett, “You will die, black f****r”; according to TMZ’s sources, the letter was sent more than a week ago.

Smollett was cast as Jamal Lyon, a gay R&B singer, in 2014—and he came out as gay during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres in March 2015. The Northern California native is known for his recording career as well as his acting, and Smollett’s album, Sum of My Music, was released in 2018.

THE BUZZ

After winning the war against ex-Gov. Bruce Rauner and entering into what should be the golden days of his career, House Speaker Mike Madigan saw his name dragged into the corruption case against Ald. Ed. Burke.

Advertisement

According to Tuesday’s Sun-Times bombshell report, the FBI secretly recorded Madigan talking about his private law firm during a meeting with Ald. Danny Solis and a hotel developer looking to build in Chinatown. Madigan is not charged with any wrongdoing. And in a statement, he said, “To my knowledge, I am not under investigation by the office of the U.S. attorney, and I have not been contacted by the U.S. attorney relative to Dan Solis.”

State lawmakers I talked to were taking a wait-and-see approach to the story — it‘s an eyebrow-raising revelation but it’s still doesn’t mean anything without a charge. “He’s a lawyer trying to get business for his private law firm. That’s what lawyers do,” said one state representative, echoing what many Springfield legislators had to say. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he had no opinion on the news (Sun-Times story here ). More than a few lawmakers acknowledged having mentally retraced their own conversations with Madigan—just as many did when the Sun-Times revealed Solis turned mole. “It’s a reminder that you just presume everyone wears a wire,” said another lawmaker.

You don’t have to tell that to Madigan. In all his years, he’s never been charged with wrongdoing (the same can’t be said for Burke, for example). Madigan is careful about drawing the line—maybe right to the edge—between political work and private practice. Madigan’s also cautious about how he communicates. He doesn’t use a cell phone unless he borrows someone else’s.

Madigan was a no-show at the speaker’s podium Tuesday for Day One of the General Assembly. Spokesman Steve Brown told POLITICO the speaker was working in his office, meeting with lawmakers and getting committee assignments nailed down. It was a day that should have been heralded as a new beginning in state government. That was the case across the hall in the state Senate, where Pritzker showed up to celebrate the new session.

On the House side, there was neither fanfare nor a gubernatorial visit. Majority Leader Greg Harris led lawmakers in a debate about the Rules. Then came an announcement that the House would adjourn until next week due to cold weather. The Senate, meanwhile, is in session today.

MORE BUZZ

Lawmakers yesterday took part in sexual harassment training that was described as intense. It prompted chatter all day long about what’s appropriate in the comfy confines of the Capitol. It’s not OK, for example, to greet colleagues with a hug or kiss without their permission. The no-touching rule touched off a debate among lawmakers who see their colleagues as friends. For some, a hug and peck on the cheek are how you say hello. A woman legislator, though, said it really shouldn’t be so difficult to say “Do you mind if I hug you?” The discussion was moderated by an investigator for the Illinois Department of Human Rights, according to one attendee.

Fresham Democratic Rep. Anne Stava-Murray, who has been a lightning rod on the issue, attended the training and took part in discussions. “It was worth it to be the voice in the room that said the things that needed to be said,” she told POLITICO. Stava-Murray previously said she was “forcibly kissed” by a lawmaker at a gathering for freshman legislators. Tuesday’s sexual harassment training was instituted after the #MeToo movement hit the statehouse. Among some incidents: Tim Mapes, former chief of staff to Mike Madigan, was fired after a state employee accused him of sexual harassment.

Here we go again. If you think the manure-spreaders of sensationalism who masquerade as ethical practitioners of journalism learned anything from last week’s MAGA-bashing Covington Catholic High School hoax, I have three words for you:

Ha, ha, ha.

On Tuesday morning, uncorroborated claims by actor Jussie Smollett that he was the victim of a “brutal” hate crime by Trump supporters in Chicago went viral across social media. Entertainment rag TMZ.com first splashed “exclusive” headlines that the “Empire” cast member was “beaten by MAGA backers” in a “homophobic attack” at around 2 a.m. in Chicago. If you have no idea what “Empire” is or who Smollett is, join the club. The TV star is apparently a vocal critic of Trump and attacked “45 and all his white hooded cohorts” on Instagram last week.

But I digress.

Within minutes, the gossip site’s squib on the TV star’s alleged victimization trended on Twitter and rocketed up to USA Today, Variety, CBS, CNN and The New York Times. The Fishwrap of Record breathlessly reported lurid details of two people who “wrapped rope around his neck,” which multiple outlets characterized as a “noose.” A police statement providing incident background stated that “the offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” according to Smollett. Multiple websites reported that the substance was bleach.

This is truly horrible, if true. But color me cautious and skeptical. TMZ initially reported that Smollett had exited a Subway chain restaurant near his luxury apartment when accosted by the racist, homophobic assailants, who allegedly recognized him from his work on “Empire.” Allegedly, Smollett received a hate mail with the word “MAGA” on it addressed to him and sent to his studio in Chicago last week. If this was a premeditated attack, the FBI should get to the bottom of it.

But oddities and discrepancies abound:

TMZ quoted one of the “MAGA country” attackers who allegedly hurled epithets at Smollett: “Aren’t you that f—-t ‘Empire’ n—–?”

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces wander around the upscale Streeterville neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about “MAGA country”?

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces have ever heard of “Empire,” could recognize Jussie Smollett, or know or care anything about his sexuality?

Despite TMZ’s claim that Smollett had the “hell beat outta him” and attackers “broke his ribs” plus subjected him to a chemical attack, an ambulance was not called and he instead “self-transported” to the hospital. CWB Chicago, a local public safety watchdog site, reported on police dispatch records documenting that Smollett’s friend “Frank” refused EMS services for Smollett; no mention of bleach was made; “no or minor injury” was observed; and “officers never sent a ‘flash; message with offender descriptions to field units.”

Weird.

Another assertion not included in the CPD’s initial press release on the incident: Any mention of “MAGA supporters” or any mention of the race of the alleged assailants. Police clarified that they had not received any official information backing TMZ reporter Charles Latibeaudiere’s claim, which he attributed to sources close to Smollett, that the alleged attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country.”

Nor had the police corroborated that the attackers were white, since Smollett had told them their faces and hands were both covered. After launching a search for surveillance video and potential witnesses, the police department reported late Tuesday that “thus far we have not found anything to be able to put out a description.”

I was told that public records requests for the incident report may take “weeks” to be approved. I was also told the Chicago police remain in charge of investigating the alleged incident, while the FBI probe of the alleged hate mail remains separate

CPD’s public information office also told me late Tuesday that when police responded to the 911 call regarding the incident, Smollett gave them no details about where it occurred or what the attackers looked like. None. They were reportedly on scene for an hour with Smollett. When I asked again how the claims about white “MAGA attackers” were disseminated in the press, the PIO replied:

“We have no idea where that came from.”

Minutes after I hung up the phone with her, a local Chicago reporter tweeted that Smollett did mention the “MAGA” angle in a “follow-up, supplemental interview.” Which is it?

Despite all the holes, contradictions and unanswered questions, the MAGA hate crime narrative has already calcified. (Sound familiar?) By 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, a search for “MAGA” and “Smollett” on Google yielded 3,520,000 results. And TMZ ended its day of social justice pot-stirring with the Rev. Al Sharpton calling for President Donald Trump to “denounce Jussie Smollett’s MAGA attackers” who have yet to be identified.

Classic manufactured “news:” Report on an uncorroborated hate crime. Plant unverified details. Repeatedly blame white male Trump supporters. Stoke Hollywood outrage. Enlist the godfather of hate crime hoaxes to call on the president to denounce phantom attackers. Reap clicks and publicity. Indict all skeptics as racists and haters. Repeat.

Janet Jackson has reportedly landed a headlining slot at this year's Glastonbury Festival.



According to Britain's The Sun newspaper, Janet will be taking to the stage at Worthy Farm in Somerset, England as part of the country's iconic music festival.



If the reports are true, it would be the 52-year-old singer's first-ever Glastonbury performance.



""Janet is relaunching her career in a major way this year and she thought this would be the perfect opportunity,"" a source told the publication. ""She has never performed at Glastonbury but she knows what a massive deal it is.



""It is looking like she will perform on Sunday but her exact slot is to be confirmed. Organisers are still booking acts and arranging the schedule but she is really excited to be back.""



Janet has yet to comment on the rumours on her social media pages. She did, however, send her love to Empire star Jussie Smollett on Tuesday (29Jan19), sharing a picture of the pair together after news broke that he'd been attacked in a suspected hate crime in Chicago.



""Sending u my love,"" Janet wrote, alongside purple heart and praying hands emojis.



Other stars confirmed to be playing the 2019 Glastonbury Festival include Janelle Monae, Stormzy and Kylie Minogue.



""I'm so thrilled to announce that I'll be playing the 'Legend slot' on Sunday 30th June at @GlastoFest 2019,"" Kylie wrote on Twitter last year (18). ""It will be 14 years since I was originally meant to appear there and so much has happened up to now. I can't wait to see you all there to share this special show.""



The 50-year-old had been scheduled to headline the iconic festival in 2005 but was forced to pull out a month beforehand as she battled breast cancer, and was subsequently replaced by Basement Jaxx. The Australian star was declared cancer-free in early 2006.



The 2019 Glastonbury Festival runs from 26 to 30 June.

The mood was somber on the set of Empire in Chicago on Tuesday: Deadline reports: ‘Counselors and a SAG-AFTRA representative were made available on the set of the Terrence Howard-Taraji P. Henson series Tuesday to talk with and listen to cast, crew and producers. The intention is that those trauma counselors will continue to maintain a presence on the Windy City-filmed Empire over the coming few weeks as Smollett returns to the show and the law enforcement investigation into the two men who attacked the actor unfolds. Key principals on the show were informed early Tuesday of the racist and homophobic slurs, beating and chemical substance-drenching Smollett endured despite attempting to defend himself. However, the overall Empire set was told collectively by a producer of what had happened to the actor who plays Jamal Lyon on the show.’"

The Empire star was allegedly attacked by two men wearing ski masks in the early hours of Jan. 29 in Chicago. TMZ first reported that Smollett had identified the two attackers as white, and that he had told police that they had yelled, “This is MAGA country!”.

However, the Chicago Police Department has disputed that he told them that, at least initially, or identified the race of the attackers, who allegedly used racist and homophobic language and placed a rope around Smollett’s neck. The Daily Beast reported that Chicago police said the race and gender of the alleged assailants remained unknown.

Additionally, in their initial report, Jussie Smollett did not tell police his attackers yelled “MAGA.” Chicago Police PIO added: “I’m not saying it’s not true.

Now, police say there is surveillance video placing Smollett near the scene of the alleged crime, but there is no video of the attackers.

“You didn’t deserve this. Nobody deserves to have a noose put around their neck,” Lee Daniels, creator of the TV show Empire , said in an Instagram post.

The photo along with the post appears to show Smollet with a cut under his eye.

According to ABC News, federal authorities will assist the Chicago Police Department into the case, which is currently being investigated as a “possible” hate crime.

The 35-year-old actor transported himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital Tuesday (Jan. 29) morning, after being beaten by two white men in ski-masks who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him,

Smollett attempted to fight back but the attackers doused him with bleach and wrapped a noose around his neck, before fleeing the scene.

Smollett was leaving a Subway restaurant when the men began yelling to get his attention. He told police that the men also yelled, “This is MAGA country,” during the attack.

Though Smollett did not suffer life-threatening injuries, he was left shaken by the assault. The vicious incident comes about a week after he received a letter threatening his life.

TMZ has an extensive timeline of how everything went down.

The Empire cast was informed about the horrific assault on Jussie Smollett during a meeting Tuesday morning. The cast will now receive armed security as an added precaution.

Numerous celebrities rushed to social media to offer their support.

Jussie Smollett, one of the stars of the TV show Empire, reportedly was brutally attacked early Tuesday in what Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime. The 36-year-old actor took himself to the hospital directly after what police called a “possible racially-charged assault and battery”; authorities say he is in good condition.

Police received a report that Smollett, who is black and gay, was walking in the downtown Chicago neighborhood of Streeterville around 2 a.m. local time “when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the city’s police department told NPR. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.”

The alleged assault did not end there.

“At some point during the incident,” police added, “one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

Authorities say the two attackers fled on foot. Chicago police say they are gathering video, identifying potential witnesses and trying to establish a timeline of events.

Police put out a call for anyone who had been in the area at the time to submit information to their tip line.

Smollett’s mother is African-American and his father is Jewish. In a 2016 interview, he calls his family “blu-ish — black and Jewish.”

On Fox’s Empire, Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, a young gay man trying to win his music mogul father’s approval.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to NPR that it was “deeply saddened and outraged” at the news. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

In an emotional video, Empire co-creator Lee Daniels addressed Smollett, whom he calls “my son.”

“You didn’t deserve, nor anyone deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” he says. “You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. … Hold your head up, Jussie. I’m with you, I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another f****** day in America.”

Co-creator Danny Strong called Smollett “a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart.”

In a statement to NPR, GLAAD Communications Director Mathew Lasky said Smollett is “a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”"

The FBI is also involved in the case, but so far investigators have been unable to put out a description of the suspects, reports CBS News' Dean Reynolds.

Smollett, who plays a gay musician on the hit Fox show ""Empire,"" and identifies as gay in real life, said he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racist epithets, gay slurs, and put a noose around his neck. A police dispatcher had the barest of details on the early morning attack, which was reported by Smollett's business manager.



""Regarding a friend who was assaulted and battered … he's supposed to be well-known … a noose was placed around the friend's neck,"" the dispatcher said.



When police got to his apartment, they said a noose was still around Smollett's neck. He told them he was also doused with an unknown chemical and officers said they smelled bleach on his clothes.

In a now-deleted Instagram post by ""Empire"" co-creator Lee Daniels, Smollett appeared to have an abrasion on his cheek. Daniels said, ""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you.""

Police said in a subsequent meeting, Smollett added his assailants referenced President Trump's campaign slogan – ""make America great again"" – during the attack.

Twelve detectives and a number of FBI agents are now investigating what has been classified as a possible hate crime. But sources said they have seen security video of Smollett outdoors early Tuesday morning and nothing of an assault. Detectives have expanded the search area for video of the alleged assailants but haven't found any footage or witnesses.



Smollett's ""Empire"" co-star Vivica A. Fox tweeted, ""I'm so angry and hurt about this!"" California Senator Kamala Harris, a 2020 presidential candidate, called the attack ""an attempted modern day lynching.""

In a statement, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said it was ""deeply saddened and outraged"" by the ""despicable act of violence and hate."" After the attack, Smollett went to the hospital, where he was evaluated and released."

One of Jussie’s close friend said the actor arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday, and at around 2 AM he was hungry and went to a Subway with plans to get food.

It was on his way that he was attacked by two whites who had allegedly called Jussie a faggot before they pounced on him.

He fought back, but they allegedly beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left, they yelled, ‘This is MAGA country.’

Jussie was taken to Northwestern Memorial where he was treated. He was discharged later Tuesday morning.

Authorities in Chicago said they are investigating the attack as a possible hate crime, and they are searching the area for any video as more evidence.

It can be recalled that this isn’t the first time Jussie is being targeted by homophobes.

Few days ago, a letter was sent to Fox Studios in Chicago with cut out letters spelling, “You will die black fag.” The letter was said to be meant for Jussie.

The envelope that was used to deliver the letter was inscribed ‘MAGA’ in the upper left corner."

According to The Root the rapper filed a couple of lawsuits earlier this week and one of them is against Hova's record company.

""Kanye West has filed a pair of lawsuits in what may be an attempt to extradite himself from contracts and reclaim control over his career. One lawsuit is against EMI, the song publisher that has administered the rights to his songs since 2003, shortly before the hip-hop star released his debut album, The College Dropout. The other is against Roc-a-Fella Records, UMG Recordings, Def Jam and Bravado International Group.""

In the lawsuit Kanye also apparently claimed he was responsible for ""revitalizing"" Jay-Z's career with his writing and production contributions.

According to Chicago police, Smollett was stopped around 2 a.m. on Tuesday by two men wearing ski masks who began yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

It was learned the attackers of the Empire star placed a noose around his neck after which they began to punch him and then pour an unknown substance on him.

“This is MAGA country,” the men then yelled, according to a report by TMZ.

Reacting to the attack in a post on social media network, Instagram, Bobrisky described it as “inhumane” noting that he not surprised that “Jamal” was attacked because “the hearts of men are desperately wicked”.

News of the early morning attack left the entertainment world reeling and gay advocacy groups speaking out in support of the 36-year-old actor.

Smollett was beaten at around 2:00 am by two attackers who yelled “racial and homophobic slurs” while he walked downtown in the third-biggest US city, said police, who did not name him but said the victim was an actor from “Empire.”

Smollett’s fellow cast members and production company identified him as the victim.

The attackers poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him, and then wrapped a rope around the actor’s neck, according to police.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” the Chicago Police Department said.

The actor and singer was reportedly in Chicago for a scheduled Saturday concert.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, who on the weekend launched her 2020 campaign to be America’s first black female president, called the incident “an attempted modern day lynching.”

“No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate,” Harris said on Twitter.

Members of the “Empire” production team and cast, as well as the studio that produces the program, also spoke out.

“The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own,” 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.

The show’s co-creator Lee Daniels posted an Instagram video calling Jussie “my son.”

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” Daniels said, addressing the actor.

“Hold your head up Jussie. I’m with you. I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another fucking day in America,” he said.

Advocacy groups including The Trevor Project and the American Civil Liberties Union, quickly offered their support as well.

“LGBTQ people of color live at multiple intersections of oppression, too often facing violence compounded by both racism and homophobia,” the ACLU said.

“This isn’t the America we want to live in.”"

Smollett was the victim of an apparent homophobic and racist attack in Chicago on Tuesday morning, according to the Chicago Police Department. Smollett was reportedly walking down the street when two men started yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, before repeatedly hitting him and allegedly putting a noose around his neck.

In spite of the horrifying nature of the incident, the actor and musician is still scheduled to perform live at the famed West Hollywood venue the Troubadour on Saturday, ET Canada has confirmed with Smollett’s publicist.

Paul Kacik of the concert booking company Sean Healy Presents told The Los Angeles Times that they are “going on with the show as far as we know, until we hear anything different.”

Meanwhile, production on Smollett’s Fox drama “Empire” has been temporarily shut down, but the halt is not related to the attack. Instead, the show is one of multiple programs filmed in Chicago — including “Proven Innocent” — that have stopped production due to extreme weather conditions.

ET has learned that FOX provided counselors to the cast and crew of “Empire” to talk about the incident with Smollett and to answer any questions.

Additionally, ET learned that Smollett and the rest of the cast will have armed security going forward as Fox has stepped up security for members of production after a threatening letter was received.

A source told ET that, during the attack, the actor “tried to protect himself and at one point the men poured a substance on him believed to be bleach and one of the guys put a rope around his neck.”

“After some time the men fled the scene and Jussie went to the hospital,” the source said. “Jussie is mostly physically OK with some scrapes and bruises, but he’s more emotionally shook up.”

According to police, Smollett was self-transported to Northwestern Hospital following the attack and is in good condition. Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told ET in a statement that an investigation is currently underway, and they are “treating it as a possible hate crime.”

“Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire,” the statement reads. “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com.”

On Tuesday evening, Guglielmi announced on Twitter that police have “expanded the search area for cameras to be able to provide photos of the alleged assailants in this attack.”

Guglielmi added that, thus far, “No video of the alleged assailants or a vehicle has been discovered but we are continuing to broaden our search.”

Police said they interviewed a person of interest and he later confessed to his involvement in the murders of the 2 victims.

Marcus Fisher, 18, was arrested and charged with 2 counts of murder and 1 count of 2nd-degree arson.

A Montville man is accused of killing his grandparents and trying to burn down their house and court documents say he admitted to police that he'd stabbed both of them.

State police have arrested 18-year-old Marcus Fisher and charged him with two counts of murder, one count of murder with special circumstances and one count of criminal attempt to commit arson in the second degree.

According to court documents, Fisher initially denied hurting his grandparents but later admitted that he’d gotten into an argument with his grandfather after dinner on Sunday night and stabbed him in the chest with a kitchen knife.

When his grandmother came in, he stabbed her too, he told police.

Officers began investigating when Fisher called 911 around 4:45 a.m. Monday and reported two bodies in the house.

He told investigators that his grandparents had been stabbed a few hours earlier and he’d been there for “the event,” court documents say.

When law enforcement authorities arrived at the Morgan Street home, they found Fisher outside with cuts and a ""blood-like substance"" on his hands.

He told them that he’d lit a bonfire and had been outside for a few hours, the investigation report says.

As police investigated, they asked Fisher if he’d hurt his grandparents and he initially told them that he didn’t, but then admitted that he did, according to court paperwork.

Police detained Fisher and brought him to state police barracks, where he waived his rights.

He then told investigators that he’d stabbed his grandfather after an argument and then stabbed his grandmother, according to court documents.

After the stabbing, Fisher cleaned the knife, went outside, lit a fire and tried to burn the house down, according to police.

He’d also left the gas on at the house, according to police.

State police alerted law enforcement who were still at the house and they turned off the gas stove.

Outside the house, police also found several burnt and smoldering branches and logs on a propane tank, according to the investigation report.

Authorities have identified the victims as 77-year-old Gertrude Piscezeck and 76-year-old John Piscezeck.

Bond for Fisher was set at $1 million. He is due in court on February 4.

On 29 January, it was reported that Empire star Jussie Smollett had been admitted to hospital following a suspected racist and homophobic attack.

There’s a large discrepancy between the number of people who’ve witnessed acts of racism and those who decide to act upon it.

According to research conducted by business psychology firm Pearn Kandola with 1,500 individuals between November 2017 and January 2018, more than half of people in the UK have witnessed an act of racism in the workplace.

However, almost one third of those people did nothing about it.

Here’s what you can do if you see someone being racially abused in public:

Speak up if it’s safe to do so

As per the Public Order Act of 1986, it’s a criminal offence for someone to deliberately stir up racial hatred by directing insulting language at an individual or exhibiting threatening behaviour.

If you witness someone being racially abused, you could stand up to the perpetrator by asking them to leave the victim alone.

However, as the Australian Human Rights Commission outlines as part of its “Racism. It stops with me” campaign, you should only say something if you think that it’s safe to do so in that particular situation.

“Standing up to racism can be a powerful sign of support. It can also make the perpetrator think twice about their actions,” the organisation states.

“When responding, always assess the situation and never put yourself at risk. Your actions don’t need to involve confrontation.”

The use of racist language can have a very harmful impact on the mental health of victims, as charity Campaign Against Living Miserably explains.

“People who say stuff that’s racist may not consider themselves as being prejudiced, but may take the mick out of someone’s accent or birthplace,” the charity writes.

“Although it is easy to go along with a joke at someone else’s expense, it makes people feel down, depressed, worthless and isolated.”

Report the incident

If you witness an incident of racial abuse, then it would be wise to report the incident to the authorities.

Not only will this ensure that the perpetrator is appropriately dealt with, but it will also provide the victim with security.

Childline advises making a note of every detail of the incident as soon as possible, as your witness account could prove vital as evidence later on.

If you believe that the victim is being threatened by the perpetrator or is at risk of further attack, then you can report the incident to the police by calling 999 or 101.

Despite the prevalence of racism in the workplace, the study conducted by Pearn Kandola highlighted the need for more people to report it.

“I’m astounded that the rates of witnessed racism in the modern workplace are still so staggeringly high,” says Professor Binna Kandola OBE, senior partner at Pearn Kandola.

More than a third of those polled by the company who reported racial abuse were white, in comparison to a quarter of black people and a quarter of Asian people.

“It’s encouraging that white people, who are the least likely to experience racism, as the most likely to fight the issue,” Professor Kandola says.

“The fact that ethnic minority people are the least likely to take action against racism, out of fear of the consequences, suggests that organisations provide less psychological safety for minority groups.”

How to support victims of racial abuse at work

In the opinion of Sandra Kerr OBE, race equality director of non-profit organisation Business in the Community (BITC), employers should be doing far more to make employees feel as though they can safely report incidents of racial abuse at work.

“Many incidents of racial harassment occur in workplaces - whether that’s directed towards employees or between customers or clients - yet often employees feel unable to call this behaviour out,” she tells The Independent.

According to recent research carried out by BITC, only 22 per cent of employees said that they feel as though they’ve received adequate support from their employees when addressing harassment.

“Employers can take a number of approaches in supporting employees to call out racial bullying and harassment,” she explains.

“These could include providing employees with training on how to respond to these incidents and when to escalate them to a supervisor, and an approved script on how to defuse the situation which is tailored to the organisation.”

Kerr also stresses that employees should be made to feel comfortable reporting racial harassment internally within an organisation.

“Formal and informal reporting mechanisms should be made available, so employees have multiple ways to report, and employers should clearly communicate their zero tolerance policies and that they take this issue seriously,” she says."

Janet Jackson has reportedly landed a headlining slot at this year's Glastonbury Festival.



According to Britain's The Sun newspaper, Janet will be taking to the stage at Worthy Farm in Somerset, England as part of the country's iconic music festival.



If the reports are true, it would be the 52-year-old singer's first-ever Glastonbury performance.



""Janet is relaunching her career in a major way this year and she thought this would be the perfect opportunity,"" a source told the publication. ""She has never performed at Glastonbury but she knows what a massive deal it is.



""It is looking like she will perform on Sunday but her exact slot is to be confirmed. Organisers are still booking acts and arranging the schedule but she is really excited to be back.""



Janet has yet to comment on the rumours on her social media pages. She did, however, send her love to Empire star Jussie Smollett on Tuesday (29Jan19), sharing a picture of the pair together after news broke that he'd been attacked in a suspected hate crime in Chicago.



""Sending u my love,"" Janet wrote, alongside purple heart and praying hands emojis.



Other stars confirmed to be playing the 2019 Glastonbury Festival include Janelle Monae, Stormzy and Kylie Minogue.



""I'm so thrilled to announce that I'll be playing the 'Legend slot' on Sunday 30th June at @GlastoFest 2019,"" Kylie wrote on Twitter last year (18). ""It will be 14 years since I was originally meant to appear there and so much has happened up to now. I can't wait to see you all there to share this special show.""



The 50-year-old had been scheduled to headline the iconic festival in 2005 but was forced to pull out a month beforehand as she battled breast cancer, and was subsequently replaced by Basement Jaxx. The Australian star was declared cancer-free in early 2006.



The 2019 Glastonbury Festival runs from 26 to 30 June.

A show-stopping Learjet limo has been unveiled, featuring a fully-custom design that has transformed a former plane into a nightclub on wheels.

The one-of-a-kind vehicle, which cost more than $1 million (£760,000) to construct and can transport up to eight passengers, uses four 28-inch wheels attached to a wingless Learjet fuselage.

It is now available to anybody prepared to pay $5 million for the contraption.

Before it was debuted in 2018, the 28-metre (42ft)-long Limo-Jet was in the making for 12 years.

Impressive: The incredible hybrid craft - part car, part plane - is pictured inside a hanger located at Lakeville, Minnesota, USA

On thew runway: Although it looks like it could take off, the former jet plane is obviously grounded without its wings

Step inside: The hatch opens and reveals a row of neon-lit seats which can host up to eight passengers

Branded: The Limo-Jet has been a labour of love for the two men involved and is testament to their engineering skills

It was developed by the Illinois-based Jetsetter, Inc and the idea was conceived back in 2006 by Dan Harris and Frank DeAngelo and is based in Lakeville, Minnesota, USA.

The inside is packed to with lights, speakers, screens, and enough seating for a wedding party.

It is no longer powered by the original jet engine but a V8 internal combustion engine.

The old engine housings have been fitted with lights to provide a soft glow at night.

Exact dimensions of the so-called Learjet remain unknown but the mystery and intrigue is part of the appeal according to Mr DeAngelo.

'We've had people pull over on the side of the road, get out of the car and video tape the limo,' he said.

Work in progress! The former jet is seen in the middle of its dramatic transformation, complete with shrink-wrapped wheels

How to make an entrance: There's plenty of room inside for guests to recline without it feeling cramped

For your viewing pleasure: A TV is mounted on the interior of Frank DeAngelo's one-of-a-kind Limo Jet

Have wheels, will travel - in style! The Limo Jet, a 42ft-long GM Vortec V8-powered limo, proudly sits on the tarmac

All about that bass: Speakers are mounted on the rear bumper of the Limo Jet, a 42ft long limo built using a Lear Jet fuselage

Aesthetically pleasing: A luxurious red finish can be seen on the rims of the vehicle's alloy wheels

Driving seat: Monitors are mounted in the dashboard, which allows the designated driver to view throughout the interior

What's in a name? A Limo Jet logo can be seen on the side of Frank DeAngelo's 42ft long acquisition

Rear of the year: Neon lights illuminate the back of the 'club on wheels', which has literally stopped traffic

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? The unique engineering vision commands attention as it inhabits its hanger

The length and breadth of it all: Impressively, the Learjet measures a whopping 42ft-long

Men with a mission: Business partner Dima Kashevatsky (left) and owner of the Limo Jet, Frank DeAngelo (right)

Getting prepped with an undercoat: The old plane is given a base coat, before being daubed in metallic red

If you think the manure-spreaders of sensationalism who masquerade as ethical practitioners of journalism learned anything from last week's MAGA-bashing Covington Catholic High School hoax, I have three words for you:

Ha, ha, ha.

On Tuesday morning, uncorroborated claims by actor Jussie Smollett that he was the victim of a ""brutal"" hate crime by Trump supporters in Chicago went viral across social media. Entertainment rag TMZ.com first splashed ""exclusive"" headlines that the ""Empire"" cast member was ""beaten by MAGA backers"" in a ""homophobic attack"" at around 2 a.m. in Chicago. If you have no idea what ""Empire"" is or who Smollett is, join the club. The TV star is apparently a vocal critic of Trump and attacked ""45 and all his white hooded cohorts"" on Instagram last week.

But I digress.

Within minutes, the gossip site's squib on the TV star's alleged victimization trended on Twitter and rocketed up to USA Today, Variety, CBS, CNN and The New York Times. The Fishwrap of Record breathlessly reported lurid details of two people who ""wrapped rope around his neck,"" which multiple outlets characterized as a ""noose."" A police statement providing incident background stated that ""the offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,"" according to Smollett. Multiple websites reported that the substance was bleach.

This is truly horrible, if true. But color me cautious and skeptical. TMZ initially reported that Smollett had exited a Subway chain restaurant near his luxury apartment when accosted by the racist, homophobic assailants, who allegedly recognized him from his work on ""Empire."" Allegedly, Smollett received a hate mail with the word ""MAGA"" on it addressed to him and sent to his studio in Chicago last week. If this was a premeditated attack, the FBI should get to the bottom of it.

But oddities and discrepancies abound:

TMZ quoted one of the ""MAGA country"" attackers who allegedly hurled epithets at Smollett: ""Aren't you that f----t 'Empire' n-----?""

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces wander around the upscale Streeterville neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about ""MAGA country""?

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces have ever heard of ""Empire,"" could recognize Jussie Smollett, or know or care anything about his sexuality?

Despite TMZ's claim that Smollett had the ""hell beat outta him"" and attackers ""broke his ribs"" plus subjected him to a chemical attack, an ambulance was not called and he instead ""self-transported"" to the hospital. CWB Chicago, a local public safety watchdog site, reported on police dispatch records documenting that Smollett's friend ""Frank"" refused EMS services for Smollett; no mention of bleach was made; ""no or minor injury"" was observed; and ""officers never sent a 'flash; message with offender descriptions to field units.""

Weird.

Another assertion not included in the CPD's initial press release on the incident: Any mention of ""MAGA supporters"" or any mention of the race of the alleged assailants. Police clarified that they had not received any official information backing TMZ reporter Charles Latibeaudiere's claim, which he attributed to sources close to Smollett, that the alleged attackers shouted, ""This is MAGA country.""

Nor had the police corroborated that the attackers were white, since Smollett had told them their faces and hands were both covered. After launching a search for surveillance video and potential witnesses, the police department reported late Tuesday that ""thus far we have not found anything to be able to put out a description.""

I was told that public records requests for the incident report may take ""weeks"" to be approved. I was also told the Chicago police remain in charge of investigating the alleged incident, while the FBI probe of the alleged hate mail remains separate

CPD's public information office also told me late Tuesday that when police responded to the 911 call regarding the incident, Smollett gave them no details about where it occurred or what the attackers looked like. None.

They were reportedly on scene for an hour with Smollett. When I asked again how the claims about white ""MAGA attackers"" were disseminated in the press, the PIO replied:

""We have no idea where that came from.""

Minutes after I hung up the phone with her, a local Chicago reporter tweeted that Smollett did mention the ""MAGA"" angle in a ""follow-up, supplemental interview."" Which is it?

Despite all the holes, contradictions and unanswered questions, the MAGA hate crime narrative has already calcified. (Sound familiar?) By 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, a search for ""MAGA"" and ""Smollett"" on Google yielded 3,520,000 results. And TMZ ended its day of social justice pot-stirring with the Rev. Al Sharpton calling for President Donald Trump to ""denounce Jussie Smollett's MAGA attackers"" who have yet to be identified.

Classic manufactured ""news:"" Report on an uncorroborated hate crime. Plant unverified details. Repeatedly blame white male Trump supporters. Stoke Hollywood outrage. Enlist the godfather of hate crime hoaxes to call on the president to denounce phantom attackers. Reap clicks and publicity. Indict all skeptics as racists and haters. Repeat.

Smears first. Facts later. How much deader can American journalism get?

Police did not release the actor’s name but a statement from Fox, which airs “Empire,” identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime. Smollett is black and openly gay.

According to a police statement, the actor was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an “unknown substance” on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that when officers first came in contact with Smollett, he still had a rope around his neck. While being interviewed by detectives, Guglielmi said Smollett told them that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The police spokesman added that the two men were wearing masks. Investigators have not found any surveillance video or witnesses from which they can put together a description of the offenders, he said.

Smollett was able to take himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was last reported in good condition.

Guglielmi also said the FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago last week.

The hourlong drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Jamal Lyon, Smollett’s character, is the gay, middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Tuesday in support of Smollett. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence,” the statement read.

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels also voiced his support for Smollett in an Instagram video.

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” Daniels said. “You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.”

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

“He is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I’ve ever met,” Harris said Tuesday, adding that she’s still learning more details about the incident.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues and he released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

“Empire” is shot in Chicago and a Fox spokeswoman said the program is currently in production.

(You can also get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)

1. Cold wave

Record lows. Canceled flights. No mail delivery. Almost-instant frostbite. That’s what people in the Midwest are dealing with today as the region grapples with what meteorologists call the “coldest air in a generation.” Most of the Midwest will be well below zero for the next few days. And about a quarter of the US population will suffer through subzero temps between now and Monday.

Chicago could see a record low of 27 below zero by tomorrow morning. And in Minnesota, strong winds could push the low to 70 below zero, conditions that could lead to frostbite on exposed skin in as few as five minutes. Extreme weather has killed at least three people, and authorities urge people to stay indoors, bundle up and check on the elderly and the homeless. If you’re sipping warm coffee now, you can check out what this kind of cold actually looks like.

2. Intelligence chiefs

The gulf between President Trump and the country’s top intelligence chiefs was on full display during a Senate hearing. The heads of the intel agencies, including Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel, contradicted many foreign policy claims made by the President.

• On ISIS. Trump says the terror group has been defeated; the intel chiefs say it’s resurgent.

• On North Korea. Trump says the nuclear threat is over; the intel chiefs say it’s unlikely the North will completely give up its nukes.

• On Iran. Trump says pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal was the best way to stop Iran from developing a nuke; the intel chiefs say they don’t believe Iran is working to build one.

• On climate change. Trump once called it a “hoax”; the intel chiefs say the possible “irreversible damage” caused by it may create significant security challenges in the future as people compete for resources.

Coats also warned that Russia and other foreign countries will likely use new tactics to target the 2020 elections.

3. Venezuela

Nicolas Maduro is ready to talk. The Venezuelan President said he’s willing to meet with opposition leaders and international mediators to bring an end to the country’s political turmoil. But he ruled out holding new presidential elections until 2025. Maduro was re-elected to a six-year term last year in elections that many have called illegitimate. Meanwhile, Juan Guaido — the leader of the democratically elected Venezuelan National Assembly who last week declared himself the country’s interim president — finds himself under investigation. His assets will be frozen, and he can’t leave the country during the probe.

4. Las Vegas mass shooting

Why did Stephen Paddock break two windows in his suite at the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas and then indiscriminately fire on a crowd gathered for a country music festival? We may never know. The FBI has wrapped its investigation into the October 1, 2017, massacre that left 58 people dead in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. The agency found no clear motive for the attack. The FBI did say Paddock’s actions were inspired in part by a desire to obtain “a certain degree of infamy via a mass casualty attack.”

5. ‘Empire’ star attack

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked in Chicago by two people who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and put a noose around his neck. Chicago police have started a hate crime investigation. Smollett, who identifies as gay, took himself to the hospital and is in good condition. No description of the suspects has been put out yet, and police say they haven’t found any video evidence yet of the reported attack. They are expanding their search for clues from the neighborhood where Smollett said the attack happened to the Chicago riverfront. Hollywood rallied behind Smollett after word of the attack broke out.

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was reported to be in good condition after taking himself to a hospital after the incident early on Tuesday, police said.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police said in a statement.

Police did not identify Smollett by name, but gave his age and said he had a role on “Empire.” The show’s co-creator, Lee Daniels, and representatives from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment confirmed he was the victim.

“We have to love each other, regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united,” Daniels said in a profanity-laced video on his Instagram account.

“Hold your head up Jussie,” Lee added.

The two unknown assailants, police said, approached Smollett on the street about 2 a.m. CST and began a “possible racially motivated” attack, yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

The assailants hit him in the face, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives were gathering video of the area and looking for witnesses.

A representative for Smollett did not respond to requests for comment.

“Empire,” a hip-hop musical drama series, premiered on Fox Television in 2015. Its lead actress, Taraji P. Henson, won a Golden Globe Award in 2016 for her role and the show has received multiple Emmy Award nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Smollett’s colleagues said they were shocked.

“The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,” Empire co-creator Danny Strong said on Twitter.

Raquel Willis, an African-American transgender rights activist and executive editor of Out magazine, a lifestyle publication that centers on the LGBT community, condemned the attack on Twitter.

“The hate that fuels white supremacy is the same hate that fuels homophobia,” Willis said. “A conscientious society realizes it’s at war with both.”

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Gov. Tom Wolf is renewing his call for lawmakers to toughen Pennsylvania’s gun laws, after a truck driver walked into a Pittsburgh synagogue and fatally shot 11 people. The Democratic governor spoke Tuesday at an anti-gun violence rally in the Capitol. He was joined by the wife of a man badly wounded in Oct. 27’s synagogue shooting and a trauma surgeon who helped treat the victims.

The Republican-controlled Legislature last year passed legislation forcing people in Pennsylvania with a domestic violence ruling against them to more quickly surrender their guns. However, the Legislature has long resisted gun-control measures, such as expanding background checks. The House’s Republican majority leader, Bryan Cutler, says Pennsylvania already has fairly comprehensive background checks and says policymakers instead might find agreement on mental health interventions.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania’s Senate is resuming a push to make the Eastern hellbender the state’s official amphibian, an effort to highlight the plight of a creature whose numbers researchers say are declining because of pollution in rivers and streams. The bill emerged unanimously Tuesday from a Senate committee. A previous bill died last year in the House, where it encountered competing legislation promoting the Wehrle’s salamander.

According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the hellbender is an aquatic salamander that can grow up to two feet long, making them the largest North American amphibian. They are nocturnal and prefer shallow, fast streams with rocks to live under. Wehrle’s salamander legislation hasn’t been re-introduced. The common salamander is a few inches in length and found in upland forests across the eastern United States.

PITTSBURGH (AP) – Hate crimes charged in Pittsburgh synagogue massacre case. A man accused of opening fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue in October, killing 11 people and wounding seven others, now faces additional counts that include allegations of hate crimes. A federal grand jury Tuesday added 19 charges to the 44 counts previously levied against Robert Bowers of Baldwin, Pennsylvania.

Thirteen of the new counts against the 46-year-old Bowers are hate crime violations and the others accuse him of obstructing religious beliefs and discharging a firearm during crimes of violence. Messages left for Bowers’ lawyers weren’t immediately returned. Bowers had previously pleaded not guilty to counts including using a firearm to commit murder and obstruction of religious exercise resulting in death. Prosecutors say they’ve added a wounded officer to the allegations, making a total of five. Two congregants were also injured.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A new report says Pennsylvania should adopt a number of improvements to make its elections more secure, encouraging the replacement of older voting machines, enhanced security of voter lists and better planning for cyberattacks and other technological challenges. The Blue Ribbon Commission on Pennsylvania’s Election Security report issued Tuesday says the General Assembly should do more to help counties pay for machines that produce a voter-marked paper record.

The commission also is endorsing mandatory postelection audits. The group warns that the United States’ adversaries will be increasing efforts to influence the election system during the coming 2020 presidential contest. About four in five Pennsylvania voters use machines that lack an auditable paper trail, although state officials have directed counties to have paper-record voting machines in place by next year.

ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania health officials have confirmed the first child flu-related death of this year’s flu season. The Morning Call reports the state Department of Health announced the child’s death in its weekly influenza report for the week ending Jan. 26. The child’s name and age have not been released. Health officials say there have been 25 adult flu-related deaths so far, an increase of 10 from its report two weeks ago.

The health department continues to classify the flu as widespread in the state, with the southeast and northwest regions hit the hardest. There have been a total of 19,757 laboratory-confirmed flu cases this season.

Last year’s record flu season saw a total of 121,300 cases and 256 deaths.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A five-term Republican state senator from western Pennsylvania says he’s leaving his seat with two years left in his term. Sen. Don White of Indiana County announced Tuesday that he’ll resign at the end of February. He’ll become the third Republican state senator to depart this year. The 69-year-old White was first elected in 2000 and is the longtime chairman of the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee.

There’s an April 2 special election to fill an open seat in suburban Pittsburgh vacated by Congress-bound Guy Reschenthaler. Meanwhile, Sen. Rich Alloway of Franklin County announced he’s resigning at the end of February. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman must set a special election to fill White’s term through 2020. White’s district includes Armstrong and Indiana counties and parts of Butler and Westmoreland counties.

CHICAGO (AP) — Authorities in Chicago say they’re investigating the attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett as a hate crime. The actor says he was beaten by two men who shouted racist and anti-gay slurs. Police didn’t reveal Smollett’s name as the victim — but Fox, which airs “Empire,” did. Smollett, who’s 36, says he was walking near the Chicago River early yesterday when two men set upon him, shouting at him, hitting him in the face, pouring a liquid on him — and wrapping a rope around his neck. Smollett told police one man told him he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

UNDATED (AP) — Apple has decided to pull the plug on the group-chat function of its FaceTime service. The move comes after users reported a software bug could let callers activate another person’s microphone remotely. Because of the defect, a FaceTime user who calls another iPhone, iPad or Mac computer could hear the audio of the other device, even if the receiver doesn’t accept the call. Apple didn’t acknowledge the flaw until after people began demonstrating the problem through videos online. It’s more of an embarrassment to Apple because the company has tried to distinguish itself from other firms by stressing its commitment to users’ privacy.

LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Police dispatchers are trained to deal with a number of situations, and a dispatcher in Indiana had to know her numbers when a boy called 911 seeking help with his homework. Lafayette Police dispatcher Antonia Bundy answered the call from the boy, who said he had “a bad day at school.” It seemed the boy had “tons of homework” before the dispatcher narrowed down that he was having trouble with fractions.

An audio recording of the call posted on Twitter shows how the dispatcher helped the child solve the equation: three-fourths plus one-fourth. She had him take out a piece of paper to figure out the answer: one. The boy thanked the dispatcher and apologized for calling 911. Police say they don’t recommend calling 911 for homework help.

In Australia, temperatures reached 116 degrees Fahrenheit last week in Adelaide. The country has experienced drought for so long that some children have hardly experienced rain.

Over the years many individuals have fallen in love with unlikely people for reasons they cannot explain.

Such is the case of homosexuals who find peace in being in a same sex relationship. However in Africa and many other parts of the world, homosexuality is still frowned at by a number of people.

This does not stop gay individuals from coming out of the closet and living their truth. African- American actor Jussie Smollett, who became popular for his role as Jamal Lyon in drama series Empire, was recently attacked in a hate crime for being gay.

Jussie Smollett needed hospital treatment after two men punched him in the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, police said.

One of the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck before both fled the scene in the early hours of Tuesday.

Police said they were treating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Smollett has since been discharged from hospital, the TMZ website reported. Police described his condition as “good”.

The incident happened at East Lower Water Street, Chicago, at about 02:00 local time as the actor was leaving a restaurant.

“Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,” a police statement said.

The chemical substance poured on Smollett was not named, but some media reports said it was bleach.

“At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck,” the statement added.

Investigators are appealing for witnesses and any video of the incident.

Smollett, who plays a gay character in Empire, had earlier posted on Instagram that he was tired having arrived in Chicago after “seven hours on a plane for a two hour flight”.

Empire centres on a hip-hop music and entertainment company and the drama among the family members that run it.

Empire star Jussie Smollett was sent hate mail just eight days before he was attacked by two men in a racially-motivated assault.

The letter, which was sent to Fox studios in Chicago where Empire films, was made up of cut out letters and read: ‘You will die black f**.’

It is thought that the FBI had already been contacted and was investigating the letter before the attack that took place on Monday 28 February.

The envelope also has the word MAGA written in the child-like handwriting.

It has also been claimed that Fox offered Jussie security following the arrival of the letter but he turned it down.

Sources close to Jussie alleged to TMZ that security for the entire cast ‘was increased last week’ and that they wanted ‘to give Jussie additional protection around the clock’ but he said no ‘because it was an intrusive way of living’.

The Empire actor was ‘brutally attacked’ by two men wearing ski masks at around 2am on Tuesday morning in an incident police are investigating as a ‘possible hate crime’.

The 35-year-old actor had arrived in the city late on Monday and headed to Subway for food at around 2am, when he was approached by two men in ski masks.

It has been claimed the men in question asked him: ‘Aren’t you that f****t Empire n*****?’ before beating him, ‘putting a rope around his neck and pouring bleach on him’. They reportedly screamed: ‘This is MAGA country,’ as they walked away.

It is thought Jussie still had a rope around his neck when he made contact with Chicago PD and in a follow up interview he confirmed they yelled ‘MAGA country’.

MAGA stands for Make America Great Again, President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan and which is now used as a not-so-subtle code by white supremacists and racists.

What you need to know to start your day. The acting attorney general signaled that the Mueller probe is nearly finished.

It's Wednesday, Jan. 30, 2019. Let's start here.

1. Barr confirmation vote delayed

The Senate Judiciary Committee's vote on attorney general nominee William Barr has been delayed a week as Democrats seek more answers on how he'd handle special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russia.

""They're laser-focused right now on the report,"" ABC News' Devin Dwyer tells us. ""What will come out? Can the public see all of it? They want to make sure that the next attorney general commits to that.""

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle also have questioned comments made by acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who said this week the Russia probe is ""close to being completed"" and that he hoped a report would be produced ""as soon as possible.""

""I don't know why he knows that,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters on Tuesday. ""Mueller will be allowed to finish his job. That's the goal, that's going to happen. I don't know how you say that in light of the grand jury being extended six months.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also shared concerns, adding, ""I think Mr. Mueller should speak for himself.""

2. Intel chiefs contradict Trump

Top U.S. intelligence officials were on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to present an assessment of global threats to the nation, and much of what they said contradicted the president.

On North Korea, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told the Senate Intelligence Committee the country is ""unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons,"" and CIA Director Gina Haspel said the North ""is committed to developing a long-range armed missile that would pose a direct threat to the United States.""

Trump has said North Korea is ""no longer a nuclear threat,"" and he's expected to attend a second summit with Kim Jong Un next month.

The officials' ""Worldwide Threat Assessment"" also included warnings on Russia's attempts to influence elections and the continuing threat of ISIS.

""I think right now,"" ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz tells us, ""you've got Donald Trump saying a lot of things and the intelligence community and others acting on them in a different way.""

3. 'Empire' star attacked in possible hate crime

Authorities in Chicago are investigating a possible hate crime after ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett was attacked early Tuesday.

Police said Smollett was out getting food when he was approached by ""two unknown offenders"" who allegedly covered their faces and were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.""

The openly gay actor was then beat up, according to police, and an ""unknown chemical"" was poured on him. At some point during the incident, the two men ""wrapped a rope around [his] neck,"" officials said.

As investigators search for evidence and video related to the incident, ABC News' Steve Osunsami tells us law enforcement officials are looking into a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was delivered about a week and a half ago.

Yesterday, the number of confirmed measles cases in Clark County, Washington, grew to at least 36, and officials said two people in Hawaii now have the disease after contracting it in the Pacific Northwest.

A photograph of a hate letter sent to the 35-year-old actor shows Jussie's name written on the envelope in a thick red scrawl, with two US stamps and what looks like the initials MAGA (Make America Great Again).

Sentences had been pieced together on paper inside, using words and letters cut from a magazine.

The letter says: ""You will d black f**"".

Police are now investigating the early morning attack in Chicago on Tuesday as a hate crime after racist thugs in ski masks put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him in a brutal street attack.

They reportedly shouted: ""This is MAGA country.

He was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, but has since been released while Chicago PD are investigating the incident as battery.

Jussie came out as gay in March 2015 during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

He later told Attitude magazine: ""I get tired of the idea of someone telling me what my truth is.

""I've said from the beginning of my journey: I do not hide who I am. I love who I love.

""I am told so many times that I should not walk truly in my blackness,"" he continued. ""That I should not walk truly in my sexuality, I should not walk truly in who I am. I say thanks but no thanks, f**k you and goodbye.

""I honestly think that me being myself has actually helped my career move forward.""

The 36-year-old actor was exiting a restaurant in Chicago when two men started shouting racial and homophobic slurs towards him before attacking Smollett, according to The Hollywood Reporter. They punched him, poured an unknown chemical substance over him and one of the suspects even wrapped a rope around the actor’s neck.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said in a statement to THR. The police said the suspects were two males in black clothing. One of them was wearing a black mask.

Smollett, who was hospitalised for his injuries, told the police that the attackers yelled pro-“Make America Great Again” (MAGA) comments during the attack, such a “MAGA country!”

On the show, Smollett plays musician Jamal Lyon, the son of Lucious, played by Terrence Howard and Cookie enacted by Taraji P Henson. The character is gay so is the actor in real life. The show’s team has expressed shock and anger over the attack on Smollett. Empire co-creator Lee Daniels said the actor did not deserve what happened to him.

“It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie, you are my son. You didn’t deserve, nor anyone deserves, to have a noose put around your neck; to have bleach thrown on you ... you are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are,” Daniels said.

Co-creator Danny Strong said: “I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett. He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live. Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

Brian Grazer, the executive producer of the show, said he was “disgusted and saddened by the attack” on Smollett, adding, “Hate and bigotry have no place in our society.”"

But conflicting versions of the incident from Smollett himself, and details reported by the media being outright contradicted by Chicago Police have raised questions about what actually happened.

Debra Heine noted on the PJ Media last night that police had found surveillance video of Smollett, but had not been able to find video of the alleged assailants.

The explosive details of the incident were initially broadcast by TMZ:

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett was brutally attacked by 2 men who beat him up, put his head in a noose and screamed, “This is MAGA country.” Sources directly connected to Jussie tell TMZ, the actor arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday, and at around 2 AM he was hungry and went to a Subway. We’re told when shortly after he walked out on his way home, someone yelled, “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****?” The 2 men — both white and wearing ski masks — viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, “This is MAGA country.” Jussie took himself to Northwestern Memorial where he was treated. He was discharged later Tuesday morning.

The TMZ article now features a FaceTime screenshot of Smollett in the hospital taken by Empire creator Lee Daniels that Fields had initially posted online but then removed.

Chicago Police issued this initial statement:

The Chicago Police issued subsequent statements denying TMZ’s claim that Smollett reported the suspects yelling “this is MAGA country.” However, Chicago Police later said that Smollett did reveal the detail in a second interview — taken after the TMZ story had spread:

The Daily Beast later reported that a Chicago Police spokesperson refuted TMZ’s claim of the defendants being male and white. The spokesperson stated the gender and race of the alleged assailants were unknown to Smollett because they were wearing ski masks and gloves.

Then other odd details began to emerge, further clouding the situation.

Chicago Police stated that they have yet to find any video evidence of any attackers or their vehicle:

Chicago Police do not have any video of the assailants and continue to look for surveillance video. Investigators heard the ""MAGA country"" claim in media reports and called Smollett again. In that supplemental interview he shared that info with police. 2/2 — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 30, 2019

Then a police spokesman said that when officers first arrived on the scene, nearly 45 minutes after the alleged attack, Smollett was still wearing the rope around his neck:

All of the above is attributable to a Chicago police spokesman. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 29, 2019

Smollett also asked the officers to turn off their body cameras when they entered the residence, a high-end apartment reportedly owned by his friend:

CPD spokesman says, per department policy, officers informed Smollett they were wearing activated body cameras. He did request the cameras to be turned off. 2/2 — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 30, 2019

Local media reported that Smollett was even reluctant to give police a statement initially, and refused ambulance transport. He later “self-transported” himself to Northwestern Hospital.

ABC News reported that “an unknown chemical substance” was used in the incident. There has been no police confirmation that it was bleach, as TMZ initially reported and many other media outlets shared.

Chicago Police stated that they are treating the incident as a potential hate crime, and that the FBI is assisting them in their investigation.

It should also be noted that Smollett has expressed animus toward President Trump going back years before he announced his campaign for the presidency:

I think someone should kick Donald Trumps ass… That's all. — Jussie Smollett (@JussieSmollett) December 15, 2011

Early last year he tweeted out this racially tinged invective targeting Trump:

Shut the hell up you bitch ass nigga. You will continue to run this country further into the ground and risk lives every time you breathe. You’re not the president. Just a dumpster full of hate. FOH. Sick to my stomach that literal shit currently represents America to the world. https://t.co/qoNWllmZIm — Jussie Smollett (@JussieSmollett) January 12, 2018

Given the shifting and sketchy details available so far, some have urged caution about the narrative getting ahead of the known facts of the situation:

But that warning has fallen on deaf ears. Politicians, Hollywood figures, and the usual racial grifters all tried to capitalize on the narrative:

What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie. https://t.co/o8ilPu68CM — Joe Biden (Text Join to 30330) (@JoeBiden) January 30, 2019

There is no such thing as “racially charged.” This attack was not “possibly” homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack. If you don’t like what is happening to our country, then work to change it. It is no one’s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes. https://t.co/QAi0IYtSeR — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 30, 2019

I’ve been trying to figure out all day what to say about the racist, homophobic, violence against @JussieSmollett. Not sure I can describe what I’m feeling in a neat & tidy tweet.

Being interviewed by WABC TV on the reported hate crime on #JussieSmollett in Chicago. It must be fully investigated and justice must be done. pic.twitter.com/ijdG2afvQm — Reverend Al Sharpton (@TheRevAl) January 30, 2019

To recap:

TMZ initially claimed Smollett was physically assaulted by two white males shouting “this is MAGA country” and anti-gay and racial slurs, and that they doused him with bleach and put a noose around his neck.

Chicago Police initially denied the “MAGA” claim based on their initial interview. Smollett only added that detail in a second interview, after it had already been widely reported.

Police spokesmen also said that since the assailants were wearing ski masks and gloves, their race and gender are unknown to Smollett.

When police officers arrived at the residence, Smollett was still wearing the rope around his neck 45 minutes after the incident, was reluctant to provide a statement, and asked for their body cameras to be turned off.

Police have been unable to obtain any video evidence of the assailants or their vehicle.

Smollett clearly has a long-standing axe to grind with President Trump.

Given recent incidents, it would seem prudent to allow law enforcement authorities to investigate the matter before leaping to conclusions or pushing highly charged political claims.

But this incident has already been politicized, and it’s unlikely that prudence and caution are going to prevail until more facts are known.

This article has been updated to correct the date of Smollett’s tweet criticizing President Trump. The tweet was sent January 2018, not 2019. The name of the creator of ‘Empire” has also been corrected."

The musician and Empire star was approached by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him at approximately 2am on Tuesday, according to a police statement provided to The Independent.

“The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” the statement reads.

Hart responded to the news on Twitter, writing: “Sending prayers your way @JussieSmollett.... This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards.... this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world????”.

The comedian recently stepped down from hosting this year’s Oscars after past tweets in which he made homophobic statements resurfaced. He later embarked on an apology tour, and “sincerely apologised” to the LGBTQ community for his words.

The 35-year-old actor, who is black and came out as gay in 2015, was approached by two men in downtown Chicago at about 2am yesterday, police said.

He was struck in the face before having an “unknown chemical substance” poured over him and a rope wrapped around his neck, according to investigators.

The suspects shouted racial and homophobic slurs during the attack, police said. No arrests have been made.

Police also confirmed Smollett told them his attackers made reference to MAGA - Make America Great Again - which was Donald Trump’s slogan during the 2016 US presidential campaign.

Smollett has starred on Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul.

Smollett took himself to Chicago’s Northwestern Hospital and “is in good condition”, police said.

Following the attack, Ariana Grande was among the celebrities to offer support.

Grande said the incident left her “sick to my stomach” and sent, “all of the healing energy / love i possibly can and hoping for change”.

Grande added: “What can we do ? tell me & i’m there.”

Actress Olivia Munn wrote on Twitter the attack was, “why we have to have zero tolerance against homophobia and racism. Jussie’s life matters”.

Alyssa Milano said she was struggling to put her feelings into a “neat & tidy tweet”, adding, “Living together on the planet shouldn’t be this difficult”.

Michael B Jordan wrote on Instagram: “Stand with my brother jussiesmollett sending you light and love. Be strong We got you.”

Queer Eye host Jonathan Van Ness said “queer people are attacked every single day”, adding: “We have not come as far as we think.”

US president Trump is yet to comment, despite pressure to do so. Earlier Empire creator Lee Daniels reacted to the attack and said “America is better than that”.

In an emotional video to Instagram, Daniels called Smollett his “son”, before calling for change."

Empire star Jussie Smollett was attacked on Tuesday morning while leaving a restaurant in what Chicago police are calling a possible hate crime.

The 36-year-old actor was exiting a restaurant in Chicago when two men started shouting racial and homophobic slurs towards him before attacking Smollett, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

They punched him, poured an unknown chemical substance over him and one of the suspects even wrapped a rope around the actor’s neck.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said in a statement to THR.

The police said the suspects were two males in black clothing. One of them was wearing a black mask.

Smollett, who was hospitalised for his injuries, told the police that the attackers yelled pro-“Make America Great Again” (MAGA) comments during the attack, such a “MAGA country!”

On the show, Smollett plays musician Jamal Lyon, the son of Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie (Taraji P Henson). The character is gay, so is the actor in real life.

The show’s team has expressed shock and anger over the attack on Smollett.

Empire co-creator Lee Daniels said the actor did not deserve what happened to him.

“It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie, you are my son. You didn’t deserve, nor anyone deserves, to have a noose put around your neck; to have bleach thrown on you … you are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are,” Daniels said.

Co-creator Danny Strong said, “I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett. He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live. Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

Brian Grazer, the executive producer of the show, said he was “disgusted and saddened by the attack” on Smollett, adding, “Hate and bigotry have no place in our society.

""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett didn't want to be encumbered by an entourage of bodyguards when he wasn't working ... despite an offer by Fox a week before the brutal attack.

Sources close to the situation tell us ... security for the ""Empire"" cast was increased last week after Fox Studios, in Chicago, received that threatening, homophobic letter addressed to Smollett.

We're told Fox made the call to beef up security for everyone on set and wanted to give Jussie additional protection around the clock ... but, he declined. Our sources say he made the decision to not have extra security during off-hours because it was an intrusive way of living.

We broke the story ... the actor was brutally attacked by 2 men in Chicago after he arrived late Monday from New York, and made a 2 AM run to Subway for food. The 2 men -- both white and wearing ski masks -- beat Jussie, put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him. As they left the injured actor, the men screamed, ""MAGA country.""

Our ""Empire"" production sources tell us Jussie will have 24/7 armed security going forward ... at least until the 2 thugs are apprehended.

Smollett missed shooting on Tuesday as he recovered from his injuries, but we're told he plans to return soon, and the show will go on as planned ... although, the shooting schedule will be reshuffled to accommodate Jussie."

Smollett was attacked by two people who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” and “poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” police said.

One of Smollett’s alleged attackers also put a rope around his neck, according to police. Both fled the scene.

Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital and “is in good condition,” authorities said.

As of Tuesday evening, a Chicago police spokesperson told CNN that investigators canvassed the neighborhood where the reported attack occurred and have found no still images or video from security cameras of the incident.

The only image of Smollett police obtained from security cameras was inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime. The actor was seen standing alone.

Chicago police detectives continue to investigate the “serious allegations,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said early Wednesday.

“The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras. As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders,” he said.

“Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect’s vehicle to be able to share.”

Guglielmi said detective teams will broaden their search area and work around the clock to look for video on traffic cameras, buses and neighboring streets.

A dozen police detectives, with the assistance of the FBI, are working the case, he said.

CNN’s Don Lemon spoke to Smollett and a mutual friend who was at the hospital with the actor. Smollett confirmed the incident took place.

He was shaken and angry that an attack like this could happen. Smollett told CNN he fought back at the attackers.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” the police statement said.

Investigators are testing the chemical Smollett said he was doused with and have yet to confirm the nature of the substance.

Smollett has starred on Fox’s “Empire” since 2015. He plays Jamal, a successful singer in the musical Lyon family. Like his character, Smollett identifies as gay.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our ‘Empire’ family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” a representative of 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to CNN. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

A representative for GLAAD told CNN the organization has reached out Smollett to offer assistance and support.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” a GLAAD spokesperson said in a statement.

Celebrities and lawmakers showed an outpouring of love and support for actor and LGBT rights advocate Jussie Smollett on Wednesday after he was allegedly attacked in a possible hate crime in Chicago.

Taraji P. Henson, his ""Empire"" co-star who plays his mother on the show, shared a heartbreaking note on Instagram, writing that she wished what happened to Smollett was ""just one big bad joke.""

""We all feel his pain right now,"" she added. ""@jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!!""

The acclaimed actress and producer explained how her ""baby"" is resilient and will be back from this horrible incident.

""Love still lives in him,"" she added. ""The love so many have him just goes to show HE IS LOVE!!!! ... I LOVE YOU MY BABY MY BABY!!!""

Other superstars like Janet Jackson, Cher and Ellen DeGeneres also tweeted words of encouragement for the 36-year-old ""Empire"" actor after news broke that he'd been attacked by two men who allegedly placed a noose around his neck.

Jackson posted an image of herself and Smollett on Twitter Tuesday afternoon, telling the actor that she was sending him love and prayers along with a purple heart emoji.

DeGeneres also showed her support for Smollett.

""Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show. I’m sending him and his family so much love today,"" she tweeted.

Cher struck a much more serious chord in her tweet, calling the attack a example of the ""villainy, racism and homophobia"" that's plaguing America.

Author and ""Fix My Life"" coach Iyanla Vanzant struck a similar tone in her tweet on Tuesday.

""Let us call 'a thing' a 'thing'! A noose around the neck is for lynching. Bleach turns black to white,"" Vanzant said. ""Whether or not it was MAGA, it was violent and racist and homophobic- - - PERIOD! Lift Jussie in prayer and find the racist homophobes -PERIOD!""

Well-known lawmakers and politicians, including Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and former Vice President Joe Biden, also tweeted support for Smollett, while others used the moment as opportunity to speak out against racism and homophobia.

""Jussie is my friend - a very talented & beautiful human being. It is so hurtful that homophobic haters would dare hurt someone so loving and giving,"" Waters said in a tweet. ""I'm dedicated to finding the culprits and bringing them to justice. Jussie did not deserve to be harmed by anyone!""

""The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love,"" Pelosi added in a tweet of her own. ""I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all,"" Pelosi added in a tweet of her own.

What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country.

Smollett was treated and released from a Chicago-area hospital after the Tuesday morning attack and was reportedly recovering at home.

The singer told police the men hit him, poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him (possibly bleach), and wrapped a rope around his neck, Smollett told police. The rope was still around Smollett's neck when he was found, officials said.

In a follow-up interview later, he told investigators that the suspects yelled ""MAGA country"" during the attack.

Here's a look at some of the other politicians and Hollywood stars who condemned the violent attack.

Jussie - who is known for playing Jamal Lyon in the show - is thought to have arrived in Chicago from New York on Monday evening and headed out for food at 2am when he got hungry.

The actor, 35, was ambushed at 2am on Tuesday in Chicago by two men wearing ski masks who put a noose around his neck and poured the chemicals over him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs, according to TMZ.

And now show bosses are determined to make sure their other stars remain unharmed.

An emergency meeting was held on Tuesday while some actors had already arrived on set for filming, according to Entertainment Tonight.

A statement from Fox said: ""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

""The entire studio, network and production stand united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.""

Jussie - who is known for playing Jamal Lyon in the show - is thought to have arrived in Chicago from New York on Monday evening and headed out for food at 2am when he got hungry.

TMZ claims he went to sandwich store Subway and when he walked out he was racially abused by someone who recognised him from Empire.

The men, who TMZ claim were both white, then attacked him and fractured a rib, as Jussie tried to fight back.

They then reportedly put a rope around his neck and covered him in bleach, while shouting ""This is MAGA country"" (Make America Great Again).

Jussie was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, but has since been released while Chicago PD are investigating the incident at battery.

Chicago PD told TMZ: ""[We] received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire.

Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Another reports from ThatGrapeJuice.net claims Jussie recently received an intimating letter, which read: “You will die black f**”.

Jussie came out as gay in March 2015 during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

He later told Attitude magazine: ""I get tired of the idea of someone telling me what my truth is. I've said from the beginning of my journey: I do not hide who I am. I love who I love. No one is going to tell me that somehow that is going to be my disability.""

""I am told so many times that I should not walk truly in my blackness,"" he continued.

""That I should not walk truly in my sexuality, I should not walk truly in who I am. I say thanks but no thanks, f**k you and goodbye. I honestly think that me being myself has actually helped my career move forward.""

The 36-year-old actor was exiting a restaurant in Chicago when two men started shouting racial and homophobic slurs towards him before attacking Smollett, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

They punched him, poured an unknown chemical substance over him and one of the suspects even wrapped a rope around the actor's neck.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" police said in a statement to THR.

The police said the suspects were two males in black clothing. One of them was wearing a black mask.

Smollett, who was hospitalised for his injuries, told the police that the attackers yelled pro-""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) comments during the attack, such a ""MAGA country!""



On the show, Smollett plays musician Jamal Lyon, the son of Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie (Taraji P Henson). The character is gay so is the actor in real life.

The show's team has expressed shock and anger over the attack on Smollett.

""Empire"" co-creator Lee Daniels said the actor did not deserve what happened to him.

""It's taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie, you are my son. You didn't deserve, nor anyone deserves, to have a noose put around your neck; to have bleach thrown on you ... you are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are,"" Daniels said.

Co-creator Danny Strong said, ""I'm deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett. He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live. Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.""



Brian Grazer, the executive producer of the show, said he was ""disgusted and saddened by the attack"" on Smollett, adding, ""Hate and bigotry have no place in our society.

American movie star Jussie Smollett, who is well known for his role as Jamal Lyon in drama series Empire, has been quite open about being a gay man.

However, that led to him being attacked and badly injured by some homophobes in Chicago on January 29.

US Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have called the suspected homophobic and racist attack on gay actor Jussie Smollett “an attempted modern-day lynching.”

The Empire star was hospitalised after being targeted in the early hours of Tuesday morning (January 29) in Chicago.

Smollett was reportedly beaten by two men in the incident, during which he had a chemical substance poured on him, a rope wrapped around his neck, and was subjected to homophobic slurs.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told local TV station ABC7 that according to Smollett, his attackers yelled “MAGA country” during the assault.

MAGA is the acronym for President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, Make America Great Again.

Politicians condemn attack on Jussie Smollett and send support

In their messages of support, Booker and Harris urged their fellow politicians to pass the anti-lynching bill they co-sponsored in the Senate.

Booker, a New Jersey Senator, tweeted: “The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe.

“To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime–I urge you to pay attention.”

“This was an attempted modern-day lynching. No-one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or colour of their skin.” — Kamala Harris

Harris, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said: “Jussie Smollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery.

“This was an attempted modern-day lynching. No-one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or colour of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

Multiple high-ranking Democratic lawmakers have spoken up in support of Smollett, who came out as gay on The Ellen Degeneres Show in 2015.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted: “The racist, homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love.

“I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden said that “what happened today to Jussie Smollett must never be tolerated in this country.

“We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbour; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.”

California congresswoman Maxine Waters said: “Jussie is my friend—a very talented & beautiful human being.

“It is so hurtful that homophobic haters would dare hurt someone so loving and giving. I’m dedicated to finding the culprits and bringing them to justice.

“Jussie did not deserve to be harmed by anyone!”"

Celebrities like Kerry Washington and Viola Davis have condemned the attack on Smollett.

But Bobrisky, who is in the spotlight and known for her frivolous, tongue-in-cheek statements, has dragged a homophobe on Instagram after she commented on the Smollett incident. And we are here for it. Bob expressed her how pained and heartbroken she was upon hearing about the attack, and sent her love and prayers to Smollett.

Ariana Grande has become the latest celebrity to unveil a new tattoo this week but she may have a slight problem on her hands.

The Thank U, Next singer appears to have gotten a tattoo right in the palm of her hand in either Chinese or Japanese characters.

But there’s debate over the meaning with some of Ari’s fans stating it means ‘7 rounds’ or ‘7 wheels’ likely in celebration of her latest single 7 Rings. However, others say the Japanese translation means, ahem, ‘BBQ grill’.

Guess Ari really loves chicken wings.

Los Angeles-based tattoo artist Kane Navasard shared a photo of the popstar’s supposed new ink on Instagram with the caption: ‘If you didn’t know, @arianagrande is a G. #tattoo #singleneedle #losangeles #forthesinners.’

Ariana, 25, isn’t seen in the photo but a woman’s outstretched hand wearing a thick jumper is seen with the tattoo right in the middle of her hand. According to Inquisitr, Ari had posted a similar photo on her right hand side while there might or could be others who said it otherwise and then some to it.

Ari had posted a similar photo on her Twitter account with a caption that said getting the tattoo done felt great and jokingly added she was ‘just kidding’.

Another reason why I can't listen to Ariana Grande's music: language is an aesthetic in her world. Also, the top of your foot is more painful & I've still seen people get a full color tat there so that's the worst excuse I've heard for getting a half assed crappy tattoo but okay. pic.twitter.com/mSMSMxLahd — Lynn is too broke to be an ELF bye bye ??? (@RyeowooksThighs) January 30, 2019

In response to a follower who mentioned the BBQ grill translation and the fact the tattoo appears to be missing some characters, Ariana reportedly replied: ‘Indeed, I left out [Japanese characters] which should have gone in between. It hurt like fuck n still looks tight.

‘I wouldn’t have lasted one more symbol lmao. But this spot also peels a ton and won’t last so if I miss it enough, I’ll suffer thru the whole thing next time.’

If you go by the reported Chinese meaning, it’s no surprise Ari wanted to pay homage to her latest single, 7 Rings, which is number one in both the UK and US and is expected to hold onto the top spot for a second week on this side of the pond.

The track will feature on Ari’s forthcoming fifth studio album Thank U, Next, which follows on from her most recent LP, 2018’s Sweetener.

Stars are showing their support for actor Jussie Smollett after he was the victim of a suspected hate crime in Chicago.

The 35-year-old Empire actor was attacked by two men ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"", police say.

He was hit in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope was wrapped around his neck.

Jussie has told police his attackers also made reference to ""MAGA"" (Make America Great Again).

The slogan was used by Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential campaign.

Oscar winner Viola Davis and supermodel Naomi Campbell are among those sharing their support.

Naomi Campbell, who starred in the first two seasons of the musical show about a hip-hop mogul whose sons and ex-wife fight over his business, said that one of the most beautiful things to happen to her when working on Empire was meeting Jussie Smollett.

Alongside a picture of the two of them, she called on the Mayor of Chicago to catch the ""despicable people"" who have committed this ""act of hate"".

Oscar winner Viola Davis shared a photo of Jussie on her Instagram page.

Jussie, who plays Jamal Lyon, in Empire, came out on US TV show Ellen in 2015.

It's after he faced scrutiny in his personal life when his character on the show came out as being gay.

At the time he told Ellen ""there is, without a doubt, no closet that I've ever been in and I just wanted to make that clear"".

The TV host tweeted her support for him and his family.

Jussie's co-star, Grace Byers, is among those expressing their horror at the attack.

""This despicable act only shamefully reveals how deeply the diseases of hatred, inequality, racism and discrimination continue to course through our country's veins,"" she said.

Lee Daniels, the creator of Empire, posted an emotional video on Instagram supporting Jussie, in which he called him ""my son"".

""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck.

""America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united.

""Hold your head up Jussie. I'm with you,"" he said.

American comedian and presenter Steve Harvey also posted a video for Jussie on Instagram,calling him ""little brother"" and saying a lot of people are backing him.

""This ain't about sexual preference or nothing. This is about coming to the aid of another brother that has tasted the brutality of hatred and racism and bigotry.""

Singer and actress Janelle Monae also shared a photo of herself with Jussie.

""It is still a risk daily to be a BLACK, OUT and PROUD human being,"" she wrote.

Jada Pinkett Smith also posted a news report about the attack.

Some media reports say that the actor had bleach poured on him but that's not been confirmed yet.

According to the American website TMZ, Jussie has now been discharged from hospital.

Black, openly-gay actor Jussie Smollett of the US television program Empire was hospitalised on 29 January in Chicago following a possibly hate-motivated attack in which assailants tied a rope around his neck, police and his co-workers said.

News of the early morning attack left the entertainment world reeling and gay advocacy groups speaking out in support of the 36-year-old actor.

Smollett was beaten at around 2:00 am by two attackers who yelled ""racial and homophobic slurs"" while he walked downtown in the third-biggest US city, said police, who did not name him but said the victim was an actor from Empire.

Smollett's fellow cast members and production company identified him as the victim.

TMZ had reported that the assailants had shouted, ""This is Maga country"". They had then poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, and then wrapped a rope around the actor's neck, according to police.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" the Chicago Police Department said.

The actor and singer was reportedly in Chicago for a scheduled Saturday concert.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, who on the weekend launched her 2020 campaign to be America's first black female president, called the incident ""an attempted modern day lynching.""

""No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate,"" Harris said on Twitter.

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

Members of the Empire production team and cast, as well as the studio that produces the program, also spoke out.

""The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate -- and especially against one of our own,"" 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.

The show's co-creator Lee Daniels posted an Instagram video calling Jussie ""my son.""

""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,"" Daniels said, addressing the actor.

""Hold your head up Jussie. I'm with you. I'll be there in a minute. It's just another f****ng day in America,"" he said.

Advocacy groups including the The Trevor Project and the American Civil Liberties Union, quickly offered their support as well.

""LGBTQ people of color live at multiple intersections of oppression, too often facing violence compounded by both racism and homophobia,"" the ACLU said.

""This isn't the America we want to live in.""

According to the police account, they then struck him in the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him before one wrapped a rope around his neck.

Smollett went to Northwestern Memorial hospital. Police said he was being treated and was in good condition.

Trump warned of Afghan pullout risks

WASHINGTON (AP) - Trump administration claims of progress in talks with the Taliban have sparked fears even among the president's allies that his impatience with the war in Afghanistan will lead him to withdraw troops too soon, leaving the country at risk of returning to the same volatile condition that prompted the invasion in the first place.

Discussions between a U.S. envoy and the Taliban are advancing weeks after the administration said it wanted to begin drawing down troops in Afghanistan. That has prompted some critics to note that President Donald Trump is telegraphing a withdrawal - the same thing he accused President Barack Obama of doing by saying he wanted to end the American combat mission in 2014.

""It's an effort to put lipstick on what will be a U.S. withdrawal,"" said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul under Obama.

A negotiated settlement to America's longest war poses a dilemma for Trump. He has often declared he wants to end lengthy overseas military entanglements, something he made clear in December by declaring the Islamic State group defeated in Syria and announcing he was pulling 2,000 American troops from that country over the objections of his top foreign policy advisers.

The stakes are higher in Afghanistan, a conflict that has cost 2,400 American lives and hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars. The U.S. invaded the country to oust the Taliban and al-Qaida in October 2001 in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the CIA director warned as recently as Tuesday that Afghanistan could once again become a terrorist haven.

Polar blast envelops Midwest, strains aging infrastructure

CHICAGO (AP) - A blast of polar air enveloped much of the Midwest on Wednesday, cracking train rails, breaking water pipes and straining electrical systems with some of the lowest temperatures in a generation.

The deep freeze closed schools and businesses and canceled flights in the nation's third-largest city, which was as cold as the Arctic. Heavily dressed repair crews hustled to keep utilities from failing.

Chicago dropped to a low of around minus 23 (minus 30 Celsius), slightly above the city's lowest-ever reading of minus 27 (minus 32 Celsius) from January 1985. Milwaukee had similar conditions. Minneapolis recorded minus 27 (minus 32 Celsius). Sioux Falls, South Dakota, saw minus 25 (minus 31 Celsius).

Wind chills reportedly made it feel like minus 50 (minus 45 Celsius) or worse. Downtown Chicago streets were largely deserted after most offices told employees to stay home. Trains and buses operated with few passengers. The hardiest commuters ventured out only after covering nearly every square inch of flesh against the extreme chill, which froze ice crystals on eyelashes and eyebrows in minutes.

The Postal Service took the rare step of suspending mail delivery in many places, and in southeastern Minnesota, even the snowplows were idled by the weather.

US: Mueller evidence used in disinformation campaign

WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal prosecutors say confidential material from the Russia investigation was altered and released online as part of a disinformation campaign to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, according to a court filing Wednesday.

The material had been handed over to defense attorneys for Concord Management and Consulting LLC, a Russian company that Mueller has charged with financing efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

But the files, which prosecutors say were not sensitive, surfaced online last year in a link posted by a pro-Russian Twitter account.

The prosecutors stopped short of accusing Concord of leaking the material, but they argue that the company's request to have sensitive new evidence sent to Russia ""unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.""

Concord is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as ""Putin's chef"" for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been hit with U.S. sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 election and is charged alongside his company in the indictment brought by Mueller.

Dems see future in Abrams as she prepares to rebut Trump

ATLANTA (AP) - Stacey Abrams will be doing more than rebutting President Donald Trump next week. As the first black woman to deliver a Democratic response to a State of the Union address, she'll represent what many in the party see as their political future.

In picking Abrams, the Georgian who narrowly lost her bid to be the nation's first African-American woman governor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is reflecting the party's hope to win future elections with appeals to women and people of color. He's also signaling the party's desire to make inroads in the diversifying South and Sun Belt after disappointing losses there during last year's midterms.

Abrams, 45, represents the growing political clout of black women. That's something Schumer wants to tap into by recruiting her to compete in next year's Georgia Senate race, a decision that could have national implications for Democrats if she successfully flips the seat and, in the process, turns out enough voters to make the Deep South state competitive at the presidential level.

Schumer and others ""understand the power and prowess and contributions of black women ... and choosing Stacey Abrams is the physical embodiment of that recognition,"" said Democratic strategist Symone Sanders.

The speech offers Abrams a high-profile launching pad to a Senate campaign. Though she hasn't decided whether she'll run, Schumer has spent the past several weeks courting Abrams to challenge first-term Republican Sen. David Perdue. She has also met with Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, chairwoman of Senate Democrats' 2020 campaign efforts, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Kamala Harris, a presidential contender who is currently the lone black woman in the Senate.

Opposition protesters fill streets of Venezuelan capital

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - Venezuelans of every age, class and profession poured into the streets of the capital on Wednesday to demand that President Nicolas Maduro step down and to express their support for the young opposition leader who has declared himself interim president.

Dressed in suits, scrubs, and jeans, they waved the national flag, displayed signs, and chanted slogans. One disgusted vendor threw devalued national currency into the air.

Protesters who made an appearance were heeding a call from opposition leader Juan Guaido to stage mass demonstrations despite crackdowns on previous protests.

Here are some scenes from across Caracas:

US secretly shipped plutonium from South Carolina to Nevada

RENO, Nev. (AP) - The U.S. Department of Energy revealed on Wednesday that it secretly shipped weapons-grade plutonium from South Carolina to a nuclear security site in Nevada months ago despite the state's protests.

The Justice Department notified a federal judge in Reno that the government trucked in the radioactive material to store at the site 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Las Vegas before Nevada first asked a court to block the move in November.

Department lawyers said in a nine-page filing that the previously classified information about the shipment from South Carolina can be disclosed now because enough time has passed to protect national security. They didn't specify when the one-half metric ton of plutonium was transferred.

Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said he's ""beyond outraged by this completely unacceptable deception."" He announced at a hastily called news conference in Carson City late Wednesday the state is now seeking another court order to block any more shipments of plutonium as it pursues ""any and all legal remedies,"" including contempt of court orders against the federal government.

The newly elected Democrat said he's exploring options for the plutonium that already has arrived and is working with Nevada's congressional delegation to fight back against the U.S. government's ""reckless disregard"" for the safety of Nevadans.

Rand Paul awarded more than $580K after neighbor's attack

U.S. Sen. Rand Paul was awarded more than $580,000 in damages and medical expenses on Wednesday in his lawsuit against the neighbor who tackled him and broke several of his ribs in a dispute over lawn maintenance.

A jury in Bowling Green, Kentucky, deliberated less than two hours before delivering the award to the Republican lawmaker who had been attacked while doing yard work at his Kentucky home.

Paul had testified during the three-day trial that he feared for his life as he struggled to breathe after Rene Boucher, an anesthesiologist by trade, slammed into him in their upscale Bowling Green neighborhood in late 2017.

The jury awarded $375,000 in punitive damages and $200,000 for pain and suffering, plus $7,834 for medical expenses.

Afterward, Paul said in a statement that he hoped the verdict would send a ""clear message that violence is not the answer - anytime, anywhere.""

E-cigs outperform patches and gums in quit-smoking study

WASHINGTON (AP) - A major new study provides the strongest evidence yet that vaping can help smokers quit cigarettes, with e-cigarettes proving nearly twice as effective as nicotine gums and patches.

The British research, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, could influence what doctors tell their patients and shape the debate in the U.S., where the Food and Drug Administration has come under pressure to more tightly regulate the burgeoning industry amid a surge in teenage vaping.

""We know that patients are asking about e-cigarettes and many doctors haven't been sure what to say,"" said Dr. Nancy Rigotti, a tobacco treatment specialist at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study. ""I think they now have more evidence to endorse e-cigarettes.""

At the same time, Rigotti and other experts cautioned that no vaping products have been approved in the U.S. to help smokers quit.

Smoking is the No. 1 cause of preventable death worldwide, blamed for nearly 6 million deaths a year. Quitting is notoriously difficult, even with decades-old nicotine aids and newer prescription drugs. More than 55 percent of U.S. smokers try to quit each year, and only about 7 percent succeed, according to government figures.

Parole recommended for Manson follower Leslie Van Houten

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A California panel on Wednesday recommended that Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten be paroled after serving more than four decades in prison.

After a hearing at the women's prison in Corona, California, commissioners of the Board of Parole Hearings found for the third time that the 69-year-old Van Houten was suitable for release.

If her case withstands a 150-day review process, it will rest in the hands of California's new Gov. Gavin Newsom. Van Houten was recommended for parole twice previously, but then-Gov. Jerry Brown blocked her release.

Van Houten was among the followers in Manson's murderous cult who stabbed to death wealthy grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in 1969. Van Houten was 19 during the killings, which came a day after other Manson followers killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others in Los Angeles.

Tate's sister attended Wednesday's proceedings and said afterward that she vehemently disagrees with the parole recommendation.

Police release photos of ""persons of interest"" in attack

CHICAGO (AP) - Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the ""persons of interest"" Wednesday evening.

Investigators ""for the most part"" can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects."

Police did not release the actor's name but a statement from Fox, which airs ""Empire,"" identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime. Smollett is black and openly gay.

According to a police statement, the actor was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an ""unknown substance"" on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that when officers first came in contact with Smollett, he still had a rope around his neck. While being interviewed by detectives, Guglielmi said Smollett told them that the attackers yelled he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The police spokesman added that the two men were wearing masks. Investigators have not found any surveillance video or witnesses from which they can put together a description of the offenders, he said.

Smollett was able to take himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was last reported in good condition.

Guglielmi also said the FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago last week.

The hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Jamal Lyon, Smollett's character, is the gay, middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Tuesday in support of Smollett. ""The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence,"" the statement read.

""Empire"" co-creator Lee Daniels also voiced his support for Smollett in an Instagram video.

""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,"" Daniels said. ""You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.""

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

""He is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I've ever met,"" Harris said Tuesday, adding that she's still learning more details about the incident.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues and he released his debut album, ""Sum of My Music,"" last year.

""Empire"" is shot in Chicago and a Fox spokeswoman said the program is currently in production.

We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows we united, on a united front.""

Jussie Smollett is thought to have still had a rope around his neck when he made contact with Chicago PD after a shocking racially aggravated attack.

The Empire actor was ‘brutally attacked’ by two men wearing ski masks at around 2am on Tuesday morning in an incident police are investigating as a ‘possible hate crime’.

The attackers are alleged to have beaten up Jussie, ‘put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him’.

Now sources close to Chicago PD have claimed that in a follow-up interviews in hospital, Jussie confirmed the attackers yelled ‘MAGA country’, which is now used as a not-so-subtle code by white supremacists and racists after being coined by President Donald Trump.

The 35-year-old actor had arrived in the city late on Monday and headed to Subway for food at around 2am, when he was approached by two men in ski masks.

It has been claimed the men in question asked him: ‘Aren’t you that f****t Empire n*****?’ before beating him, ‘putting a rope around his neck and pouring bleach on him’.

They reportedly screamed: ‘This is MAGA country,’ as they walked away.

Nine days ago Jussie was sent a letter in the post to Fox Studios which read: ‘You will die black f**.’

It is thought that the FBI had already been contacted and was investigating the letter before the attack.

Empire producers are now taking extra precautions to protect actors with filming reportedly continuing on the Fox series in Chicago under the protection of armed security staff.

Several of the actors are said to be ‘extremely upset’ by the news, while Empire boss Lee Daniels shared a public video urging the actor to ‘hold his head up’.

Metro.co.uk has contacted Chicago PD and reps for Jussie for comment.

News of the early morning attack left the entertainment world reeling and gay advocacy groups speaking out in support of the 36-year-old actor.

Smollett was beaten at around 2:00 am by two attackers who yelled ""racial and homophobic slurs"" while he walked downtown in the third-biggest US city, said police, who did not name him but said the victim was an actor from Empire.

Smollett's fellow cast members and production company identified him as the victim. The attackers poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, and then wrapped a rope around the actor's neck, according to police.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" the Chicago Police Department said.

The actor and singer was reportedly in Chicago for a scheduled Saturday concert.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, who on the weekend launched her 2020 campaign to be America's first black female president, called the incident ""an attempted modern day lynching.""

""No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or colour of their skin. We must confront this hate,"" Harris said on Twitter.

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery.

Members of the Empire production team and cast, as well as the studio that produces the program, also spoke out. ""The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate—and especially against one of our own,"" 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.

The show's co-creator Lee Daniels posted an Instagram video calling Jussie ""my son."" ""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,"" Daniels said, addressing the actor.

""Hold your head up Jussie. I'm with you. I'll be there in a minute. It's just another f****ng day in America,"" he said.

Advocacy groups including the The Trevor Project and the American Civil Liberties Union, quickly offered their support as well. ""LGBTQ people of colour live at multiple intersections of oppression, too often facing violence compounded by both racism and homophobia,"" the ACLU said.

""This isn't the America we want to live in.""

The deadly arctic deep freeze wreaking havoc across the United States has left at least six people dead with recording-breaking low temperatures halting postal services in the Midwest and cancelling more than 2,500 flights.

Two people died in Detroit, Michigan after temperatures started plummeting late Tuesday as forecasters issued grave warnings that the coldest spell in history would be life-threatening.

Police found a man's body across the street from his home in the Detroit area on Wednesday. He was not wearing a hat or gloves and wasn't dressed for below-zero temperatures. A 70-year-old man was also found dead in Detroit in front of a neighbor's home on Wednesday.

The polar vortex in the Midwest came on the heels of major Winter Storm Jayden that dumped up to a foot of snow on the region over the weekend and was to blame for at least four deaths - including a 55-year-old man who froze to death in his Milwaukee garage after he collapsed shoveling snow.

Officials have warned that the freezing temperatures will only become more life-threatening as the week progresses. Forecasters advised against breathing deeply or talking while outside and warned that frostbite and hypothermia issues could occur within seconds.

The frozen Arctic winds brought record-low temperatures across much of the Midwest on Wednesday, triggering widespread closures of hundreds of schools and businesses from North Dakota to Pennsylvania.

Plummeting temperatures in Chicago have forecasters predicting that the city will be colder than parts of Alaska, the North Pole and Antarctica by Wednesday night.

The National Weather service says the temperature in Chicago dropped early Wednesday to minus 19 degrees, which breaks the previous record low for the day that was set in 1966. Temperatures are expected drop as low as negative 28 degrees as the day progresses. Wind chills in northern Illinois made it feel as cold as negative 57F.

In comparison, temperatures are predicted to be in the teens and lows 20s at the US McMurdo Antarctic research station. Temperatures in the North Pole are expected to reach minus 20 degrees and Alaska is forecast to have high in the mid-teens.

The extreme weather conditions have prompted Amtrak to cancel all trains into and out of Chicago on Wednesday and most services to or from Chicago on Thursday. Crews had to set rail tracks in fire to keeps trains moving smoothly on Tuesday.

More than 2,500 flights were canceled early Wednesday, largely out of Chicago O'Hare and Chicago Midway international airports, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.

The U.S. Postal Service has also taken the rare step of suspending mail delivery to parts of Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, the Dakotas and Nebraska on Wednesday because of the dangerous Arctic blast.

Sub-zero temperatures already blanketing parts of Canada began sweeping across the Midwest and towards the East Coast on Tuesday evening.

The frigid winds were bound for the East Coast later on Wednesday into Thursday.

The National Weather Service forecast for Wednesday night predicted temperatures in Chicago as low as minus 28, with wind chills to minus 50. Detroit's outlook was for Wednesday overnight lows around minus 15, with wind chills dropping to minus 40.

Governors in Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan have all declared emergencies as the worst of the cold threatened on Wednesday.

'We need everyone to do your part and make sure you and your families are prepared,' said Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.

The bitter cold is the result of a split in the polar vortex that allowed temperatures to plunge much further south in North America than normal.

'These are actually a public health risk and you need to treat it appropriately,' Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Tuesday. 'They are life-threatening conditions and temperatures.'

At least four deaths were linked to the weather system, including a man struck and killed by a snow plow in the Chicago area, a young couple whose SUV struck another on a snowy road in northern Indiana and a Milwaukee man found frozen to death in a garage.

Officials in large Midwestern cities including Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago and Detroit were desperately trying to get the homeless off the streets.

Minneapolis charitable groups that operate warming places and shelters expanded hours and capacity, and ambulance crews handled all outside calls as being potentially life-threatening, according to Hennepin County Emergency Management Director Eric Waage.

MetroTransit said it wouldn't remove people from buses if they were riding them simply to stay warm, and weren't being disruptive.

Emanuel said Chicago was turning five buses into makeshift warming centers moving around the city, some with nurses aboard, to encourage the homeless to come in from the cold. About 160 warming centers were opened in the city.

'We're bringing the warming shelters to them, so they can stay near all of their stuff and still warm up,' said Cristina Villarreal, spokeswoman for the city's Department of Family and Support Services.

Shelters, churches and city departments in Detroit worked together to help get vulnerable people out of the cold, offering the message to those who refused help that 'you're going to freeze or lose a limb,' said Terra DeFoe, a senior adviser to Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.

Nineteen-year-old Deontai Jordan and dozens of others found refuge from the cold in the basement of a church in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

'You come here, you can take a nap, you can snack, you can use the bathroom, you might even be able to shower,' he said. 'And then they're feeding you well. Not to mention they give out clothes, they give out shoes, they give out socks.'

Hundreds of public schools and several large universities from North Dakota to Pennsylvania canceled classes on Tuesday and Wednesday. Closing schools for an extended stretch isn't an easy decision, even though most school districts build potential makeup days into their schedules, said Josh Collins, spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Education.

'Many students, they might have two working parents, so staying home might mean they're not supervised,' he said. 'For some low-income students, the lunch they receive at school might be their most nutritious meal of the day.'

American Indian tribes in the Upper Midwest were doing what they could to help members in need with heating supplies. Many people on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in the Dakotas live in housing that's decades old and in disrepair, or in emergency government housing left over from southern disasters such as hurricanes.

'They aren't made for this (northern) country. The cold just goes right through them,' said Elliott Ward, the tribe's emergency response manager.

The extreme cold was 'a scary situation' for the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, said Chris Fairbanks, manager of the northern Minnesota tribe's energy assistance program.

'We have many, many calls coming in. We're just swamped trying to get everybody what they need,' she said.

The cold was even shutting down typical outdoor activities. A ski hill in the Minneapolis area said it would close through Wednesday. So did an ice castle attraction.

The cold weather was even affecting beer deliveries, with a pair of western Wisconsin distributors saying they would delay or suspend shipments for fear that beer would freeze in their trucks.

The unusually frigid weather is attributed to a sudden warming far above the North Pole. A blast of warm air from misplaced Moroccan heat last month made the normally super chilly air temperatures above the North Pole rapidly increase.

That split the polar vortex into pieces, which then started to wander, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research.

One of those polar vortex pieces is responsible for the subzero temperatures across the Midwest this week.

Minnesota's Xcel Energy reported that equipment failures on power poles has led to outages throughout the Twin Cities. The outages started around 5.40pm and more than 3,000 people were still without power at 11pm Tuesday evening, according to CBS Minnesota.

The National Weather Service (NWS) Twin Cities reported that the area is experiencing the coldest temperatures since 1996.

'These are VERY DANGEROUS conditions and can lead to frostbite on exposed skin in as little as five minutes where wind chill values are below -50,' the NWS tweeted. 'Best thing you can do is limit your time outside.'

A wind chill of minus 25 can freeze skin within 15 minutes, according to the service.

The NWS have even warned that people should avoid taking deep breaths and talking outside to ensure lungs are protected from the severely cold air.

Temperatures in almost a dozen states stretching more than 1,200 miles from the Dakotas to Ohio were forecast to be the coldest in a generation, if not on record.

'One of the coldest arctic air mass intrusions in recent memory is surging south into the Upper Midwest before spreading across much of the eastern two-thirds of the country,' the NWS said.

'Expect frigid temperatures, bitterly cold and life-threatening wind chills, likely leading to widespread record lows and low maximum temperatures from the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.'

The NWS forecast temperatures between -10 to -40 degrees Fahrenheit by Wednesday across the Midwest, with wind chills making it seem as cold as -65 degrees Fahrenheit in one area of Minnesota.



In the northeastern and southern US, snow was falling. A cold emergency was declared in Washington, DC, with additional services put on for the homeless.

Scientists say climate change is causing more extreme weather, and one theory for polar vortex chills is that arctic air currents usually trapped around the North Pole are weakened and dislodged by a warming climate.

WHAT IS THE POLAR VORTEX? The polar vortex is an atmospheric circulation pattern that sits high above the poles, in a layer of the atmosphere called the stratosphere. This structure can weaken as a result of abnormal warming in the poles, causing it to split off into smaller ‘sister vortices’ that may travel outside of their typical range. The split higher up in the atmosphere could eventually cause a similar phenomenon to ‘drip’ down to the troposphere – the layer of the atmosphere closest to the surface, where most of our weather takes place. A split in the polar vortex can give rise to both sudden and delayed effects, much of which involves declining temperatures and extreme winter weather in the Eastern US along with Northern and Western Europe.

President Donald Trump used the occasion to again voice skepticism about climate change, tweeting: 'What the hell is going on with Global Waming? (sic) Please come back fast, we need you!'

But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates NWS, tweeted: 'Winter storms don't prove that global warming isn't happening.'

The NOAA also linked to a 2015 explanatory article in their tweet.

In New York City, forecasters are expecting temperatures to drop to near 5 degrees on Thursday morning. The wind chill then will be between -10 and -20.

The MTA says they will more than likely activate warming devices throughout their system to keep switches warm on all Long Island Rail Road and Metro North Railroad lines.

LIRR stations will also keep waiting rooms open 24 hours a day Wednesday through Saturday, according to CBS.

In New Jersey, Gov Phil Murphy is warning residents to plan for icy roads and potential blackouts.

Forecasters in western New York are warning of blizzard-like conditions over the next few days with up to two feet of snow, plummeting temperatures and wind chills that can cause frostbite in minutes.

In advance of the Great Lakes-fed storm, authorities closed schools in Buffalo and surrounding districts for Wednesday and Thursday and the state announced a ban on tractor-trailers and buses from the New York State Thruway.

The ban between Rochester and the Pennsylvania border took effect at 8pm Tuesday.

Drifting bands of lake-effect snow are expected to drop one to two feet by the storm's end. The hard-to-predict bands can bury some areas, even as the sun shines a short distance away."

NEW YORK CITY – As the entertainment world voices its support for Empire actor Jussie Smollett, police in Chicago are appealing to the public for any information about or witnesses to an alleged hate crime carried out against him.

The actor was attacked in the early hours of Tuesday morning by two men who used racist and homophobic slurs against him.

Authorities say Smollett needed hospital treatment after two men punched him in the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him when he was leaving a restaurant in Chicago.

One of the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck before both fled the scene. Police said they are treating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Smollett has since been discharged from the hospital.

Friends like John Legend and Viola Davis voiced their outrage at the attack on Smollett, who plays a gay character in Empire and is also openly gay himself."

In an emotional video to Instagram, Daniels called Smollett his “son”, before calling for change.

He said: “It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.”

As well as his acting, Smollett is also a singer and activist who has advocated HIV/Aids prevention."

The 35-year-old actor, who is black and came out as gay in 2015, was approached by two men in downtown Chicago at about 2am on Tuesday, police said.

He was struck in the face before having an “unknown chemical substance” poured over him and a rope wrapped around his neck, according to investigators.

Police also confirmed Smollett told them his attackers made reference to MAGA – Make America Great Again – which was Donald Trump’s slogan during the 2016 US presidential campaign.

Smollett has starred on Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul.

Smollett took himself to Chicago’s Northwestern Hospital and “is in good condition”, police said.

Following the attack, Ariana Grande was among the celebrities to offer support.

Grande said the incident left her “sick to my stomach” and sent, “all of the healing energy / love i possibly can and hoping for change”.

Grande added: “What can we do ? tell me & i’m there.”

Actress Olivia Munn wrote on Twitter the attack was, “why we have to have zero tolerance against homophobia and racism. Jussie’s life matters”.

Smollett, who stars in the musical drama series “Empire” and is openly black and gay, was walking in the street on his way home at 2 a.m. when he heard men yelling slurs at him, reported TMZ yesterday.

A police report stated that the actor was struck by the white men in ski masks and beat him up as he fought back. A chemical substance, said to be bleach, was poured on him. A noose was wrapped around his neck before the perpetrators left.

Smollett managed to bring himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital and was reportedly in “good condition.” He told the Chicago police department that he heard his attackers yell, “MAGA country.”

Eight days before the attack, a letter addressed to the actor was sent to Fox Studios in Chicago with the message, “You will die black f*g.” “MAGA” (Make America Great Again)” was written on the envelope, which contained white powder.

Chicago PD said in a statement that it wa3rps treating the attack as a “possible hate crime.”

According to reports, the two men who were identified as white were wearing ski masks, and they assaulted the film star by putting his head in a noose and screamed,

“This is MAGA country.”

The assailants then went on to reportedly beat Smollet, poured bleach on him, put a rope around his neck and left him with a fractured rib. The actor had to take himself to the hospital, Northwestern Memorial and was later discharged that morning.

It is learnt that the incident happened when Smollet was on his way to get food when someone yelled,

“Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****?”

Celebrity gossip site, ThatGrapeJuice.Net posted a letter that was sent to Fox Studios in Chicago with cut out letters spelling,

“You will die black f**.”

The envelope the letter arrived in appears to say MAGA in the upper left corner.

It is gathered that the letter was sent eight days ago and the FBI was already investigating the letter containing racist and homophobic slurs before the attack happened.

Currently, the case is being investigated by the police as battery and a possible hate crime. Chicago PD also confirms Smollet still had the rope around his neck when he made contact with them.

According to the celebrity gossip site, TMZ, the police recently visited a Target Department Store close to where the incident happened and obtained surveillance footage. The video reportedly shows one person presumably Smollett walking down the street. Officers also visited a nearby apartment building to ask for video.

“Empire” creator, Lee Daniels who expressed his outrage and horror over the attack briefly posted, but then deleted, a screen grab from a FaceTime he had with Smollett while he was in the hospital.

Fox also issued this statement below,

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stand united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Smollett’s character in “Empire” is also that of a gay singer who is the son of a music couple."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Directly contradicting President Donald Trump, U.S. intelligence agencies told Congress on Tuesday that North Korea is unlikely to dismantle its nuclear arsenal, that the Islamic State group remains a threat and that the Iran nuclear deal is working. The chiefs made no mention of a crisis at the U.S.-Mexican border for which Trump has considered declaring a national emergency.

Their analysis stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s almost singular focus on security gaps at the border as the biggest threat facing the United States.

Top security officials including FBI Director Christopher Wray, CIA Director Gina Haspel and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats presented an update to the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday on their annual assessment of global threats. They warned of an increasingly diverse range of security dangers around the globe, from North Korean nuclear weapons to Chinese cyberespionage to Russian campaigns to undermine Western democracies.

Coats said intelligence information does not support the idea that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will eliminate his nuclear weapons and the capacity for building more — a notion that is the basis of the U.S. negotiating strategy.

“We currently assess that North Korea will seek to retain its WMD (weapons of mass destruction) capabilities and is unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capability because its leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival,” Coats told the committee.

Trump friend Roger Stone pleads not guilty in Russia probe

WASHINGTON (AP) — Roger Stone, a longtime adviser and confidant of President Donald Trump, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to felony charges in the Russia investigation after a publicity-filled few days spent slamming the probe as politically motivated.

The political operative and self-described dirty trickster faces charges that he lied to lawmakers, engaged in witness tampering and obstructed a congressional investigation into possible co-ordination between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.

He was uncharacteristically quiet during Tuesday’s brief court appearance, rising to his feet to say, “Yes, Your Honor,” as U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson asked if he would agree to the conditions of his release, including restricted travel.

Stone attorney Robert Buschel entered the plea on his client’s behalf.

The voluble Stone, 66, held no press conference as he arrived and departed the courthouse amid dueling chants of “Lock Him Up” and “We Love Roger.” He waved and smiled to the small crowd, some holding up glowing photos of him, and he largely ignored a group of protesters carrying signs reading “Dirty traitor.” The Beatles’ “Back in the U.S.S.R.” blared from speakers outside the courthouse.

Midwest cities scramble to keep homeless from dangerous cold

BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Winter’s sharpest bite in years moved past painful into life-threatening territory Tuesday, prompting officials throughout the Midwest to take extraordinary measures to protect the homeless and other vulnerable people from the bitter cold, including turning some city buses into mobile warming shelters in Chicago.

Temperatures plunged as low as minus 26 (negative 32 degrees Celsius) in North Dakota with wind chills as low as minus 62 (negative 52 degrees Celsius) in Minnesota. It was nearly that cold in Wisconsin and Illinois. Governors in Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan declared emergencies as the worst of the cold threatened on Wednesday.

The U.S. Postal Service said it will not deliver mail in parts of the Midwest Wednesday because of the cold.

The bitter cold is the result of a split in the polar vortex that allowed temperatures to plunge much further south in North America than normal.

The National Weather Service forecast for Wednesday night called for temperatures in Chicago as low as minus 28 (negative 33 degrees Celsius), with wind chills to minus 50 (negative 46 degrees Celsius). Detroit’s outlook was for Wednesday overnight lows around minus 15 (negative 26 degrees Celsius), with wind chills dropping to minus 40 (negative 40 degrees Celsius).

China-US row over tech giant Huawei overshadows trade talks

BEIJING (AP) — U.S. criminal charges against Chinese electronics giant Huawei have sparked a fresh round of trans-Pacific recriminations, with Beijing demanding Tuesday that Washington back off what it called an “unreasonable crackdown” on the maker of smartphones and telecom gear.

China’s foreign ministry said it would defend the “lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies” but gave no details. Huawei is the No. 2 smartphone maker and an essential player in global communications networks.

A day earlier, U.S. prosecutors criminally charged Huawei and several of its officials for allegedly stealing technology secrets and violating Iran sanctions. That followed the detention in Canada of the Huawei founder’s daughter — a top company official who was named in one of the U.S. indictments, and who is now awaiting possible extradition to the U.S. Huawei has denied wrongdoing.

All that has further complicated U.S.-China relations amid attempts to defuse a trade war instigated by President Donald Trump and clashes over alleged Chinese theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property from U.S. firms. A new round of trade talks are planned for Wednesday in Washington.

The nearly two dozen charges unsealed Monday by the Justice Department accuse Huawei of trying to spirit a robot arm and other technology out of a T-Mobile smartphone testing lab. They also allege that Huawei, two subsidiaries and a top executive misled banks about the company’s business and violating U.S. sanctions.

US launches plan for asylum seekers to wait in Mexico

SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Trump administration on Tuesday quietly launched an effort to make asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their cases wind through U.S. immigration courts, despite clear reservations and conflicting messages from the Mexican government.

The U.S. returned one asylum seeker to Mexico — a Honduran man — on the first day of what would be one of the most dramatic changes to the U.S. immigration system of Donald Trump’s presidency, if the policy survives an anticipated legal challenge. Carlos Gomez, 55, arrived in Tijuana around midday and asked authorities for a ride to a migrant shelter.

Mexican officials sent mixed signals on the crucial point of whether Mexico would impose limits on accepting families. Tonatiuh Guillen, commissioner of Mexico’s National Immigration Institute, said Mexico would only accept people 18 to 60 years old, which rules out families with young children.

But Roberto Velasco, spokesman for Mexico’s foreign relations secretary, said Friday that families would be considered case by case. And a Mexican official with direct knowledge of the process said Mexico requested that families be excluded from the policy but that the U.S. declined to make any commitment, conceding only to start with single adults. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations were not public.

The launch is limited to San Diego’s San Ysidro border crossing, the nation’s busiest, though Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan wrote in a memo released Tuesday that it is expected to expand to other crossings “in the near future.” Adding to a sense of confusion, Guillen said Mexico will only allow it at the one crossing that connects San Diego and Tijuana.

FBI finds no specific motive in Vegas attack that killed 58

LAS VEGAS (AP) — The high-stakes gambler responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history sought notoriety in the attack but left his specific motive a mystery, the FBI said Tuesday as it concluded the investigation of the 2017 massacre that killed 58 country music fans.

While the agency found no “single or clear motivating factor” to explain why Stephen Paddock opened fire from his suite in a high-rise casino hotel, Paddock may have been seeking to follow in his father’s criminal footsteps, the FBI said.

“It wasn’t about MGM, Mandalay Bay or a specific casino or venue,” Aaron Rouse, the agent in charge of the FBI’s Las Vegas office, told The Associated Press. “It was all about doing the maximum amount of damage and him obtaining some form of infamy.”

Paddock’s physical and mental health was declining. The 64-year-old’s wealth had diminished, and he struggled with aging, federal agents said. The findings were contained in a long-awaited report compiled by the FBI’s Behavior Analysis Unit, a group of experts who spent months examining several factors that might have led to the rampage.

“This report comes as close to understanding the why as we’re ever going to get,” Rouse said.

Venezuela opposition urges walkouts to pressure Maduro

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Opposition leader Juan Guaido is looking to ratchet up pressure on President Nicolas Maduro with walkouts across Venezuela on Wednesday, just a day after the embattled socialist administration barred Guaido from leaving the country while he is investigated for anti-government activities.

The man challenging Maduro’s claim to the presidency is urging Venezuelans to step outside their homes and workplaces for two hours beginning at noon in the first mass mobilization since he declared himself the nation’s rightful leader a week ago during another round of big protests.

“Venezuela is set on change,” Guaido said.

The surge in political manoeuvring has seen two dozen nations, including the United States and several big Latin American countries, backed Guaido, and the Trump administration has imposed sanctions that could starve the already distressed nation of billions in oil revenue.

But Maduro is holding firm in refusing to step down. He oversaw military exercises in recent days while seeking to consolidate support from the armed forces and he is accusing Washington of staging a coup.

After bankruptcy, PG&E headed back to court over wildfires

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Pacific Gas & Electric Co. will be back in a U.S. courtroom a day after declaring bankruptcy, as it tries to convince a judge not to order dramatic steps to try to prevent its equipment from causing more wildfires.

U.S. Judge William Alsup is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday on his proposal earlier this month that the nation’s largest utility remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines in high-wind conditions and shut off power at certain times regardless of the inconvenience to customers or loss of profit.

Alsup is overseeing a criminal conviction against PG&E on pipeline safety charges stemming from a deadly gas line explosion in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2010. The measures the judge has proposed would be part of the utility’s probation.

Alsup said his goal was to prevent PG&E equipment from causing any wildfires during the 2019 fire season. PG&E shot back in a court filing last week that the judge’s proposals would endanger lives and could cost as much as $150 billion to implement. They would also interfere with the work of federal and state regulators, PG&E said.

Wildfire damage has become a multibillion-dollar liability for the utility. The company filed for bankruptcy Tuesday in the face of hundreds of lawsuits from victims of wildfires in 2017 and 2018, including the nation’s deadliest wildfire in a century.

Apple opens new chapter amid weakening iPhone demand

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple hoped to offset slowing demand for iPhones by raising the prices of its most important product, but that strategy seems to have backfired after sales sagged during the holiday shopping season.

Results released Tuesday revealed the magnitude of the iPhone slump — a 15 per cent drop in revenue from the previous year. That decline in Apple’s most profitable product caused Apple’s total earnings for the October-December quarter to dip slightly to $20 billion.

Now, CEO Tim Cook is grappling with his toughest challenge since replacing co-founder Steve Jobs 7 1/2 years ago. Even as he tries to boost iPhone sales, Cook also must prove that Apple can still thrive even if demand doesn’t rebound.

It figures to be an uphill battle, given Apple’s stock has lost one-third of its value in less than four months, erasing about $370 billion in shareholder wealth.

Cook rattled Wall Street in early January by disclosing the company had missed its own revenue projections for the first time in 15 years. The last time that happened, the iPod was just beginning to transform Apple.

‘Empire’ cast member alleges homophobic attack in Chicago

CHICAGO (AP) — A cast member on the hit television show “Empire” alleged he was physically attacked by men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs, police said Tuesday.

Police did not release the actor’s name but a statement from Fox, which airs “Empire,” identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime. Smollett is black and openly gay.

According to a police statement, the actor was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an “unknown substance” on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that when officers first came in contact with Smollett, he still had a rope around his neck. While being interviewed by detectives, Guglielmi said Smollett told them that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The police spokesman added that the two men were wearing masks. Investigators have not found any surveillance video or witnesses from which they can put together a description of the offenders, he said.

News of the early morning attack left the entertainment world reeling and gay advocacy groups speaking out in support of the 36-year-old actor.







Smollett was beaten at around 2 a.m. by two attackers who yelled “racial and homophobic slurs” while he walked downtown in the third-biggest US city, said police, who did not name him but said the victim was an actor from “Empire.”

Smollett’s fellow cast members and production company identified him as the victim.

The attackers poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him, and then wrapped a rope around the actor’s neck, according to police.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” the Chicago Police Department said.

The actor and singer was reportedly in Chicago for a scheduled Saturday concert.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, who on the weekend launched her 2020 campaign to be America’s first black female president, called the incident “an attempted modern day lynching.”

“No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate,” Harris said on Twitter.

Members of the “Empire” production team and cast, as well as the studio that produces the program, also spoke out.

“The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own,” 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.

The show’s co-creator Lee Daniels posted an Instagram video calling Jussie “my son.”

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” Daniels said, addressing the actor.

“Hold your head up Jussie. I’m with you. I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another fucking day in America,” he said.

Advocacy groups including the The Trevor Project and the American Civil Liberties Union, quickly offered their support as well.

“LGBTQ people of color live at multiple intersections of oppression, too often facing violence compounded by both racism and homophobia,” the ACLU said.

The U.S. returned one asylum seeker to Mexico — a Honduran man — on the first day of what would be one of the most dramatic changes to the U.S. immigration system of Donald Trump’s presidency, if the policy survives an anticipated legal challenge. Carlos Gomez, 55, arrived in Tijuana around midday and asked authorities for a ride to a migrant shelter.

Mexican officials sent mixed signals on the crucial point of whether Mexico would impose limits on accepting families. Tonatiuh Guillen, commissioner of Mexico’s National Immigration Institute, said Mexico would only accept people 18 to 60 years old, which rules out families with young children.

But Roberto Velasco, spokesman for Mexico’s foreign relations secretary, said Friday that families would be considered case by case. And a Mexican official with direct knowledge of the process said Mexico requested that families be excluded from the policy but that the U.S. declined to make any commitment, conceding only to start with single adults. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations were not public.

The launch is limited to San Diego’s San Ysidro border crossing, the nation’s busiest, though Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan wrote in a memo released Tuesday that it is expected to expand to other crossings “in the near future.” Adding to a sense of confusion, Guillen said Mexico will only allow it at the one crossing that connects San Diego and Tijuana.

FBI finds no specific motive in Vegas attack that killed 58

LAS VEGAS (AP) — The high-stakes gambler responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history sought notoriety in the attack but left his specific motive a mystery, the FBI said Tuesday as it concluded the investigation of the 2017 massacre that killed 58 country music fans.

While the agency found no “single or clear motivating factor” to explain why Stephen Paddock opened fire from his suite in a high-rise casino hotel, Paddock may have been seeking to follow in his father’s criminal footsteps, the FBI said.

“It wasn’t about MGM, Mandalay Bay or a specific casino or venue,” Aaron Rouse, the agent in charge of the FBI’s Las Vegas office, told The Associated Press. “It was all about doing the maximum amount of damage and him obtaining some form of infamy.”

Paddock’s physical and mental health was declining. The 64-year-old’s wealth had diminished, and he struggled with aging, federal agents said. The findings were contained in a long-awaited report compiled by the FBI’s Behavior Analysis Unit, a group of experts who spent months examining several factors that might have led to the rampage.

“This report comes as close to understanding the why as we’re ever going to get,” Rouse said.

Venezuela opposition urges walkouts to pressure Maduro

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Opposition leader Juan Guaido is looking to ratchet up pressure on President Nicolas Maduro with walkouts across Venezuela on Wednesday, just a day after the embattled socialist administration barred Guaido from leaving the country while he is investigated for anti-government activities.

The man challenging Maduro’s claim to the presidency is urging Venezuelans to step outside their homes and workplaces for two hours beginning at noon in the first mass mobilization since he declared himself the nation’s rightful leader a week ago during another round of big protests.

“Venezuela is set on change,” Guaido said.

The surge in political manoeuvring has seen two dozen nations, including the United States and several big Latin American countries, backed Guaido, and the Trump administration has imposed sanctions that could starve the already distressed nation of billions in oil revenue.

But Maduro is holding firm in refusing to step down. He oversaw military exercises in recent days while seeking to consolidate support from the armed forces and he is accusing Washington of staging a coup.

After bankruptcy, PG&E headed back to court over wildfires

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Pacific Gas & Electric Co. will be back in a U.S. courtroom a day after declaring bankruptcy, as it tries to convince a judge not to order dramatic steps to try to prevent its equipment from causing more wildfires.

U.S. Judge William Alsup is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday on his proposal earlier this month that the nation’s largest utility remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines in high-wind conditions and shut off power at certain times regardless of the inconvenience to customers or loss of profit.

Alsup is overseeing a criminal conviction against PG&E on pipeline safety charges stemming from a deadly gas line explosion in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2010. The measures the judge has proposed would be part of the utility’s probation.

Alsup said his goal was to prevent PG&E equipment from causing any wildfires during the 2019 fire season. PG&E shot back in a court filing last week that the judge’s proposals would endanger lives and could cost as much as $150 billion to implement. They would also interfere with the work of federal and state regulators, PG&E said.

Wildfire damage has become a multibillion-dollar liability for the utility. The company filed for bankruptcy Tuesday in the face of hundreds of lawsuits from victims of wildfires in 2017 and 2018, including the nation’s deadliest wildfire in a century.

Apple opens new chapter amid weakening iPhone demand

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple hoped to offset slowing demand for iPhones by raising the prices of its most important product, but that strategy seems to have backfired after sales sagged during the holiday shopping season.

Results released Tuesday revealed the magnitude of the iPhone slump — a 15 per cent drop in revenue from the previous year. That decline in Apple’s most profitable product caused Apple’s total earnings for the October-December quarter to dip slightly to $20 billion.

Now, CEO Tim Cook is grappling with his toughest challenge since replacing co-founder Steve Jobs 7 1/2 years ago. Even as he tries to boost iPhone sales, Cook also must prove that Apple can still thrive even if demand doesn’t rebound.

It figures to be an uphill battle, given Apple’s stock has lost one-third of its value in less than four months, erasing about $370 billion in shareholder wealth.

Cook rattled Wall Street in early January by disclosing the company had missed its own revenue projections for the first time in 15 years. The last time that happened, the iPod was just beginning to transform Apple.

‘Empire’ cast member alleges homophobic attack in Chicago

CHICAGO (AP) — A cast member on the hit television show “Empire” alleged he was physically attacked by men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs, police said Tuesday.

Police did not release the actor’s name but a statement from Fox, which airs “Empire,” identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime. Smollett is black and openly gay.

According to a police statement, the actor was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an “unknown substance” on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that when officers first came in contact with Smollett, he still had a rope around his neck. While being interviewed by detectives, Guglielmi said Smollett told them that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The police spokesman added that the two men were wearing masks. Investigators have not found any surveillance video or witnesses from which they can put together a description of the offenders, he said.

Jussie Smollett, the star of Empire, was reportedly beaten and left with rope around his neck in a racist, homophobic hate attack in Chicago overnight.

Smollett was set upon by two men in ski masks who abused him with slurs including “n***er” and “faggot”, and who then allegedly poured bleach over him and wrapped rope around his neck, initially reported by TMZ.

The actor was able to take himself to hospital, where he was described as being in “good condition”.

Chicago Police initially denied reports that the assailants used the phrase “MAGA country” but Smollett later confirmed that they had made these comments during the attack.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said.

US Senator Cory Booker described the assault as “an attempted modern-day lynching”.

The FBI is also now assisting with the investigation into the attack following reports that threatening hate mail had been sent to a Fox studio in Chicago addressed to Smollett.

The envelope containing the message, which was spelled out in cut-out magazine letters, was received last week and contained a powdery substance investigators believe to have been over-the-counter pain relief medication Tylenol.

Just three days ago, Smollett tweeted that “frauds are everywhere” and to remember that “salt, cocaine and anthrax can all appear to be sugar…just be careful out here fam. Happy Sunday. Love you. Real talk. Love on.”

Smollett, who came out on The Ellen Show in 2015, received an outpouring of support on social media.

Laverne Cox tweeted, “Your spirit is strong. Your resilience is hardwired. My brother you are fortified in healing energy from most high that is already seeing you through.”

Poet Jericho Brown said, “Of course, I wish we had a better understanding of how often things like this are happening to people who ain’t as famous. Good to be reminded our celebrity won’t save us.”

“He better be okay,” tweeted Moonlight writer Tarell Alvin McCraney. “We never safe.”

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserve, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you,” said Empire‘s co-creator and producer Lee Daniels in a video shared on social media.

Smollett’s character on Empire is also gay.

“You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that,” Daniels said."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Directly contradicting President Donald Trump, U.S. intelligence agencies told Congress on Tuesday that North Korea is unlikely to dismantle its nuclear arsenal, that the Islamic State group remains a threat and that the Iran nuclear deal is working. The chiefs made no mention of a crisis at the U.S.-Mexican border for which Trump has considered declaring a national emergency.

Their analysis stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s almost singular focus on security gaps at the border as the biggest threat facing the United States.

Top security officials including FBI Director Christopher Wray, CIA Director Gina Haspel and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats presented an update to the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday on their annual assessment of global threats. They warned of an increasingly diverse range of security dangers around the globe, from North Korean nuclear weapons to Chinese cyberespionage to Russian campaigns to undermine Western democracies.

Coats said intelligence information does not support the idea that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will eliminate his nuclear weapons and the capacity for building more — a notion that is the basis of the U.S. negotiating strategy.

“We currently assess that North Korea will seek to retain its WMD (weapons of mass destruction) capabilities and is unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capability because its leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival,” Coats told the committee.

Trump friend Roger Stone pleads not guilty in Russia probe

WASHINGTON (AP) — Roger Stone, a longtime adviser and confidant of President Donald Trump, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to felony charges in the Russia investigation after a publicity-filled few days spent slamming the probe as politically motivated.

The political operative and self-described dirty trickster faces charges that he lied to lawmakers, engaged in witness tampering and obstructed a congressional investigation into possible co-ordination between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.

He was uncharacteristically quiet during Tuesday’s brief court appearance, rising to his feet to say, “Yes, Your Honor,” as U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson asked if he would agree to the conditions of his release, including restricted travel.

Stone attorney Robert Buschel entered the plea on his client’s behalf.

The voluble Stone, 66, held no press conference as he arrived and departed the courthouse amid dueling chants of “Lock Him Up” and “We Love Roger.” He waved and smiled to the small crowd, some holding up glowing photos of him, and he largely ignored a group of protesters carrying signs reading “Dirty traitor.” The Beatles’ “Back in the U.S.S.R.” blared from speakers outside the courthouse.

Midwest cities scramble to keep homeless from dangerous cold

BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Winter’s sharpest bite in years moved past painful into life-threatening territory Tuesday, prompting officials throughout the Midwest to take extraordinary measures to protect the homeless and other vulnerable people from the bitter cold, including turning some city buses into mobile warming shelters in Chicago.

Temperatures plunged as low as minus 26 (negative 32 degrees Celsius) in North Dakota with wind chills as low as minus 62 (negative 52 degrees Celsius) in Minnesota. It was nearly that cold in Wisconsin and Illinois. Governors in Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan declared emergencies as the worst of the cold threatened on Wednesday.

The U.S. Postal Service said it will not deliver mail in parts of the Midwest Wednesday because of the cold.

The bitter cold is the result of a split in the polar vortex that allowed temperatures to plunge much further south in North America than normal.

The National Weather Service forecast for Wednesday night called for temperatures in Chicago as low as minus 28 (negative 33 degrees Celsius), with wind chills to minus 50 (negative 46 degrees Celsius). Detroit’s outlook was for Wednesday overnight lows around minus 15 (negative 26 degrees Celsius), with wind chills dropping to minus 40 (negative 40 degrees Celsius).

China-US row over tech giant Huawei overshadows trade talks

BEIJING (AP) — U.S. criminal charges against Chinese electronics giant Huawei have sparked a fresh round of trans-Pacific recriminations, with Beijing demanding Tuesday that Washington back off what it called an “unreasonable crackdown” on the maker of smartphones and telecom gear.

China’s foreign ministry said it would defend the “lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies” but gave no details. Huawei is the No. 2 smartphone maker and an essential player in global communications networks.

A day earlier, U.S. prosecutors criminally charged Huawei and several of its officials for allegedly stealing technology secrets and violating Iran sanctions. That followed the detention in Canada of the Huawei founder’s daughter — a top company official who was named in one of the U.S. indictments, and who is now awaiting possible extradition to the U.S. Huawei has denied wrongdoing.

All that has further complicated U.S.-China relations amid attempts to defuse a trade war instigated by President Donald Trump and clashes over alleged Chinese theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property from U.S. firms. A new round of trade talks are planned for Wednesday in Washington.

The nearly two dozen charges unsealed Monday by the Justice Department accuse Huawei of trying to spirit a robot arm and other technology out of a T-Mobile smartphone testing lab. They also allege that Huawei, two subsidiaries and a top executive misled banks about the company’s business and violating U.S. sanctions.

Alsup is overseeing a criminal conviction against PG&E on pipeline safety charges stemming from a deadly gas line explosion in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2010. The measures the judge has proposed would be part of the utility’s probation.

Alsup said his goal was to prevent PG&E equipment from causing any wildfires during the 2019 fire season. PG&E shot back in a court filing last week that the judge’s proposals would endanger lives and could cost as much as $150 billion to implement. They would also interfere with the work of federal and state regulators, PG&E said.

Wildfire damage has become a multibillion-dollar liability for the utility. The company filed for bankruptcy Tuesday in the face of hundreds of lawsuits from victims of wildfires in 2017 and 2018, including the nation’s deadliest wildfire in a century.

Apple opens new chapter amid weakening iPhone demand

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple hoped to offset slowing demand for iPhones by raising the prices of its most important product, but that strategy seems to have backfired after sales sagged during the holiday shopping season.

Results released Tuesday revealed the magnitude of the iPhone slump — a 15 per cent drop in revenue from the previous year. That decline in Apple’s most profitable product caused Apple’s total earnings for the October-December quarter to dip slightly to $20 billion.

Now, CEO Tim Cook is grappling with his toughest challenge since replacing co-founder Steve Jobs 7 1/2 years ago. Even as he tries to boost iPhone sales, Cook also must prove that Apple can still thrive even if demand doesn’t rebound.

It figures to be an uphill battle, given Apple’s stock has lost one-third of its value in less than four months, erasing about $370 billion in shareholder wealth.

Cook rattled Wall Street in early January by disclosing the company had missed its own revenue projections for the first time in 15 years. The last time that happened, the iPod was just beginning to transform Apple.

‘Empire’ cast member alleges homophobic attack in Chicago

CHICAGO (AP) — A cast member on the hit television show “Empire” alleged he was physically attacked by men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs, police said Tuesday.

Police did not release the actor’s name but a statement from Fox, which airs “Empire,” identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime. Smollett is black and openly gay.

According to a police statement, the actor was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an “unknown substance” on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that when officers first came in contact with Smollett, he still had a rope around his neck. While being interviewed by detectives, Guglielmi said Smollett told them that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The police spokesman added that the two men were wearing masks. Investigators have not found any surveillance video or witnesses from which they can put together a description of the offenders, he said.

Douglas Golden']",,"['hate', 'reported', 'chicago', 'alleged', 'smollett', 'maga', 'manurespreaders', 'attackers', 'sensationalism', 'empire', 'white', 'media', 'incident']","Here we go again. If you think the manure-spreaders of sensationalism who masquerade as ethical practitioners of journalism learned anything from last week's MAGA-bashing Covington Catholic High School hoax, I have three words for you:

Ha, ha, ha.

On Tuesday morning, uncorroborated claims by actor Jussie Smollett that he was the victim of a ""brutal"" hate crime by Trump supporters in Chicago went viral across social media. Entertainment rag TMZ.com first splashed ""exclusive"" headlines that the ""Empire"" cast member was ""beaten by MAGA backers"" in a ""homophobic attack"" at around 2 a.m. in Chicago. If you have no idea what ""Empire"" is or who Smollett is, join the club. The TV star is apparently a vocal critic of Trump and attacked ""45 and all his white hooded cohorts"" on Instagram last week.

But I digress.

Within minutes, the gossip site's squib on the TV star's alleged victimization trended on Twitter and rocketed up to USA Today, Variety, CBS, CNN and the New York Times. The Fishwrap of Record breathlessly reported lurid details of two people who ""wrapped rope around his neck,"" which multiple outlets characterized as a ""noose."" A police statement providing incident background stated that ""the offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,"" according to Smollett. Multiple websites reported that the substance was bleach.

TRENDING: Same DA charging cop who shot Rayshard Brooks is under investigation himself

This is truly horrible, if true. But color me cautious and skeptical. TMZ initially reported that Smollett had exited a Subway chain restaurant near his luxury apartment when accosted by the racist, homophobic assailants, who allegedly recognized him from his work on ""Empire."" Allegedly, Smollett received a hate mail with the word ""MAGA"" on it addressed to him and sent to his studio in Chicago last week. If this was a premeditated attack, the FBI should get to the bottom of it.

But oddities and discrepancies abound:

TMZ quoted one of the ""MAGA country"" attackers who allegedly hurled epithets at Smollett: ""Aren't you that f––t 'Empire' n––-?""

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces wander around the upscale Streeterville neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about ""MAGA country""?

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces have ever heard of ""Empire,"" could recognize Jussie Smollett, or know or care anything about his sexuality?

Despite TMZ's claim that Smollett had the ""hell beat outta him"" and attackers ""broke his ribs"" plus subjected him to a chemical attack, an ambulance was not called and he instead ""self-transported"" to the hospital. CWB Chicago, a local public safety watchdog site, reported on police dispatch records documenting that Smollett's friend ""Frank"" refused EMS services for Smollett; no mention of bleach was made; ""no or minor injury"" was observed; and ""officers never sent a flash; message with offender descriptions to field units.""

Weird.

Another assertion not included in the CPD's initial press release on the incident: Any mention of ""MAGA supporters"" or any mention of the race of the alleged assailants. Police clarified that they had not received any official information backing TMZ reporter Charles Latibeaudiere's claim, which he attributed to sources close to Smollett, that the alleged attackers shouted, ""This is MAGA country.""

Nor had the police corroborated that the attackers were white, since Smollett had told them their faces and hands were both covered. After launching a search for surveillance video and potential witnesses, the police department reported late Tuesday that ""thus far we have not found anything to be able to put out a description.""

I was told that public records requests for the incident report may take ""weeks"" to be approved. I was also told the Chicago police remain in charge of investigating the alleged incident, while the FBI probe of the alleged hate mail remains separate.

CPD's public information office also told me late Tuesday that when police responded to the 911 call regarding the incident, Smollett gave them no details about where it occurred or what the attackers looked like. None. They were reportedly on scene for an hour with Smollett. When I asked again how the claims about white ""MAGA attackers"" were disseminated in the press, the PIO replied:

""We have no idea where that came from.""

Minutes after I hung up the phone with her, a local Chicago reporter tweeted that Smollett did mention the ""MAGA"" angle in a ""follow-up, supplemental interview."" Which is it?

Despite all the holes, contradictions and unanswered questions, the MAGA hate crime narrative has already calcified. (Sound familiar?) By 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, a search for ""MAGA"" and ""Smollett"" on Google yielded 3,520,000 results. And TMZ ended its day of social justice pot-stirring with the Rev. Al Sharpton calling for President Donald Trump to ""denounce Jussie Smollett's MAGA attackers"" who have yet to be identified.

Classic manufactured ""news"": Report on an uncorroborated hate crime. Plant unverified details. Repeatedly blame white male Trump supporters. Stoke Hollywood outrage. Enlist the godfather of hate crime hoaxes to call on the president to denounce phantom attackers. Reap clicks and publicity. Indict all skeptics as racists and haters. Repeat.

Smears first. Facts later. How much deader can American journalism get?"

Several actors, producers, and even lawmakers shared their reactions, condemning the ""racist and homophobic"" attack.

The Chicago Police Department said in a statement that Smollett, who is black and gay, was walking in the downtown Chicago neighborhood of Streeterville in the 300 block of E. North Water Street around 2 a.m. EST ""when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him.""

According to TMZ, Smollett had gone out for food after landing in the city for an event when the assault occurred. The celebrity news website also said the attackers screamed, ""This is MAGA country."" The police department also confirmed to TMZ that Smollett told them, in a follow-up interview, about the attackers yelling, ""MAGA country.""

The police said in the statement ""the offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim."" Smollett was later hospitalized for the injuries and is now in “good condition.”

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said officials “continue to seek any available evidence/video to identify possible offenders in [the Jussie Smollett] case.” He also urged people to come forward with any information that could help in the case. “Thus far we have not found anything to be able put out a (suspect) description,” Guglielmi tweeted.

Guglielmi told CNN that investigators searched for video evidence in the neighborhood where the reported attack occurred but still did not found any clues. The only image of Smollett police obtained from security cameras was from inside a Subway Sandwich shop, where the actor was standing alone.

The 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment issued a statement: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our ‘Empire’ family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night... We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

The horrific attack was also condemned by LGBT non-profit GLAAD: “GLAAD reached out to Fox and Jussie’s team today to offer assistance as well as support for him. Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

Not only the entertainment world, but lawmakers also reacted to the incident, calling for stricter laws.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) condemned the violent attack, calling it “an attempted modern day lynching.”

“[Smollett] is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery,” the 2020 presidential candidate tweeted. “This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) echoed Harris's comments, tweeting: ""The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.""

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) also tweeted: “This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it's the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color... We are all responsible for condemning this behavior and every person who enables or normalizes it.”"

Chicago: Black, openly-gay actor Jussie Smollett of the US television program “Empire” was hospitalized Tuesday in Chicago following a possibly hate-motivated attack in which assailants tied a rope around his neck, police and his co-workers said.

News of the early morning attack left the entertainment world reeling and gay advocacy groups speaking out in support of the 36-year-old actor. Smollett was beaten at around 2:00 am by two attackers who yelled “racial and homophobic slurs” while he walked downtown in the third-biggest US city, said police, who did not name him but said the victim was an actor from “Empire.”

Smollett’s fellow cast members and production company identified him as the victim.

The attackers poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him, and then wrapped a rope around the actor’s neck, according to police.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” the Chicago Police Department said. The actor and singer was reportedly in Chicago for a scheduled Saturday concert.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, who on the weekend launched her 2020 campaign to be America’s first black female president, called the incident “an attempted modern day lynching.” “No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate,” Harris said on Twitter.

Members of the “Empire” production team and cast, as well as the studio that produces the program, also spoke out. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own,” 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.

The show’s co-creator Lee Daniels posted an Instagram video calling Jussie “my son.” “You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” Daniels said, addressing the actor. “Hold your head up Jussie. I’m with you. I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another fucking day in America,” he said.

Advocacy groups including the The Trevor Project and the American Civil Liberties Union, quickly offered their support as well. “LGBTQ people of color live at multiple intersections of oppression, too often facing violence compounded by both racism and homophobia,” the ACLU said.

“This isn’t the America we want to live in.”"

Smollett was able to take himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was last reported in good condition.

Guglielmi also said the FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago last week.

The hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Jamal Lyon, Smollett's character, is the gay, middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Tuesday in support of Smollett. ""The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence,"" the statement read.

""Empire"" co-creator Lee Daniels also voiced his support for Smollett in an Instagram video.

""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,"" Daniels said. ""You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.""

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

""He is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I've ever met,"" Harris said Tuesday, adding that she's still learning more details about the incident.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues and he released his debut album, ""Sum of My Music,"" last year.

""Empire"" is shot in Chicago and a Fox spokeswoman said the program is currently in production.

The actor was jumped early Tuesday morning by two men in ski masks who tied a rope around his neck and threw bleach on his face while shouting racist and homophobic slurs at him. After the men got away, Smollett transported himself to the hospital where he was treated for minor injuries and later discharged.

According to Entertainment Tonight, the series held an ""emotional"" production meeting Tuesday morning to inform the cast and crew of what had happened to the actor.

Production on the series was not suspended after the incident, and the report revealed the situation is ""fluid"" regarding when the actor will continue filming. Fox reportedly stepped up security for members of production after they received a threatening letter.

As first reported by ThatGrapeJuice.net, the attack on the actor might have been premeditated, posting a photo of a note he received prior to the incident from her home that read: ""You Will Die Black F—,"" in cut-out magazine letters, next to a stick figure drawing of someone getting lynched.

A source revealed to the outlet that Smollett is physically O.K. but the attack left him ""shaken.""

""Jussie was walking when two guys started yelling racial and homophobic slurs at the Empire star,"" the source said. ""Jussie was then attacked by the men and was repeatedly hit. Jussie tried to protect himself and at one point the men poured a substance on him believed to be bleach and one of the guys put a rope around his neck. After some time the men fled the scene and Jussie went to the hospital. Jussie is mostly physically O.K. with some scrapes and bruises, but he’s more emotionally shook up.""

Chicago police have been investigating the incident, searching for video of the attack in an attempt to identify the perpetrators. Reports also say the FBI might be taking over the investigation after the realization the attack may have been premeditated.

Since news of the attack broke, many public figures and celebrities have spoken on the matter, sending messages of support to the actor.

""What happened to Jussie has me feeling so upset,"" Dancing With the Stars personality Adam Rippon tweeted. ""I dont want to believe that we still live in a world where attacks like this can happen. Jussie, I don’t know you, but I love you. The men that attacked him are disgusting. They are monsters.""

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack as of press time."

There’s breaking the internet and then there’s backing up all lines of textual conversation.

Well, Ashton Kutcher just made all our teenage dreams come true by tweeting out his personal phone number and uttering four simple words, ‘You can text me’.

The Just Married hunk was clearly inundated by messages because he swiftly deleted the post and tweeted: ‘I will repost soon… sms is a fragile beast.’ Why tease us this way?

Ashton tweeted his digits on Tuesday night claiming her ‘missed having a real connection with real people.’ He misses his ‘community’ with a capital ‘C’.

He said: ‘From now on you can just text me. I won’t be able to respond to everyone but at least we can be real w/ each other & I can share the unedited latest & greatest in my world.’

Asking for trouble, Ashton published the all-important cell number and added: ‘Yes this is my [number].’

Many Twitter users reported getting a reply straight away, albeit, automated.

The response said: ‘Hey it’s Ashton. This is an auto text to let you know I got your message, everything else will be from me.

‘Make sure you click on the link and add yourself to my phone so I can respond to you.’

Oh Ashton, so quick on the reply (Twitter)

Too good to be true, right? Actually yes, according to Wired magazine, who did a little digging into Ashton’s motivations.

The publication claims the link in the automated reply takes you to a portal for start-up Community.com (hence the capital ‘C’) where you’re asked to sign up using your name, birthday and city.

The website, they claim, aims to ‘provide clients (including influencers, musicians, athletes, brands, actors and their agents) to send and receive text messages from users… using a ten-digit Community Phone Number.’

Here we go again. If you think the manure-spreaders of sensationalism who masquerade as ethical practitioners of journalism learned anything from last week’s MAGA-bashing Covington Catholic High School hoax, I have three words for you:

Ha, ha, ha.

On Tuesday morning, uncorroborated claims by actor Jussie Smollett that he was the victim of a “brutal” hate crime by Trump supporters in Chicago went viral across social media. Entertainment rag TMZ.com first splashed “exclusive” headlines that the “Empire” cast member was “beaten by MAGA backers” in a “homophobic attack” at around 2a.m. in Chicago. If you have no idea what “Empire” is or who Smollett is, join the club. The TV star is apparently a vocal critic of Trump and attacked “45 and all his white hooded cohorts” on Instagram last week.

But I digress.

Within minutes, the gossip site’s squib on the TV star’s alleged victimization trended on Twitter and rocketed up to USA Today, Variety, CBS, CNN, and the New York Times. The Fishwrap of Record breathlessly reported lurid details of two people who “wrapped rope around his neck,” which multiple outlets characterized as a “noose.” A police statement providing incident background stated that “the offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” according to Smollett. Multiple websites reported that the substance was bleach.

This is truly horrible, if true. But color me cautious and skeptical. TMZ initially reported that Smollett had exited a Subway chain restaurant near his luxury apartment when accosted by the racist, homophobic assailants, who allegedly recognized him from his work on “Empire.” Allegedly, Smollett received a hate mail with the word “MAGA” on it addressed to him and sent to his studio in Chicago last week. If this was a premeditated “attack,” the FBI should get to the bottom of it.

But oddities and discrepancies abound:

TMZ quoted one of the “MAGA country” attackers who allegedly hurled epithets at Smollett: “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****?”

Question: How many racist, homophobic menaces wander around the upscale Streeterville neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about “MAGA country?”

Question: How many racist, homophobic menaces have ever heard of “Empire,” could recognize Jussie Smollett, or know or care anything about his sexuality?

Despite TMZ’s claim that Smollett had the “hell beat outta him” and attackers “broke his ribs” plus subjected him to a chemical attack, an ambulance was not called and he instead “self-transported” to the hospital. CWB Chicago, a local public safety watchdog site, reported on police dispatch records documenting that Smollett’s friend “Frank” refused EMS services for Smollett; no mention of bleach was made; “no or minor injury” was observed; and “officers never sent a ‘flash; message with offender descriptions to field units.”

30 minutes later (3:39 AM) Officers get a report # for an ""aggravated battery with hands, feet, or fists causing no or minor injury""#ChicagoScanner #Chicago #FromTheArchives — CWBChicago (@CWBChicago) January 29, 2019

Notable: Officers never sent a ""flash"" message with offender descriptions to field units. — CWBChicago (@CWBChicago) January 29, 2019

Weird.

Another assertion not included in the CPD’s initial press release on the incident: Any mention of “MAGA supporters” or any mention of the race of the alleged assailants. Police clarified that they had not received any official information backing TMZ reporter Charles Latibeaudiere’s claim, which he attributed to sources close to Smollett, that the alleged attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country.”

Nor had the police corroborated that the attackers were white, since Smollett had told them their faces and hands were both covered. After launching a search for surveillance video and potential witnesses, the police department reported late Tuesday that “thus far we have not found anything to be able to put out a description.”

I was told that public records requests for the incident report may take “weeks” to be approved. I was also told the Chicago police remain in charge of investigating the alleged incident, while the FBI probe of the alleged hate mail remains separate.

CPD’s public information office also told me late Tuesday that when police responded to the 911 call regarding the incident, Smollett gave them no details about where it occurred or what the attackers looked like. None. They were reportedly on scene for an hour with Smollett. When I asked again how the claims about white “MAGA attackers” were disseminated in the press, the PIO replied:

“We have no idea where that came from.”

Minutes after I hung up the phone with her, a local Chicago reporter tweeted that Smollett did mention the “MAGA” angle in a “follow-up, supplemental interview.” Which is it?

Despite all the holes, contradictions, and unanswered questions, the MAGA hate crime narrative has already calcified. (Sound familiar?) By 5pm Eastern on Tuesday, a search for “MAGA” and “Smollett” on Google yielded 3,520,000 results. And TMZ ended its day of social justice pot-stirring with the Rev. Al Sharpton calling for President Trump to “denounce Jussie Smollett’s MAGA attackers” who have yet to be identified.

Classic manufactured “news:” Report on an uncorroborated hate crime. Plant unverified details. Repeatedly blame white male Trump supporters. Stoke Hollywood outrage. Enlist the Godfather of Hate Crime Hoaxes to call on the president to denounce phantom attackers. Reap clicks and publicity. Indict all skeptics as racists and haters. Repeat.

Smears first. Facts later. How much deader can American journalism get?

***

Update 1/30/19 7:25pm Eastern. So after assigning a dozen CPD officers and unknown numbers of FBI agents to the case, law enforcement officials have scoured hundreds of hours of surveillance video. There is no video of any assault, but CPD is preparing to release grainy video of “potential persons of interest.” Which could mean random people walking on the streets or associates or acquaintances of Smollett. Or who knows who else.

Meantime, the MAGA-phobic media is already spreading more fake news:

UPDATE 1/31

So Smollett’s music manager claims he was on the phone with Smollett when he was allegedly attacked and heard the alleged “MAGA country” attack. But Smollett refuses to turn over his phone.

That’s not shady. Sarcasm off.

NEW: Chicago police CONFIRM Jussie Smollett and his music manager, Brandon Moore, told detectives they were on the phone when Smollett was being attacked. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

However, detectives are unable to ""independently verify"" the call occurred because Smollett refused to turn over his phone. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

ORDER IT NOW

More weirdness: According to security video showing Smollett returning to his luxury condo, he walked past building security and headed to the elevator–without notifying security that he had just been brutally beaten and attacked by chemical and rope-wielding MAGA assailants who allegedly “broke his ribs,” according to his associates who rushed to TMZ.

Ooooooookay.

The next time Smollett is seen on surveillance camera, he is entering a condo building. Police say he now has a rope around his neck and is ""wearing it like a neck tie"". About a minute (maybe less) has passed since he was seen on video. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

Smollett, according to investigators, walks in to the building, walks by building security and gets on an elevator. This video is better quality according to detectives. And what appears to be road salt is on his sweatshirt. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019"

A series of photos has revealed the intriguing daily life of the upstate Muslim enclave of Islamberg, which has recently been the target of an alleged bombing plot.

About 150 miles northwest of New York City, Islamberg was thrust into the news last week with the arrest of four suspects in a plot to massacre residents of the isolated hamlet.

The suspects were arrested in Greece, New York, about 200 miles away, and although they had never visited Islamberg, police say the suspects believed that the community is an Islamic terrorist training ground.

To the contrary, police and counterterrorism experts say there is nothing to support that theory, and neighbors say that they have had no problems with the members of the enclave.

Islamberg was founded around 1980 by followers of Pakistani cleric Sheikh Mubarik Gilani.

Mostly African-American Muslims from New York City, the residents who settled in Islamberg sought to escape crime in the city, as well as distractions from religious life.

They settled on the plot of about 60 acres of private land in Tompkins, New York near the Pennsylvania border.

The entrance to Islamberg is seen in a file photo. The community in upstate New York has about 200 residents

Today, the community has about 200 residents, and boasts its own grocery store, bookstore and school.

The community also includes homes, a mosque, and land to raise livestock and crops.

Residents of Islamberg were stunned to learn last week of the arrest of four people accused of plotting a deadly attack against the enclave.

Brian Colaneri, 20, Andrew Crysel, 18 and Vincent Vetromile, 19 were arrested after police in Greece, New York recovered three explosive devices and 23 weapons from the suspects' homes, police said. A fourth unidentified suspect, aged 16, was also detained.

It is unclear how the suspects knew each other, although the three men were in Boy Scouts together, and two attained the rank of Eagle Scouts.

Family members said that Colaneri and Crysel have Asperger's Syndrome, a 'high-functioning' disorder on the autism spectrum.

The four were arrested after a comment the 16-year-old made to fellow students in the lunch room, police said.

The student showed others a photo of someone on his phone, saying he 'looked like the next school shooter', which the other students reported to adults.

In the course of investigating, police discovered the alleged plot. The person in the photo was also questioned, but did not appear to be related and was released.

Court papers say the men had multiple, cylinder-shaped explosive devices and mason jars wrapped in duct tape and were plotting to attack Islamberg.

The Muslims Of America, a group based in Islamberg, released a statement strongly condemning the alleged plot.

'It is beyond tragic that our nation continues to fester with Islamophobia, hate and religious intolerance,' the group said.

'To bring justice and properly deter similar terrorist plots against our community, we are calling for the individuals charged, as well as their accomplices, to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.'

The latest arrests are not the first time someone has been arrested for plotting an attack on Islamberg.

In 2017, Tennessee man Robert Doggard was sentenced to nearly 20 years in federal prison after he was convicted of planning an attack on Islamberg.

Conspiracy theorists who believe the community is a terrorist training compound often point to the 2017 arrest of 64-year-old Ramadan Abdullah, who stole ammunition from a store in nearby Johnson City.

The investigation led police to a cache of high-powered weapons in a storage locker. Abdullah was sentenced to four years in prison on weapons charges.

The group has also drawn scrutiny over the founding cleric, Gilani, who also founded the violent militant group Jamaat ul-Fuqra.

In addition to this Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl was on his way to interview Gilani in Karachi over his alleged ties to shoe bomber Richard Reid when the journalist was abducted and later beheaded, but Gilani's involvement in the kidnapping was never proven.

However, state police and terrorism experts say there is little to fear from Islamberg.

'They are law-abiding,' Maj. William F. McEvoy, the State Police commander in the region, told the New York Times. 'They are positive, solid members of the community.'

'They believe in education,' McEvoy said. 'They believe in hard work. They believe in raising their children with those goals in mind.'

A 2008 analysis published in the CTC Sentinel, a journal published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, concluded that there was no evidence proving Islamberg was part of a covert training operation.

'It should also be mentioned that neither the presence of weapons (or even arsenals), nor weapons training are particularly unusual phenomena in rural America,' the authors wrote.

Islamberg residents turn out to support their town ahead of a planned motorcycle protest against the African-American Muslim community on Sunday, May 15, 2016

Bikers who rode past the town in protests were outnumbered by hundreds of cheering Islamberg supporters who gathered to defend the community from charges that it is an 'Islamic jihad training camp'

Neighbors also say that, despite initial uneasiness when Islamberg was first founded, they have come to view the community as good neighbors.

'We've never had a problem,' Nancy Furdock, who has lived in nearby Hancock for nearly two decades, told the Times.

The three recently arrested suspects in the plot against Islamberg all face three counts of first-degree criminal possession of a weapon and one count of fourth-degree conspiracy.

Under the state's new Raise the Age laws, the teen will be adjudicated as an adolescent offender. However, he could still serve state prison time if convicted of felony charges.

Crysel was released on bail from the Monroe County Jail last week.

Vetromile and Colaneri remained in jail on Friday in lieu of $50,000 cash bail or $100,000 bond. The teen was remanded to custody in lieu of $1,000,000 bail.

The teen is expected back in court on January 30, and the three men are scheduled to appear in Greece Town Court on February 5."

A new statement received by TMZ adds, that ""In the initial reports there was no mention of MAGA. When detectives followed up with [Smollett] later in the day, he recalled the offenders making those comments and detectives completed a supplemental report.""

FOX Entertainment also released a statement on the incident which says, ""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,"" and added, ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

This horrific incident experienced by Jussie is yet another example of the devastating impact of homophobia that is permeating communities across our country.

ADVERTISEMENT

Through the ongoing partnership that AHF has with casting director Robi Reed and her Reed for Hope Foundation, Jussie has been a longtime AHF community ambassador and has worked with the organization on many national campaigns in the fight against HIV/AIDS and community stigma, including a recent PSA that followed the season opening of Empire, focused on knowing your HIV status and getting tested. Jussie has been actively involved with AHF in the fight against hate, participating in the organization’s Vote 2 End Hate campaign concert during the 2016 Republican National Convention and the launch of the AHF Black AIDS Crisis Task Force, now known as the Black Leadership AIDS Crisis Coalition (BLACC). Jussie, who is open about his sexual-orientation, has been very supportive of gay pride events across this country, in his work to empower all communities around love before hate. He has continued to be a strong voice in this country on the negative impact of stigma and shame that many in the LGBTQ community are confronted with.

“As is the feeling of many around the country, it disgusted us to learn of the recent hate crime that was experienced by Jussie Smollett,” stated Samantha Granberry, AHF VP of Strategic Partnerships. “This incident again brings attention to the reality that our country is still plagued by issues of homophobia and stigma against those in the LGBTQ community. We at AHF hope this incident stands as an immediate call to action of the work that needs to be amplified in addressing this devastating social justice issue. Until all Americans are free to live their life fully, without fear of violent attacks, no matter what their sexual-orientation, gender or race, then none of us is truly free.”

According to recent hate crime statistics by the Federal Bureau Investigation (FBI), in 2016, law enforcement agencies reported 1,218 hate crime offenses based on sexual-orientation bias. Of these offenses:

AHF and BLACC applaud the diverse array of support that is being shown for all within the LGBTQ+ community and the Black American community, as marginalized communities that continue to be confronted with issues of hate and acts of violence due to discrimination. We salute Jussie for his continued showing of bravery, humanity and wish him a speedy recovery.

As we continue to join with our community partners across this nation to stand up against homophobia, stigma and hate of any kind, we encourage individuals and organizations across the nation to go to the website, ahf.org/stand-against-hate, to get involved in mobilization efforts to stand against hate across the nation.

STAND AGAINST HATE! AHF Responds to Hate Crime Against Jussie Smollett

AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), globally, the largest provider of

that was experienced by actor and advocate Jussie Smollett while in

While racism and bigotry aren’t particularly new in America, Rep. Waters says responsibility for this country’s tense racial climate begins at the top.

“Why all of a sudden do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have a picnic while black and being attacked? It’s coming from the president of the United States,” Rep. Waters told theGrio during her annual Millennial Media Row event on Tuesday night.

Rep. Waters has never been one to hold back criticisms of President Donald Trump, calling the White House the “white supremacists’ house” in the wake of racial violence in Charlottesville.

“[Trump is] separating and dividing and he is basically emboldening those folks who feel this way, maybe never said and never talked about it, never could act it out but now they’re on it,” Rep. Waters continued.

According to Chicago Police, Jussie Smollet was walking outside when two assailants called him racial and homophobic slurs to grab his attention, hitting him in the face and pouring an “unknown chemical” on him.

A TMZ report says, they yelled, “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n*****?”

In one of the most chilling details from the incident report, one of the attackers tied a rope around Smollet’s neck. The rope is more than a symbol of hate- it’s the embodiment of the lynching of black men and women, which has taken place throughout United States history.

The attack against Smollet comes at a time when the U.S. has seen an uptick in hate crimes in major cities. Department of Justice data from 2017, shows that race was the #1 bias motivation in hate crime incidents. Sexual orientation was also in the top three categories of bias motivation.

“The violence against the most marginalized members of our community is nothing new,” says David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition (NBJC), an organization which fights for the rights of Black LGBTQ people.

“Trump has escalated the violence with racist rhetoric and destructive policies that are designed to divide and keep some of us locked out of access to opportunity,” continues Johns. “The clearest consequences of these deleterious actions are evident in these examples of vitriol, violence, even death.”

Rep. Waters, who was presented a “Black Girls Rock!” award by Smollett in 2017, says after news about the attack broke, she immediately called one of Smollett’s sisters to check on his condition.

“I was on my way to Chicago to see about him,” Rep. Waters told theGrio. “I love him. He’s a fantastic human being. He’s so giving. He shows up at all the community events. You know he does a lot working with the community. He comes from that kind of family.”"

News of the early morning attack left the entertainment world reeling and gay advocacy groups speaking out in support of the 36-year-old actor.

Smollett was beaten at around 2 am by two attackers who yelled ""racial and homophobic slurs"" while he walked downtown in the third-biggest US city, said police, who did not name him but said the victim was an actor from Empire.



Smollett's fellow cast members and production company identified him as the victim.

The attackers poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, and then wrapped a rope around the actor's neck, according to police.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" the Chicago Police Department said.

The actor and singer was reportedly in Chicago for a scheduled Saturday concert.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, who on the weekend launched her 2020 campaign to be America's first black female president, called the incident ""an attempted modern day lynching.""

""No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate,"" Harris said on Twitter.

Members of the Empire production team and cast, as well as the studio that produces the program, also spoke out.

""The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate – and especially against one of our own,"" 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.

The show's co-creator Lee Daniels posted an Instagram video calling Jussie ""my son.""

""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,"" Daniels said, addressing the actor.

""Hold your head up Jussie. I'm with you. I'll be there in a minute. It's just another fucking day in America,"" he said.

Advocacy groups including the The Trevor Project and the American Civil Liberties Union, quickly offered their support as well.

""LGBTQ people of color live at multiple intersections of oppression, too often facing violence compounded by both racism and homophobia,"" the ACLU said.

""I don't mind being the problem that may lead to a solution at some point."" This remark was made in reference to the criticism the songstress has received for her contributions to difficult conservations held on social media. Badu has already landed herself in another squabble with Twitter users following the upsetting news relating to Empire star, Jussie Smollett.

Reports state the actor was hospitalized after a hate crime in which the assailants used a rope and bleach. In what appeared to be a response to the virtual uproar relating to the incident, Erykah came through with her usual message of ""unconditional love."" She questioned whether the public was being manipulated by the headlines. She asked is every had all the facts straight since ""every headline written about me was all out of context and manipulated to trigger YOUR outrage.""

Of course, this caused some blowback. Some wondered why her statement placed the focus back on her. Others were disappointed that the public's response to the attack was being questioned at all. The singer was quick to explain her statement. ""This is not in ref to my brother Jussie. This is across the Board. Period,"" she warned ""Don’t try it, fam.""

While she claims the comment was not about Smollett, the tweet that followed the one that caused the latest backlash stated, ""Love to Jussie."" She also engaged with the criticism that directly named the actor's current predicament causing more confusion amongst her following.

""I was encouraging the group to wait for the FACTS before making a sound judgment on ANYTHING,"" she later clarified. ""I used my situation as an example. At the same time I received news our bro Jussie was attacked. I had already started this convo when I was alerted.The two were entangled."""

Smollett headed to the hospital to get his injuries checked out after two men in ski masks jumped the Empire star early Tuesday morning. Police revealed that men were yelling racist and homophobic slurs at the actor as they beat him.

Details about the suspects have not been revealed as investigators search for video surveillance to help find those responsible for the attack.

""Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire,"" a statement from the Chicago Police Department to press read. ""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com.""

Smollett has not spoken publicly on the attack so far, though sources told Entertainment Tonight he was understandably ""shaken up"" by the encounter.

""Jussie tried to protect himself and at one point the men poured a substance on him believed to be bleach and one of the guys put a rope around his neck,"" a source said. ""After some time the men fled the scene and Jussie went to the hospital.""

""Jussie is mostly physically O.K. with some scrapes and bruises, but he's more emotionally shook up,"" they added.

Since news broke of the attack, many celebrities have spoken out in support of the actor.

20th Century Fox also issued a statement writing, ""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice."""

Gwyneth Paltrow is being sued by a man who alleges she crashed into him whilst skiing in Utah three years ago.

The 46-year-old reportedly faces a $3.1 million (£2.3million) claim from Terry Sanderson, 72, who claims the actress took off after causing a collision that left him with a concussion, brain injury and four broken ribs.

The accident took place at the Deer Valley Resort, Utah, back in February 2016 and he is now seeking compensation for a loss of enjoyment of life, emotional distress, disfigurement and medical expenses.

According to documents obtained by TMZ, Sanderson alleges Gwyneth was responsible for the ski incident because she lost control of her skis, bumped into him from behind and knocked him over.

He accuses her of picking herself back up and continuing on her way along the beginner run without checking if he was okay, until a ski instructor stopped to accuse him of causing the crash.

The man believes the instructor filed a false report casting blame on him in an attempt to protect Gwyneth.

He is now seeking damages from the Shallow Hal star and is also taking legal action against Deer Valley Resort for the alleged actions of the instructor.

Gwyneth – who has daughter Apple, 14, and son Moses, 12, with her ex-husband Chris Martin – is yet to comment on the lawsuit, but her spokeswoman Heather Wilson said the case was ‘without merit’, and she expects the actress will be ‘vindicated’.

Emily Summers, spokesperson for Deer Valley Resort, said she could not comment on pending legal matters.

Police did not release the actor’s name but a statement from Fox, which airs “Empire,” identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime. Smollett is black and openly gay.

According to a police statement, the actor was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an “unknown substance” on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that when officers first came in contact with Smollett, he still had a rope around his neck. While being interviewed by detectives, Guglielmi said Smollett told them that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The police spokesman added that the two men were wearing masks. Investigators have not found any surveillance video or witnesses from which they can put together a description of the offenders, he said.

Smollett was able to take himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was last reported in good condition.

Guglielmi also said the FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago last week.

The hourlong drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Jamal Lyon, Smollett’s character, is the gay, middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Tuesday in support of Smollett. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence,” the statement read.

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels also voiced his support for Smollett in an Instagram video.

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” Daniels said. “You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.”

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

“He is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I’ve ever met,” Harris said Tuesday, adding that she’s still learning more details about the incident.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues and he released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

“Empire” is shot in Chicago and a Fox spokeswoman said the program is currently in production."

The Empire star was allegedly attacked by two men wearing ski masks in the early hours of Jan. 29 in Chicago. TMZ first reported that Smollett had identified the two attackers as white, and that he had told police that they had yelled, “This is MAGA country!”.

However, the Chicago Police Department has disputed that he told them that, at least initially, or identified the race of the attackers, who allegedly used racist and homophobic language and placed a rope around Smollett’s neck. The Daily Beast reported that Chicago police said the race and gender of the alleged assailants remained unknown.

Additionally, in their initial report, Jussie Smollett did not tell police his attackers yelled “MAGA.” Chicago Police PIO added: “I’m not saying it’s not true. He could have remembered later, but he did not tell officers that in the initial report.” 2/2 — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 29, 2019

Smollett drove himself to a nearby hospital. The incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson issued a statement Tuesday afternoon specifically blaming Trump’s “racist and xenophobic rhetoric”:

The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling. The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric. It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse. As this rhetoric continues to bleed into our everyday lives, dangerous behavior will continue to place many law-abiding individuals at risk. We pray for a full physical and mental recovery Jussie Smollett and many unnamed victims of this forum of hate based terrorism.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is a candidate for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, called the alleged attack on Smollett a “modern day lynching.”

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett was attacked on Tuesday morning while leaving a restaurant in what Chicago police are calling a possible hate crime.

The 36-year-old actor was exiting a restaurant in Chicago when two men started shouting racial and homophobic slurs towards him before attacking Smollett, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

They punched him, poured an unknown chemical substance over him and one of the suspects even wrapped a rope around the actor’s neck.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said in a statement to THR.

The police said the suspects were two males in black clothing. One of them was wearing a black mask.

Smollett, who was hospitalised for his injuries, told the police that the attackers yelled pro-”Make America Great Again” comments during the attack.

On the show, Smollett plays musician Jamal Lyon, the son of Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie (Taraji P Henson). The character is gay and so is the actor in real life.

The show’s team has expressed shock and anger over the attack on Smollett.

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels said the actor did not deserve what happened to him.

“It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie, you are my son. You didn’t deserve, nor anyone deserves, to have a noose put around your neck; to have bleach thrown on you... you are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are,” Daniels said.

Co-creator Danny Strong said, “I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett. He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live. Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

Brian Grazer, the executive producer of the show, said he was “disgusted and saddened by the attack” on Smollett, adding, “Hate and bigotry have no place in our society.”"

Cory Booker is among the many who have condemned a reported racist and homophobic attack on actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago.

Chicago police said Smollett, 36, who is known for playing the singer Jamal Lyon on the Fox series “Empire,” was beaten by two men at about 2 a.m. on Tuesday after they made him the target of homophobic and racist slurs. During the attack, in which Smollett was hit in the face, one of two suspects put a rope around the actor’s neck. They also reportedly poured “an unknown chemical substance” on Smollett, who went to a hospital for treatment after the attack.

The actor, who is reportedly in good condition, told CNN he fought back when he was attacked and was both angry and shaken after the incident.

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching,” Booker tweeted on Tuesday. “I’m glad he’s safe. To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention.”

Police in Chicago said they were investigating the incident as “a possible hate crime.” Smollett, who is also a singer, had been in Chicago to perform at a concert this Saturday. He is also filming “Empire” in the city.

TMZ reports that the suspects were white and wore ski masks as they shouted “this is MAGA country"" at Smollett during the assault, which occurred when Smollett went out for food after flying into the city. But speaking to the Daily Beast, Chicago police dispute those details.

“There is no report of that being said,"" they told the outlet. Later on Tuesday, ABC reported that police said Smollett confirmed the “MAGA country” detail in a follow-up interview.

TMZ also reports the men who struck the actor yelled the N-word and a homophobic slur as Smollett walked back from Subway, and that the “chemical substance” was bleach. TMZ says that a week before the assault, a letter containing slurs and a death threat had been sent to Fox Studios in Chicago and addressed to Smollett. The report adds that armed security will be provided for Smollett and the “Empire” cast as they film the rest of the season.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,"" Fox said in a statement. ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Smollett came out as gay in 2015. His “Empire” character is also gay.

Lee Daniels, co-creator of “Empire,” addressed the assault on Smollett on Instagram Tuesday.

“Jussie, you are my son,” Daniels said in a video (see below). “You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called “die f***** n***** or whatever they said to you.”

“Empire” debuted in 2015 and has run for five seasons on Fox. Smollett began his career with appearances in films including “The Mighty Ducks” (1992). He was also a regular on the short-lived ABC TV show “On Our Own” in 1994 and 1995 alongside his five brothers and sisters.

“Empire” co-creator Danny Strong also commented on the attack, saying he’s “deeply horrified and saddened” by the assault on Smollett.

“The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,” Strong tweeted. “Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

On social media, many more people responded to the attack on Smollett. They also commented on the hesitation of some media outlets to label the incident a racist, homophobic hate crime.

Reporting honestly on what happened to Jussie Smollett requires use of the words ""racist"" and ""homophobic.""

""The vicious, racist and homophobic attack against @JussieSmollett is a reminder of the real violence Black LGBTQ ppl face everyday & the hate this administration continues to embolden,"" the activist group Color of Change tweeted. ""Our support + love go out to #JussieSmollet [sic] as he continues to recover.""

In a tweet, Sen. Kamala Harris said that Smollett is ""one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know"" and called the assault an ""attempted modern day lynching.""

""No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin,"" Harris wrote on Twitter. ""We must confront this hate.

But Andrew Guglielmit, the department's chief communications officer, wrote on Twitter that ""thus far we have not found anything to be able put out a description"" of the assailants.

In its 2017 hate crimes statistics report, the FBI found that 28 percent of hate crime incidents targeted black people, while around 15 percent targeted LGBTQ people.

Because of the nature of the reported slurs targeting both his race and his sexual orientation, Smollett would be considered the victim of a ""multi-bias"" hate crime incident. There were 69 such hate crimes in 2017, according to FBI data.

""Jussie Smollett was targeted because of his race and sexuality,"" comedian Gabe Gonzales tweeted. ""This is why mere visibility isn't enough. Combatting homophobia and racism must involve calling out and holding accountable people in power or groups who seek to normalize hate like this.""

""The racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in a tweet. ""We must come together to eradicate all forms of bigotry and violence.""

These crimes, which are usually based on race, gender and religion, are plaguing cities across the nation and Chicago is the latest one to fall victim. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, a member of Empire's cast was reportedly assaulted. Fortunately, Empire star Jussie Smollett is reportedly in ""good"" condition after a suspected hate crime.

Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on Fox's hit show Empire, is the victim of a ""possible racially-charged assault and battery,"" according to the Chicago Police Department.

Smollett had just returned from New York and decided to head out to a fast food restaurant, according to a report from TMZ. Shortly after he left his home, he was allegedly approached by two white men wearing ski masks who called him racial and homophobic slurs. Although Smollett allegedly fought back, he was beaten and received a broken rib from the incident.

The men also allegedly poured an unknown chemical liquid on him and tied a rope around his neck, according to CNN. Some reports are reporting that the attackers yelled, ""This is MAGA Country,"" the news outlet also noted.

MAGA is the acronym for Trump's campaign slogan Make American Great Again. It's also the term emblazoned on red hats that Trump supporters wear in solidarity, according to The Nation.

The actor took himself to a local hospital and was released early Tuesday morning, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Just eight days ago, Fox Studios in Chicago allegedly received a threatening letter addressed to Smollett, according to a report from TMZ. The letter's return address said ""MAGA.""

Both the Smollett and his Empire character, identify as gay, according to CNN.

GLAAD reportedly reached out to Smollett offering its assistance and support, according to Deadline.

""Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,"" a GLAAD spokesperson said in a statement.

While the police did not release the name of the victim, 20th Century Fox confirmed it was Smollett in a prepared statement, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,"" studio officials said in the statement. ""The entire studio, network, and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.""

The rest of Hollywood also joined in to show their support.

The attack is being investigated as a possible hate crime, according to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, Chicago's CBS affiliate reported.

As for what's being done now, police are reportedly currently looking at surveillance videos from an apartment building and nearby stores for leads, according to TMZ.

Unfortunately, these types of attacks are becoming more common. Hate crimes rose 17 percent from 2016 to 2017, according to the New York Times. However, hate crimes are often underreported, so the actual number may be higher.

In 2017, the Chicago Police Department reported 41 hates crimes, which were reportedly motivated by race, gender, and religion, according to the New York Times.

The Chicago Police Department did not return Romper's request for comment.

There is still a lot of investigating work to be done, but anyone with information about the incident is urged to call Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382. Here's hoping the alleged assailants are caught. In the meantime, prayers go out to Smollett and his family."

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago early Tuesday morning in what police are calling a possible hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed to HuffPost it had received a report Tuesday morning that a cast member on the Fox drama was the victim of a “possible racially-charged assault and battery.” Smollett was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after the attack but has already been released. Police said he is in “good condition.”

The FBI has taken over the investigation amid reports that Smollett received a threatening letter sometime before the attack, according to ABC News.

Police reported that two unknown men began “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” before physically attacking the actor. During the attack, the two men “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him and one of the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck.

TMZ, citing unnamed sources “directly connected to Jussie,” reported that the men yelled, “Aren’t you that faggot ‘Empire’ nigger?” The outlet also reported that the unknown chemical substance was bleach and that, after the attack, the men told Smollett, “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police told HuffPost Tuesday morning. “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.”

The actor came out as gay during an interview on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” in 2015.

“It was a bigger deal to everyone than it was for me. But at the same time I do understand why it is something to talk about,” Smollett said at the time, adding, “I was ready to talk about it. She told me, ‘You don’t have to.’ I will be forever grateful to Ellen for the kindness she showed me. And that made me want to talk about it.”

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said that the company is “deeply saddened and outraged” by the attack.

“We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,” the company wrote in a statement. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

People, including actress Zendaya and the Rev. Al Sharpton, reacted to the terrible news on Twitter.

Chad Griffin, president of Human Rights Campaign, noted that the violence against Smollett was part of a pattern: “This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident. There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities ― and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities.”

As CrimeOnline previously reported, Jussie Smollett was reportedly attacked early Tuesday morning while exiting a Subway restaurant in Chicago.

In addition to the homophobic and racist taunts allegedly shouted at the 35-year-old “Empire” star, earlier reports indicate he was the recipient of a threatening letter declaring “You will die black f*g” and displaying a hand-drawn image of a stick figure being shot.

That letter was reportedly sent on January 22 and contained an unidentified powdery substance.

According to ABC News, additional details have surfaced regarding the circumstances surrounding the alleged attack.

The FBI is reportedly involved in a probe into the letter sent prior to the attack. Two men are accused of taking part in the incident, which included tying a noose around Smollett’s neck and covering him in what officials described as “an unknown chemical substance.”

Investigators say the victim was discovered after the attack with the rope still around his neck.

Reports indicate police have reviewed surveillance footage prior to the alleged attack, which shows Smollett inside of an area Subway restaurant. As of the latest update available, investigators had not confirmed they had recovered any video of suspects.

Smollett spoke to police after the incident and said the assailants yelled offensive taunts and told him he was in “MAGA country” in an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

The creator of the “Empire” series released a statement to the actor, insisting that he did not deserve the type of treatment described in the complaint.

“Hold your head up Jussie, I’m with you,” Lee Daniels said. “I’ll be there in a minute.”

The Fox series’ executive producer also issued a statement describing himself as “deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks” against Smollett.

“We re deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” Fox confirmed in its own public statement. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.”

Viewers watched in disbelief on Tuesday night as controversial contestant Liv announced to the group that she’d ‘shit herself’.

Not only did she share the moment sitting beside Casey, and watched by the rest of the nation, but loudmouthed Liv couldn’t help but shout it over to the group while she rushed off to the toilet.

Liv was having a deep chat under the trees with new islander Casey, when she went off topic to announce, ‘I need to fart’.

Standing up tentatively, Liv couldn’t stop giggling as she shouted to the rest of the islanders, ‘Guys, I’ve actually just shit myself.’

And so the overlap with Love Island is dead. This is what island life looks like without the beauty filter.

Viewers at home didn’t exactly find the cold hard reality of a rice and beans diet too funny and took to Twitter to express their revulsion.

‘Did Liv actually [poop]? Cos she’s not changed out of that bikini…’ one fan observed.

In disbelief, another asked: ‘Did Liv just shit herself, really?’

Another declared, ‘Where the actual hell did they find Liv?’

The firecracker Mancunian has already caused quite a stir on the island, launching into two arguments in as many days on the E4 show.

Liv argued with Big T in the first episode on Monday and even exploded at Josh on his first day on the island.

However, presenter Vick Hope tells Metro.co.uk there’s more conflict to come from the other contestants.

‘I can tell you now she is not the most volatile person there by a long stretch,’ Vick said. ‘Get ready for way, way more conflict from other people.’

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett has confirmed that his attackers yelled pro-“MAGA” slurs at him, including, “Trump country,” according to multiple news outlets. Smollett was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack that took place around 2 AM Tuesday morning. His attackers reportedly tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach over him, beat him, and fractured one of his ribs.

Some on the right had claimed that Chicago police were denying claims that Jussie Smollett heard his attackers use “MAGA” slurs.

Several news outlets including TMZ and The Hollywood Reporter, however, have confirmed with police that Smollett indeed reported the slurs.

TMZ reports that “Chicago PD confirms to TMZ Jussie told them, in a follow-up interview, about the attackers yelling, ‘MAGA country.'”

And in a chilling addition to their reporting, TMZ notes that Chicago police “add Jussie still had the rope around his neck when he made contact with cops at 2:42 AM.”

The Hollywood Reporter also confirms the MAGA slurs.

“Around 4:35 p.m. [PST], police confirmed to THR that Smollett told them his attackers yelled pro-‘Make America Great Again’ (MAGA) comments during the attack, such a ‘MAGA country!'”

“The comments were not mentioned in the initial report but were added to a supplemental report after another interview with detectives, police told THR.”

Curiously, TMZ’s initial report, which was published just after 11 AM ET, included the “MAGA” slurs, so it’s unclear why Chicago police claim they did not have that information until hours later.

Here’s NBC News’ report from Tuesday evening:

But then social media helped mobilized guests to give him a massive send off.

However, members of Walker’s family claims that they were blindsided by the funeral.

“He’s not alone,” Dana Williams, Walker’s niece told Austin ABC affiliate KVUE. “He has two surviving brothers, and he also has a niece and a nephew, and my mother has six kids.

READ MORE: REPORT: ‘Empire’ star Jussie Smollett hospitalized after MAGA supporters beat him and put noose around his neck “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*gger’

“It’s just very heartbreaking,” she added. “I’m very angry that our uncle was laid to rest again and none of his immediate family was there.”

Williams says that they hadn’t heard from the funeral home and their last communication was about payment. The funeral home says that they reached out to Walker’s brother and he never responded.

Joseph died of cancer in November at the age of 72 and the funeral home had tried in vain for weeks to reach any of his family members. Walker’s funeral was Monday at the Central Texas State Veterans Cemetery in Kileen, and there was a fear that he was at risk of being buried without anyone in attendance.

“We have the distinct honor to provide a full military burial for unaccompanied United States Air Force Veteran Joseph Walker on MONDAY, JANUARY 28, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. at Central Texas State Veterans Cemetery,” the cemetery posted on Facebook. “If you have the opportunity, please come out and attend. We do NOT leave Veterans behind.”

With no family or loved ones answering the funeral home’s calls, Walker was classified as an “unaccompanied veteran.” The call immediately went viral with people around Texas and across the country mobilizing for Walker.

The story reached KVUE and was eventually tweeted out by local motorcycle clubs, Republican Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and CNN anchor Jake Tapper:

ATTN TEXANS No one is expected to attend the funeral for Joseph Walker, who served in the US Air Force 1964-1968. His funeral will take place Monday at 10 a.m. at the Central Texas State Cemetery. 11463 SH 195

“Today, we’re not strangers; today, we are family, ” Marc George of the Christian Motorcyclists Association, who officiated the funeral told NPR. “This is our brother, Joseph Walker.”

Photos on social media showed the road to the cemetery was clogged with cars with people who wanted to be there for Walker. Unfortunately, it seems, Walker’s family wanted to be there for him, too. But they were not informed.

“I love my uncle and I miss him dearly,” she said. “I feel like we let him down because we were not there today.”"

The Fox drama series “Empire” kept to its production schedule today following a vicious attack on one of its stars, Jussie Smollett, Variety reports, citing a source.

“The Fox show’s production schedule remains ‘fluid’ for the rest of the week, according to the source. It is not yet known how Smollett’s injuries will ultimately impact production on the current season, which would typically wrap in March,” Variety reports. Fox declined to comment on the show’s production.

As we reported previously, Smollett was attacked in Chicago in the early-morning hours today in what is widely believed to be a hate crime. Two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an unknown liquid on him. TMZ has reported that the liquid was bleach.

Variety reports that the investigation into the attack has been handed over to the FBI. Smollett had reportedly received a letter last week threatening him and using racially charged language and homophobic slurs. TMZ noted that the FBI was already investigating the letter.

TMZ reports that Chicago police confirmed Smollett told them in a follow-up interview that his attackers yelled “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the political slogan “Make America great again.”

The TMZ report cites sources connected with “Empire” saying Smollett and the rest of the main cast members will have armed security during the rest of the time they’re shooting in Chicago.

TMZ adds: “‘Empire’ staff held an emergency meeting Tuesday morning in Chicago to tell everyone what happened to Jussie. We’re told the cast and crew were extremely upset. Several actors were already in their trailers getting ready to shoot when they got the news.”"

TMZ reports Smollett, who is black, was attacked by two white men in ski masks who allegedly pulled a noose around his neck and shouted racial slurs while beating him, fracturing a rib.

Now, TMZ has an update from the Chicago PD. The department says Jussie told them in an interview that the men were yelling “MAGA country.” MAGA stands for President Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

The site also reports Smollett, who has been released from the hospital, still had the noose around his neck when police spoke to him nearly 45 minutes after the attack. They are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Earlier, in a statement to ""Extra,"" Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Spokesperson of the Chicago Police Department, said, ""Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show ‘Empire.’ Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.

""Extra"" has obtained the dispatch call, which noted that Jussie ""was assaulted when he walked out of his apartment.”

An insider tells Variety that filming has continued on the set of ""Empire,"" while a source tells TMZ that Jussie and his co-stars will now have armed security while filming in Chicago.

""Empire"" co-creator Lee Daniels shared his emotional reaction to the attack on Instagram. He said in part, ""You didn’t deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die f--got n--ga’ or whatever they said to you.

ThatGrapeJuice.Net reports that the 35-year-old was the subject of a threatening letter received by Fox Studios in Chicago that was sent over a week before the attack, which read, “You will die black f--.” You can see a photo of the letter here.

Before the incident, Jussie documented his flight to Chicago after it was delayed in NYC.

According to TMZ, the actor was walking on his way home at around 2 a.m., when an unknown man yelled at him, “Aren’t you that f*ggot Empire n****?”

While the outlet insisted that the two men who beat him and put a rope around his neck were white MAGA supporters, it is important to note that according to other outlets, police cleared that the race of the perpetrators were not identified, and they “have no record indicating that [they shouted ‘MAGA’], we only have record of them shouting racial and homophobic slurs at him.” Additionally, the men poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him.

Thankfully, Jussie is now confirmed to be in good condition, and has been released from the hospital.

This is horrendous news. And even more alarming is that pop culture website That Grape Juice released a photo online of a letter allegedly sent to Jussie at Fox Studios eight days ago that read in cut-out letters: “You will die black fag.” They claim this is proof that the attack was premeditated.

The attack is currently being investigated as a hate crime, according to USA Today. “While details are still developing, the hate violence Jussie Smollett experienced is reflective of what we see in our national data on hate violence,” the New York City Anti-Violence Project said in a statement. “LGBTQ people living at multiple intersections of oppression, such as racism and homophobia, experience compounded violence.” They further stressed, “Jussie is not alone. Gay Black men are some of the most vulnerable to violence in the LGBTQ community and this must continue to be addressed.”

On Tuesday, Michelle Pfeiffer hopped on her newly created Instagram account to tease the very first image of her character in the upcoming “Maleficent” sequel — Queen Ingrith. In the photo, the veteran actress wears a shimmering silver garment with her hair up in curls strewn with tiny pearls. Likewise, a several-stranded pearl necklace seems to hang between two brooches beside her temples in the cutoff image.

“A little tease of Queen Ingrith,” the 61-year-old actress captioned the photo, adding the “Maleficent “2hashtag.

While the first film, starring Angelina Jolie as the titular character, provided a new, slightly darker live-action interpretation of Sleeping Beauty, the next movie will take these characters into totally new territory.

Here’s the official logline: “A fantasy adventure that picks up several years after ‘Maleficent’, in which audiences learned of the events that hardened the heart of Disney’s most notorious villain and drove her to curse a baby Princess Aurora, ‘Maleficent 2’ continues to explore the complex relationship between the horned fairy (Jolie) and the soon to be Queen (Elle Fanning), as they form new alliances and face new adversaries in their struggle to protect the moors and the magical creatures that reside within.”

Although filming wrapped on the project last August, it will not be making its way to theatres until May 29, 2020.

Meanwhile, Pfeiffer has been hard at work playing Janet Van Dyne in the upcoming “Avengers: Endgame”, while Jolie has claimed her next project, “Those Who Wish Me Dead“. The film is a thriller adapted from the bestselling novel of the same name by Michael Koryta. The story follows a 13-year-old boy who has hidden inside a wilderness skills program after witnessing a brutal murder. While hiding out, the killers are on a warpath, slaughtering anyone who gets in their way of reaching the boy.

As of now, it’s unclear what Jolie’s role will be in the film, which will be directed by Taylor Sheridan.

‘Empire’ Star Jussie Smollett Attacked in Possible Hate Crime: Police

The Chicago Police Department said 36-year-old Empire star Jussie Smollett told authorities he was assaulted early Tuesday morning by two suspects who yelled out “racial and homophobic slurs” before the attack. Smollett told police that the suspects hit him in the face around 2 a.m. and “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him, according to the statement. “At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck,” the police statement says. “The offenders fled the scene.” Police said Smollett was still wearing the rope around his neck when he contacted police, and investigators now intend to analyze it. Authorities later said that Smollett told police in a follow-up interview that his attackers screamed “MAGA country.” Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital and is in “good condition,” authorities said.

This is an obvious false flag operation. It has all the right markers: “Trump white supremacist facists shouting/wearing MAGA slogans. Publicity hound black low level tv celebrity. I really like the part where he leaves the “noose” tied around his neck.

No witnesses. No video of tje attack. Nothing but this jizzbag’s word.

False. Flag. All the way.

I’ll bet some of the CuckShed Cruisers will jump all over it to condemn Trump and has racist, homophobic white supremacist deplorable supporters.

Police say the attack occurred at a dilapidated park well known for being a favorite of the homeless. “Anyone who may hv been in area of 300 E North Water St btwn 1-3a should send info to…”

It’s called Ogden Plaza Park, and it’s a dump. Here’s a rundown on it:

Cityfront Center a cautionary tale — Chicago Tribune

Bad public spaces do none of that, as revealed by a small piece of Cityfront Center — Ogden Plaza Park, a sloping 1-acre parcel across Columbus Drive from the NBC Tower. A man sleeps Sept. 27, 2018, in Ogden Plaza Park, a public space on the east side of Columbus Drive and Illinois Street. Dog walkers and other passers-by typically remain on the plaza’s edges. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) The plaza’s pavement is cracked. In its center, the hands of a floor clock sculpture by artist Vito Acconci are gone. Homeless men camp out behind the plaza’s concrete walls, leading other people, like Kari Boyer, a claims specialist who works nearby, to remain on the park’s edges. Once, Boyer recalled, she saw human feces in the park, which was pretty unappetizing as she ate lunch.

I’ll bet. And I’ll bet it was even more unappetizing when this likely faker was wandering around at one o’clock in the the morning, and just happened to run into some people carrying bleach and lynch nooses on the off chance some gay black celebrity happened to wander by. The bleach and noose are the tell – and they are what convinces me this is nothing more than a publicity stunt.

This thing stinks from so many angles I’m amazed even the worst of the lefty media commisars or the CuckShed Cruisers would fall for it, but you know.

It so perfectly fits the desired narrative that some, at least, won’t be able to resist.

It's rumored that during the attack, one assailant screamed, “This is a MAGA country” and yelled: “Aren’t you that faggot Empire (anti-black slur)?” The Chicago Police Department and FBI are now conducting an investigation into whether this incident was a hate crime, however we as Black queer people know the truth: It was.

We know this because everyday our multiple marginalized identities increase our chances of facing racist, homophobic vitriol — and this fact has only intensified under the Trump administration with their dog whistle politics. So as we wait to see if justice is served for Smollett, we as Black queer people wait to see if America will finally see our lives as worth protecting.

Because history has rarely been on the side of Black queer folk.

Several celebrities are speaking out about Smollett’s attack. People like Viola Davis, Ava Duvernay, and Janet Mock, among others, have tweeted messages in solidarity and pushing for calling the attack a hate crime. Many politicians, including Senator Cory Booker and presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris, are calling on Congress to pass their joint Anti-Lynching Bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime. However, historically black queer men’s experiences are rarely counted as such because our being black and queer often gets ignored.

In November 2018, in an op-ed for Slate, I tackled the issue of hate crimes legislation and how we view hate and identity in light of the Shepard-Byrd Act’s 10th anniversary. “But that call [to action] rarely, if ever, considered the intersectional nature of identity, the fact that some of us are black and queer. And that oversight has profound consequences for people like me.” Once again, I am reminded of the violent blows that may be placed onto my body for living as an openly Black gay man.

Of the total number of homicides against LGBTQ people in 2017, 60 percent were Black while 23 percent of victims were white, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs. And the prior year was the deadliest year ever for LGBTQ people, noting that out of the 28 reported hate violence homicides, apart from the tragedy at Pulse, 79 percent were people of color.

But we don’t have to look to studies to observe how society renders Black queer men as useless. Just last month in Buzzfeed, writer George Johnson discussed the wealth, class, and privilege of Democratic donor Ed Buck and the two Black queer men found dead in his home — Gemmel Moore in 2017 and Timothy Dean in 2019. A lawyer representing Buck told reporters that his client was innocent and then victim-blamed Moore and Dean.

""This is a situation where Mr. Buck has had longtime friends who, unfortunately, do not handle their life well,” he said. It was a similar story to the one told when Moore was first found dead in Buck’s home in July 2017. Buck has yet to be charged for either death.

And even if survivors of this violence that has made recent headlines were primarily poor — like Moore was — Smollett’s attacks show us that class won’t save us either. Because if a famous Black queer man like him can be attacked by two white supremacist assailants, what does this mean for those with minimal support and access to resources?

Make no mistake: wealth does not stop forms of institutional violence — racist, homophobic, or otherwise. Being thrust into the limelight does not stop the intersection of marginalized identities, particularly given a hostile climate which devalues Black queer lives. Contrary to popular belief, visibility does not protect us and may exacerbate harm, not curtail it.

Nonetheless, for Black queer people who are often viewed as more readily disposable (e.g. people who are poor, drug users, sex workers, or otherwise systematically marginalized), it is hard not to believe that the violence we face will be imminent.

Smollett has rightfully received an outpouring of support from so many around the world but if his celebrity didn’t protect him, then none of us are safe from racist individuals and institutional violence. And while it does appear the police and prosecutors could bring hate crime charges, this won’t stop the larger systems of violence faced every day.

What happened to Smollett was an attempted modern day lynching and it’s time for America to look deep within its past and reconcile the harm it has caused — and will no doubt continue to cause — Black queer people, who live at the intersection of blackness and queerness every day.

For his part, 50 used his Twitter account to send positive energy to Smollett hours after TMZ reported the assault. “Sending Prayers to @jussiesmollett we hope his attackers are quickly brought to justice,” wrote 50.

Meanwhile on Instagram, T.I. expressed anger over Smollet’s attack and showed his support for the actor.“It’s a Disgusting Fuckking shame we continue to allow this shit to happen to OUR PEOPLE with no recourse!!!!” he wrote. “THE HITS WONT STOP UNTIL WE HIT BACK!!!!

Other music artists like Twista, Questlove, Xzibit, Black Thought and others sent their well-wishes and prayers to Smollett.

The Empire star was attacked in the early morning hours on Tuesday in what Chicago police are calling a possible hate crime, reports CNN.

According law enforcement, the openly gay Smollett was attacked by two people who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"" before they poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" onto the actor. One of Smollett's alleged attackers also put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing on foot.

Smollett was able to escort himself to Northwestern Hospital and ""is in good condition."" Chicago police have no suspects and the investigation is still ongoing.

According to CNN, police were able to obtain footage from a security camera. The only image of Smollett police saw was him standing alone inside a Subway sandwich shop but not the actual assault itself. Smollett told CNN he fought back at the attackers.

Reps for 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement. It reads: ""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett said his attackers yelled ""MAGA country"" during the assault, Chicago police confirmed to CBS News.

As of Tuesday evening, police said they had yet to find surveillance video that showed the crime. ""Thus far, no video of the alleged assailants or a vehicle has been discovered but we are continuing to broaden our search,"" Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.

TMZ first reported details of the attack.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Guglielmi said in a statement.

The victim went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Guglielmi said the man was being treated at the hospital and is in good condition. The statement said the victim is cooperating fully with investigators.

""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to CBS News. ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.""

Fellow members of the television industry, fans and advocates including the NAACP, GLAAD and the Anti-Violence project took to social media Tuesday to condemn the alleged assault.

NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson said in a statement the group is ""beyond troubled to hear about the recent racist and homophobic fueled attack on NAACP Image Award winner, acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett."" GLAAD called for the incident to be investigated thoroughly.

""Empire"" co-creator Danny Strong said he was ""deeply saddened and horrified"" by the incident.

I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett. He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live... — Danny Strong (@Dannystrong) January 29, 2019

""Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come,"" Strong tweeted.

FBI data released last year showed a 17 percent increase in hate crimes between 2016 and 2017. Hate crimes based on race, ethnicity or ancestry were the most common, making up about 60 percent of the total. The FBI's latest report also found 15.8 percent of hate crime offenses in 2017 stemmed from sexual orientation bias. Between 2016 and 2017, hate crimes motivated by racial bias rose about 18 percent and attacks on LGBTQ individuals rose 5 percent, according to the FBI.

The Anti-Violence project notes the severity of hate violence against LGBTQ people is increasing, with 46 percent of LGBTQ hate violence victims sustaining an injury in 2017 compared with 31 percent in 2016.

Chicago Police said they're continuing to seek evidence and video in the case to identify possible offenders. So far, police haven't developed information to be able to put out a suspect description, Guglielmi tweeted Tuesday afternoon.

Empire producers are taking extra precautions to protect actors after a ‘racist and homophobic’ attack on Jussie Smollett.

Filming will reportedly continue on the Fox series in Chicago under the protection of armed security staff, TMZ reports.

The Jamal Lyon actor was ‘brutally attacked’ by two men wearing ski masks at around 2am on Tuesday morning in an incident police are investigating as a ‘possible hate crime’.

Insiders tell Entertainment Tonight that an emergency meeting was held on Tuesday while some actors had already arrived on set for shooting.

It was decided that security would be stepped up to the final episodes in the series, though it has not yet been confirmed whether Jussie will return to filming.

A statement from Fox said: ‘We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night.

‘We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

‘The entire studio, network and production stand united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.’

Several of the actors are said to be ‘extremely upset’ by the news, while Empire boss Lee Daniels shared a public video urging the actor to ‘hold his head up’.

Attackers are alleged to have beaten up Jussie, ‘put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him’.

Just eight days ago, a death threat addressed to Jussie was alleged to have been sent to Fox Studios in Chicago.

CHICAGO, Jan 20 — Black, openly-gay actor Jussie Smollett of the US television programme Empire was hospitalised yesterday in Chicago following a possibly hate-motivated attack in which assailants tied a rope around his neck, police and his co-workers said.

News of the early morning attack left the entertainment world reeling and gay advocacy groups speaking out in support of the 36-year-old actor.

Smollett was beaten at around 2:00am by two attackers who yelled “racial and homophobic slurs” while he walked downtown in the third-biggest US city, said police, who did not name him but said the victim was an actor from Empire.

Smollett’s fellow cast members and production company identified him as the victim.

The attackers poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him, and then wrapped a rope around the actor’s neck, according to police.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” the Chicago Police Department said.

The actor and singer was reportedly in Chicago for a scheduled Saturday concert.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, who on the weekend launched her 2020 campaign to be America’s first black female president, called the incident “an attempted modern day lynching.”

“No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or colour of their skin. We must confront this hate,” Harris said on Twitter.

Members of the Empire production team and cast, as well as the studio that produces the programme, also spoke out.

“The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own,” 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.

The show’s co-creator Lee Daniels posted an Instagram video calling Jussie “my son.”

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” Daniels said, addressing the actor.

“Hold your head up Jussie. I’m with you. I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another f**king day in America,” he said.

Advocacy groups including the The Trevor Project and the American Civil Liberties Union, quickly offered their support as well.

“LGBTQ people of colour live at multiple intersections of oppression, too often facing violence compounded by both racism and homophobia,” the ACLU said.

“This isn’t the America we want to live in.” — AFP"

How a polar vortex links to climate change; the US steps up pressure to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

The planet is warming up, so it’s getting cold

The Midwest is about to get really, really cold. A polar vortex is expected to hit Tuesday through Thursday, with cities including Chicago likely to be as cold as minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit. [Vox / Brian Resnick]

About 90 million people will be exposed to temperatures below or at zero degrees in the coldest recorded forecast in generations. At least four national records for lowest temperature could be broken in states like Illinois and Iowa. [Washington Post / Angela Fritz]

What’s a polar vortex? Basically, the jet stream pushes a portion of the Arctic air that hangs above the North Pole down to North America. This may be due to a larger amount of warmer air at the pole displacing the colder air. [USA Today / Doyle Rice]

Climate change might explain why the North Pole is warmer than ever and this vortex is happening. If the polar climate continues to warm for a long time, colder air will keep streaming outside the Arctic. [NYT / Kendra Pierre-Louis]

Note to President Trump, who tweeted “what the hell is going on with global warming”: The phrase “global warming” doesn’t mean it can’t get cold anymore. 2018 was still the hottest year ever recorded — and a changing climate means changing weather. [Vox / Brian Resnick]

If you live in the Midwest, just stay inside if you can. Winds this cold actually displace the warm air the body naturally produces as armor against the cold, potentially causing frostbite within minutes. [Washington Post / Angela Fritz]

The US gives Guaidó more power to pressure Maduro

The US State Department today gave control of US bank accounts and property in Venezuela to National Assembly leader Juan Guaidó, whom the US recognized as the country’s legitimate leader last week. The State Department also issued a red-level travel warning for Americans traveling to Venezuela. [NYT / Edward Wong]

It’s the latest step the Trump administration has taken to support Guaidó: The administration announced on Monday that the US would place financial sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), in an effort to pressure President Nicolás Maduro to cede his power. This is basically an embargo on Venezuelan oil, and the US is its biggest client. [Vox / Alex Ward]

Giving Guaidó power over US property in Venezuela would allow him to sidestep Maduro’s strongholds in the economy and military — and it might be working. Venezuelan generals and diplomats have started to express support for Guaidó. [NYT / Edward Wong]

Maduro was mad at the US last week, but now he’s really upset that PDVSA, one of the country’s largest employers and revenue producers, has been slapped with $7 billion in blocked assets and $11 billion in frozen revenue. Guaidó established a new board of directors for PDVSA, making it even harder for Maduro to intervene. [NYMag / Jonah Shepp]

Some Democrats have disputed the sanctions. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said the US should be promoting democratic negotiations rather than rushing to prop up an opposition party. [Politico Magazine / Frida Ghitis]

Russia also isn’t happy — Venezuela has received billions of dollars in loans from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who claims Trump is just using sanctions to further US commercial interests. The sanctions could potentially delay Maduro’s regime from repaying Russia, causing tension in the region. [Washington Post / Anton Troianovski]

Correction: Monday’s edition of Sentences stated the Mariana dam accident in Brazil occurred in 2016 instead of 2015. Also, Brazil’s Brumadinho dam was actually deemed “stable” by inspectors prior to the incident last Friday. We regret the error.

The death toll from the dam collapse in Brumadinho, Brazil, has risen to 65. Today, five people were arrested in connection with the accident, including two engineers who worked for a company hired by Vale, the mining company that owns the dam. [WSJ / Jeffrey T. Lewis and Paulo Trevisani]

Malaysia Goodson was pushing the stroller with her daughter Rhylee, 12 months old, when she got to the steps at the 7th Avenue station at 53rd Street. The station, like many in New York City, does not have elevators or escalators, according to The New York Times.

Goodson picked up the stroller, began walking down the stairs, and tumbled onto the subway platform just before 8 p.m. The child survived the fall, but Goodson was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, called the death “a heartbreaking tragedy” and told The Times the agency would work with police to look into the incident.

About a quarter of the MTA’s 472 stations have elevators, and most are often out of order. One survey of subway elevator breakdowns found that, on average, each elevator breaks down 53 times a year, an average of once a week.

New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio tweeted about Goodson’s death and the lack of accessibility in Subway stations, and used the moment as a rallying call for the MTA to add more elevators to the city’s subways.

This is a heartbreaking tragedy that never should have happened. The subway system is not accessible for everyone and that’s an environment the MTA should not allow. https://t.co/X89fQep0LY — Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) January 29, 2019

A 2017 lawsuit filed against the transit authority described New York’s subway system as one of the least accessible in the country and accused the agency of violating the federal Americans With Disabilities Act.

By comparison, the subway systems in nearby Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. have far more working elevators and escalator than New York. The case, which was joined by the Justice Department in 2018, is still active, according to Disability Rights Advocates, which is representing the plaintiffs.

“The lack of accessibility in our subways is literally killing people,” New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson tweeted. “I am heartbroken by this tragedy, and am keeping this family in my thoughts. NYC must do more for families and the disabled.”

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him.""

Stars like John Legend, Danielle Brooks and Kerry Washington were among the public voices speaking out about the attack and the motives behind it, as were a number of journalists and activists.

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him.""

Stars like John Legend, Danielle Brooks and Kerry Washington were among the public voices speaking out about the attack and the motives behind it, as were a number of journalists and activists.

In a statement, the Chicago Police Department confirmed that they are investigating the incident as a “possible hate crime.”

After the assault, the New York City Anti-Violence Project released a statement emphasizing that “Jussie is not alone” in his experience. Gay Black men are among “some of the most vulnerable to violence in the LGBTQ community.”

And the data backs up NYCAVP’s statement. According to the latest numbers from the FBI, the number of hate crimes reported nationwide rose from 6,121 in 2016 to 7,175 in 2017. The most common types of hate crime incidents were based on the victim’s race (59.6%), religion (20.6%), and sexual orientation (15.8%). Of the 7,175 hate crimes reported, 7,106 were single-bias incidents while 69 were based on more than one bias.

The FBI defines a hate crime as a ""criminal offence against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.”

NYCAVP’s 2017 report on hate violence also showed a disturbing trend for LGBTQ people who experience violence. While the FBI’s hate crimes report comes from data culled from law enforcement agencies, NYCAVP’s report is comprised of data collected at nationwide anti-violence programs and LGBTQ people who report hate violence to the AVP.

AVP’s annual report cited a 20% decrease in reported hate violence, meaning that fewer people have reported their experiences to AVP, not that there were fewer hate-motivated crimes. In a statement to Out, AVP said that the “normalization of hate violence” could be behind the decrease in reporting.

“People may be less inclined to report less severe incidents as they become a regular occurrence,” the organization wrote. “That does not mean violence against LGBTQ people itself is lessening. On the contrary, in that same year we saw the highest amount of anti-LGBTQ hate movitated homicides in over twenty years of tracking hate violence against LGBTQ people.”

While the number of hate crimes reported to AVP has gone down, the crimes that were reported were more severe. In 2017, AVP recorded 52 hate violence related homicides, the highest number ever recorded in 21 years of data collection and an 86% increase from 2017. Of those victims, 71% were people of color, 52% were trans or gender nonconforming and 40% were trans women of color. The number of homicides of LGBTQ cisgender men increased 400% from 2016 (4 incidents) to 2017 (20 reported homicides).

The rates of violence crimes involving weapons, sustained injuries and requiring medical attention increased, as well. Forty-six percent of LGBTQ people who experienced hate violence sustained an injury (up from 31% in 2016), 42% sought medical attention (up from 23% in 2016) and 27% reported that their attackers used weapons (up from 13% in 2016).

While Smollett said he does not know his attackers, that is actually outside the norm for LGBTQ+ people who experience violence. According to NYCAVP, 57% of LGBTQ people who experience hate violence know the person who causes them harm, usually a co-worker (22%), a relative or family member (21%) or a landlord or neighbor (20%). Hate crimes most often happen in a person’s private residence (29%) or workplace (24%).

If you or someone you know has experienced harassment or assault, you can report it to AVP on its website or by calling (212) 714-1141.

486,https://pjmedia.com/instapundit/320182/,,NARRATOR VOICE: THEY ALREADY HAVE. Media Shouldn’t Make The Same Mistakes in Empire Actor Jussie S…,['Ed Driscoll'],,"['shouldnt', 'record', 'voice', 'jussie', 'actor', 'sensible', 'maga', 's', 'smollett', 'narrator', 'usually', 'statement', 'reason', 'mistakes', 'empire', 'reaction', 'media', 'happened']","NARRATOR VOICE: THEY ALREADY HAVE. Media Shouldn’t Make The Same Mistakes in Empire Actor Jussie Smollett Attack Stories As The Mistakes They Made With The Covington Kids.

Robby Soave at Reason posted a huge scoop on this developing story earlier today: “According to the victim, the offenders’ faces were concealed,” a police spokesperson told Reason. “We have no record indicating that [they shouted ‘MAGA’], we only have record of them shouting racial and homophobic slurs at him.” Chicago police have also released a statement contradicting claims that Smollett identified his attackers’ race and heard them shout “MAGA.” “We have no record of The MAGA Country comment,” said the police in a statement. “We have racial and homophobic comments documented.” Even without a MAGA shouting/white guys component to this story, what Smollett – who has reportedly already been discharged from the hospital – said happened to him is absolutely horrific. If the story is accurate, the perps should absolutely be punished to the fullest extent of the law. However, in the mad dash to get to the bottom of the allegations in order find out what happened and who committed the alleged acts, the national press needs to keep itself in check on this and have all their facts in order before rushing to social media to report on what they’ve found out.

Hence, the 48 Hour Rule: “So, the Covington Kerfuffle erupting over Saturday evening and Sunday morning initially earned one of those ‘meh’ reactions: another pearl-clutching media reaction over something simple and stupid, if not actually fraudulent… So – IAW (in accordance with) sensible practice, I deferred any interest, personal reaction or comment for at least 48 hours. The first reports about anything are usually wrong, misleading, inaccurate; SOMETHING has happened, and it usually takes at least that long for reporters to put out the fire in their hair and come up with some sensible reportage. Such was, I assumed (over considerable evidence to the contrary, gleaned through sad experience over the years) the common practice also among the more responsible news-gathering organizations. It seems that I am doomed to disappointment again, on this front.”

Not in the era of clickbait and Twitter, sadly. But then, the DNC-MSM has long described itself as “the first draft of history.” But as any writer can tell you, first drafts invariably suck. That’s why, in a more cautious era, they got edited, polished, and fact checked before publication."
