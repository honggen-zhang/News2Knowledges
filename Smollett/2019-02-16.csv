EST: Law enforcement sources are telling media that the Nigerian brothers arrested and later released in the alleged assault admitted Jussie Smollett paid them to orchestrate the attack.

———

As Chicago police continue to piece together what happened on the morning of Jan. 29, in which actor Jussie Smollett alleges he was the victim of a homophobic and racist assault, the star actor of ""Empire"" has lawyered up.



What are the details?

According to PageSix, Smollett has enlisted the legal aide of Michael Monico, a former federal prosecutor who represents Michael Cohen, the former personal lawyer of President Donald Trump.

PageSix has the details:

""Yes, at the moment, I am,"" Michael Monico, a former federal prosecutor in Illinois' Northern District, told WGN's ""The Roe Conn Show"" on Thursday.



Monico did not say how long he's been representing Smollett, or in what capacity.

The development generated traction on Saturday after police released two ""persons of interest"" in the assault case just hours after they were apprehended. The potential suspects — Nigerian brothers Olabinjo Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola Osundairo, 25 — were released after new evidence surfaced, a police spokesman said.

What is the new evidence?

First, the Chicago Police Department confirmed the brothers were the two men seen on surveillance images at the alleged crime scene.

""Yes, they are confirmed to be the men on scene by surveillance video. The reason why they were there is now central to the investigation and we can't get into that at this time,"" CPD told WLS-TV.

A lawyer representing the brothers said something her clients told investigators shifted the trajectory of the investigation, although she did not go into detail, according to TMZ.

Second, a reporter for WFLD-TV — Fox's local Chicago affiliate — reported Saturday that police are now seriously investigating whether the alleged assault is, in fact, a hoax after it was discovered the Osundairo brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a local Ace Hardware store.

Finally, CPD told multiple reporters that after speaking with the Osundairo brothers Friday night, detectives reached out to Smollett's legal team explaining they need to speak with Smollett again.

CNN later reported Saturday, citing law enforcement sources, that new evidence suggests Smollett orchestrated the attack."

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

“The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement late Friday.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on “Empire,” Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man’s job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

But police earlier this week said there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation."

Smollett denies playing a role in his attack, according to a statement from his attorneys.

The men, who are brothers, were arrested Wednesday but released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of ""new evidence.""

The sources told CNN the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs."" He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

The sources told CNN there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a hardware store in Chicago.

Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement to CNN Saturday night saying Smollett was angry about these latest developments.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Smollett's attorneys said they expect further updates from Chicago police on the investigation and will continue cooperating with authorities.

""At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels,"" the statement read.

Smollett identifies as gay and since 2015 has played the gay character of Jamal on the Fox TV drama ""Empire.""

What happened

According to Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, the actor told detectives he was attacked by two men near the lower entrance of a Loews hotel in Chicago. Police were told the two men yelled ""'Empire' fa***t"" and ""'Empire' n***er'"" while striking him.

In a supplemental interview with authorities, Smollett confirmed media reports that one of the attackers also shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

The day after the incident, police released surveillance images that showed two silhouetted individuals walking down a sidewalk, and police said they were wanted for questioning.

The two men were arrested Wednesday. Police on Friday said the men were being viewed as ""potential suspects"" and that detectives had ""probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.""

But by Friday night they had been released , Guglielmi said, ""due to new evidence as a result of today's investigations.""

""And detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" he added.

One of the men has appeared on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. A police source also told CNN on Friday night that the men had a previous affiliation with Smollett, but did not provide additional details.

Smollett has expressed frustration about not being believed

Following the alleged attack, Smollett's colleagues and fans rallied around him, expressing shock and sadness.

""We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows that we are united on a united front,"" Lee Daniels, the creator of ""Empire,"" said in a video posted to his Instagram page on January 29. ""And no racist f*** can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up, Jussie. I'm with you.""

Smollett gave his first detailed account of what he says was a hate crime against him, and the aftermath, in an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that aired Thursday.

During the interview he expressed frustration at not being believed.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" Smollett said. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.""

Smollett stated that one of the attackers shouted ""this is MAGA country"" before punching him in the face. But he refuted reports that said he told police the attackers wore ""Make America Great Again"" hats.

""I never said that,"" he told ABC's Robin Roberts. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae."""

ABC News(CHICAGO) — When news broke of the alleged racist attack on a star from one of the most popular shows on television, it riveted everyone, drawing the nation into a heated discussion about race, politics and celebrity. But as the investigation continued, growing skepticism about Smollett’s story added enormous pressure on Chicago investigators to get to the bottom of what really happened that night. Here is a timeline of the Jussie Smollett case as it unfolded over the past several weeks.

Jan. 22: Smollett reports to police receiving a threatening letter sent to the Fox studio where ‘Empire’ is filmed, containing threatening language and laced with a powdery substance investigators believe was likely crushed-up Tylenol.

Jan. 29: Smollett is allegedly attacked at 2 a.m. near his apartment in Chicago. Two masked assailants poured ‘an unknown chemical substance’ on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, he told police. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett alleges that the attackers yelled “MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan.

Jan. 30: Chicago police announce in a tweet that they are seeking two “persons of interest” who were captured on surveillance video near the scene and around the time of the alleged attack.

Jan. 31: Smollett’s family releases and emotional statement describing the alleged attack as a hate crime. “In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,” the family wrote in the statement to ABC News. “Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

Feb. 1: Smollett releases a new statement thanking his fans and reiterating that his account of the alleged attack has remained consistent. “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in the statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Feb. 2: Smollett makes his first appearance on stage since the alleged attack, performing at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. “Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,” Jussie Smollett said, tearing up before beginning his set. “We hope that you all stand with us.”

Feb. 4: Chicago police release the initial incident report about the alleged attack on Smollett. The report reveals that Smollett was apparently reluctant to report the attack, and that when police arrived at his home to interview him, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The report states that a 60-year-old friend of Smollett called the police on his behalf and said the actor “did not want to report offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.”

Smollett said the attack happened at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant. He told police that two attackers gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs and began to beat him “about the face with their hands,” the report said. “The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black,” according to the report. “The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled,” it added.

Ten days passed without any developments in the investigation into the alleged attack, prompting growing skepticism about Smollett’s account on social media.

Feb. 13: Unbeknownst to the public, Chicago police investigators had been “tracking the two ‘persons of interest’ and were aware of who they were “for awhile,” a law enforcement source subsequently told ABC News. Investigators learned that these two individuals were returning to Chicago on Feb. 13 from Nigeria and moved in. The pair were detained at the airport, placed under arrest and taken in for questioning.

Feb. 14: In an exclusive interview with “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts, Smollett said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story. He defended himself against skeptics who pointed out that it wasn’t until a follow-up interview with the police that he mentioned that the assailants were wearing red “MAGA” hats.

“For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,” Smollett said. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—-, they called me a n—-. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

The same day, Smollett is re-interviewed by Chicago police investigators. By evening, police sources confirm that they obtained search warrants and raided the homes of the two individuals, recovering bleach, shoes, electronics and other items.

Feb. 15: Chicago police announce that they have identified and are questioning the two “persons of interest” captured on a surveillance video.

By midday, a CPD spokesman tells ABC News that the two ‘persons of interest’ are, in fact, under arrest, and acknowledge that the pair has “a relationship with” Smollett. In an unusual move for an ongoing investigation, police officials who had originally described the two as ‘persons of interest’ begin describing the two men as “potential suspects.” But by late that evening, investigators changed course, and announced that the two men have been released without charges.

Feb. 16: Chicago police identify the two men they arrested and later releases as brothers — Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo — both U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent.

Something that caught my attention during the whole drama over his alleged attack by red hat-wearing, MAGA yelling attackers is that he deleted a strongly worded tweet to President Trump from his Twitter feed as this story gained steam in the press. Why did our brave victim do that? I haven’t seen any reference to the tweet in any of the reporting of the story.

The tweet called Trump a ‘nigga’ and that was pretty much the only thing that set it apart from any other Trump deranged tweet from a Hollywood celebrity. Having seen that tweet, I was skeptical of his story about the alleged attack from the start. I just couldn’t figure out why he would do it. Here’s one tweet that is still up and it refers to Trump supporters as “white-hooded cohorts” and clowns. Of course, he’s speaking in support of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

.@AOC is only speaking facts. This is so far beyond political party affiliation.

The news today is that the two Nigerian men brought in for questioning by Chicago police have now been released. The police released them “due to new evidence.”

In a bit of irony, it is being reported that Smollett has hired a lawyer who represented convicted felon and former Trump fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen. Small world, huh?

The release of Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo at near 9 PM Chicago time surely means that whatever that “new evidence” is, it is a clear game changer for the ever twisting and turning Empire star case. Adding to that, attorney Michael Monico has been now been retained by Smollett. The Chicago-based defense lawyer is a frequent go-to-guy for high profile cases. In the past year he represented Donald Trump’s ex-right hand man Michael Cohen in his dealings with Robert Mueller’s investigation and other related federal cases. Having seemingly spilled the beans to the ex-FBI Director to some extent or another on his lying to Congress and more, Cohen is set to start a three-year prison sentence next month.

Looks like attorney Monico is experienced with clients telling tall tales. I wonder what beans the Nigerians spilled to warrant their release without being charged with anything. Due to yesterday’s tragic mass shooting in nearby Aurora, CPD canceled a press conference to update on the story.

We will eventually get the full story, I assume, but meanwhile, it is puzzling why this guy would put himself in this public relations mess. I didn’t understand why a celebrity would be walking alone down a deserted Chicago street at 2:00 A.M. during a polar vortex to get a sandwich at a nearby Subway. Magically, two men appeared and jumped him on his return walk back to his apartment. They just happened to have bleach and a noose on them. None of it made sense from the beginning. Allegedly, one of the Nigerian men has worked on the Empire show.

The two men — whom police have identified only as Nigerian brothers — were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday and taken into custody after returning from Nigeria after police learned that at least one of the men worked on “Empire,” according to police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. He said he did not know what the man’s job was on the television drama. Guglielmi’s comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed. Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

I watch Empire and Smollett does a good job with the character he plays. I hadn’t read rumors that his character was being written out of the show. As I said, I was skeptical from the beginning. He’s openly gay so maybe it was a date or social arrangement gone bad. The kidnapping speculation about the Nigerians didn’t make sense to me, either. Smollett claimed during an interview on an early morning show this week that the men in the video released by police looked like the men who attacked him, though in the video they were covered up with heavy coats and their faces weren’t clearly seen. This story has hoax written all over it, if you ask me. He’s politically active (especially during Obama’s administration) and this seems to be a slap at Trump supporters that backfired.

Trump Derangement Syndrome is real and it is prevalent among the Hollywood crowd. It seems to me that a better way to criticize President Trump would be to take him on over policy rather than to go after his supporters. Perhaps the actor should put down the scripts written for him and pick up a policy paper or two. In real life, a bogus story by a high profile actor will be a story that lingers."

In an interview with reporters Friday night in Chicago, attorney Gloria Schmidt was asked if she could shed any new light on the evidence police cited. Schmidt said it was ""new evidence that was brought to their attention... obviously I had it, my clients had it, but I think it took a matter of coordination.""

The two men, who both worked on Empire, were arrested Friday morning but were never charged. Police said the two were released after questioning. They are no longer considered suspects and the investigation continues.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

Smollett, 36, told police he was attacked by two men in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 on his way to his apartment. He said the men yelled homophobic and racial slurs at him, poured a chemical on him and put a rope around his neck.

The Osundairo brothers were met by police at O'Hare International Airport, after arriving in Chicago from Nigeria in Wednesday. Police also raided their homes.

Although sources close to the investigation have told local Chicago media outlets the attack may have been a hoax, police insist there is no evidence to suggest that. When TMZ asked Schmidt if it was a hoax, she did not speculate.

""There's so many moving parts to this,"" Schmidt said. ""That will come out in due time. I don't want to speculate. I think I would be doing a disservice to the truth if I did.""

Schmidt also said her clients have a story to tell ""when the time is right"" and would not answer why they went to Nigeria on the day of the alleged attack.

Other reports suggested that Smollett planned the attack because he was going to be written off Empire, but show producer 20th Century FOX Television denied that.

""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" the studio said.

On Thursday, Smollett gave his first televised interview since the alleged attack, telling Good Morning America he hopes to see the surveillance video released.

“I want them to see that I fought back and I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the [expletive] back. And it does not take anything away from people that are not able to do that but I fought back,"" Smollett, an openly gay actor, said. ""They ran off. I didn't.""

Late Friday night, Chicago defense attorney Michael Monico said he is now representing Smollett. Moncino is a former federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Illinois and represented President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.

“Yes, at the moment, I am,” Monico replied.

Smollett’s rep denied the report when contacted by TheWrap on Saturday, and Monico declined to comment on the matter.

According to Breitbart, Monico and his law partner, Barry Spevack, took over as Cohen’s attorney, his press representative Lanny Davis said on Jan. 28. Monico and Spevack took over for Guy Petrillo, a criminal defense attorney who previously served as the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office’s criminal division chief.

Smollett told detectives he was attacked near his Chicago home by two men on Jan. 29 yelling about “MAGA,” as well as spewing racist and homophobic slurs. According to a police statement, the actor reported that he was battered “about the face,” that “an unknown chemical substance” was poured on him, and that the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck.

Two males were arrested and questioned as “potential suspects” then released without charges “due to new evidence” on Friday.

Police have said that Smollett continues to be considered a victim in relation to the investigation, contesting two recent news reports saying investigators have raised the possibility that Smollett may have orchestrated the attack himself.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” Chicago police tweeted Thursday. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”"

As CrimeOnline has previously reported, the star of “Empire” claimed last month that he was the victim of an apparent hate crime outside of a Chicago Subway restaurant.

In the weeks since, police have investigated his claims and earlier this week arrested two brothers identified as Nigerians who had roles as extras on the same television series.

Rumors swirled that they were involved, perhaps along with Smollett, in staging the incident. But Chicago police shot down such allegations, stating there was no evidence the attack was a hoax and that Smollett was being treated as a victim, not a suspect.

Michael Monico, a former Illinois prosecutor now working as a criminal defense attorney, acknowledged in a radio interview this week that he is representing the actor, as reported by Page Six.

“Yes, at the moment I am,” he said without adding any details regarding the scope of his representation or how long Smollett has been a client.

The brothers arrested in connection with the case — later identified as Ola Osundairo and Abel Osundairo — were subsequently released without charge after police reportedly removed items including a mask and bleach from their home.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging,” said Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi in a media statement on Friday. “Detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

CHICAGO — Police said Saturday the investigation into the attack reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers investigated in the case, and police want to interview the “Empire” actor again.

Police released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the reported attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case. A spokeswoman for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Multiple outlets, including CNN, reported Saturday that investigators in the case, which was initially being explored as a possible hate crime, now believe that Smollett organized the incident.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked early Jan. 29 in Chicago by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett said he is cooperating with police and gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood on Feb. 2, saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

Earlier last week, police said media reports that the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

What a scary ordeal.

During Friday night’s performance of Lin-Manuel Miranda‘s Hamilton at the Orpheum Theatre in San Fransisco, mass panic erupted after an audience member had a medical emergency and it was mistaken for an active shooter.

According to the San Francisco Fire Department, a woman suffered a heart attack at 9:51 p.m PST. In order to save her life, a defibrillator was pulled off a wall at the theater which triggered a fire alarm. She was taken to the hospital in critical condition.

The chaos from the alarm caused “an unorganized rapid exit of the theater,” which lead to multiple injuries including a broken leg and other moderate damage from the stampede.

Here’s the official word from first responders:

***BREAKING*** 1/3 At 2151 HRs An adult had a medical emergency at the Orpheum Theater An AED was pulled which also triggered an alarm during the Hamilton Play. This resulted is confusion, and an un-organized rapid exit of the theater. During this process, 3 additional adults – — SAN FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT (@SFFDPIO) February 16, 2019

***BREAKING 2/3*** were injured, one with a broken leg, and 2 with moderate injuries. @SFPD AND @SFFDPIO responded and confirmed that the incident was not an intentional act, and started the mitigation process.

And here are visuals during the situation and some video from the aftermath of the chaos:

Considering another deadly mass shooting took place earlier Friday in Aurora, these audience members knew nothing but to panic. We’re just glad everyone ended up ok, and hope the woman who suffered the heart attack makes a complete recovery.

The two men who were arrested by Chicago Police earlier this week in regards to the “Empire” actor‘s alleged attack have now been released without charges. Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Communications Officer for Chicago Police, took to Twitter on Friday night to share the update.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the ‘Empire’ case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the statement reads. The news comes hours after Guglielmi announced there would be no press conference about the case.

Chicago Police confirmed to ET on Friday morning that the two men who have been questioned by police since earlier this week were arrested Wednesday night. A spokesperson for Chicago Police confirmed to ET that it was the same two individuals who were captured on surveillance video around the same time as the alleged attack on the “Empire” star in the early morning hours of Jan. 29. Police have yet to release the names of these men.

“Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney. While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim [Smollett] is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi told ET earlier in the day. “For clarification, the two individuals interviewed are classified as potential suspects. Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.”

Meanwhile, ET has confirmed that Smollett has hired high-powered Chicago criminal defence attorney Michael Monico, who is now representing the star.

Monico is best known as one of the defence attorneys representing President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and alleged “fixer” Michael Cohen; no reason was provided as to why Smollett, the victim of the alleged attack, would require the services of a criminal defence lawyer.

High-profile #Chicago defense attorney Michael Monico let it be known he was representing #JussieSmollett on @RoeConn radio show today. Monico also represents #MichaelCohen. He's considered one of the best defense lawyers in the country. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 16, 2019

On Thursday, police once again questioned Smollett, as well as raided the home of the two aforementioned men.

Local Chicago media reports claim that Smollett is being investigated for potentially orchestrating his own attack.

There were also reports earlier this week that the actor might have staged the attack, thinking he might have been being written off “Empire”. However, the network and studio released a statement to ET denying Smollett’s character was being dropped from the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” the joint statement read. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

This all comes after Smollett made his first television appearance since the attack, appearing on “Good Morning America” to tearfully recount the incident.

Here’s what we now know. Those two musclebound Nigerian brothers, Abimbola ‘Abel’ Osundairo & Olabinjo ‘Ola’ Osundairo, that were questioned and released by Chicago police for the alleged attack on Smollett, ARE the two men seen in the grainy surveillance video the actor. Remember, the “Empire” actor has said that those men are without a doubt the ones who allegedly assaulted him.

OK, got that? Keep that in mind as you read this quote:

“Yes, they are confirmed to be the men on scene by surveillance video,” Chicago Police said in a statement to ABC7 Chicago. “The reason why they were there is now central to the investigation and we can’t get into that at this time.”

Smollett said Thursday he was certain the two grainy figures captured on camera were his assailants.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did,” he declared on “Good Morning America.”

The Osundairo brothers were taken in for questioning Friday in connection with the alleged racist, homophobic attack on Smollett. But they were released from police custody later that night.

There’s also this via TMZ: “Empire” cast and crew members said there’s no way the Nigerian brothers are at fault because they were not homophobic, racist or pro-Trump.

The development is the latest twist in a story that has grown weirder by the day since Jan. 29, when the alleged attack took place.

Smollett, who is openly gay, told cops he was attacked around 2 a.m. by masked men who yelled homophobic slurs, put a rope around his neck and yelled “This is MAGA country!”

The alleged beatdown has spawned multiple conspiracy theories, including that it was a figment of the actor’s imagination, dreamed up to save him from being written off the show."

‘People of Interest’ in Jussie Smollett Case Released by Chicago Police

Chicago Police Department released the two men held for questioning in the “Empire” case without charges on Friday, Feb. 15, because of “new evidence.”

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi stated in a Twitter post.

The authorities didn’t elaborate on the new evidence.

The men who were questioned are brothers from Nigeria named Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo who describe themselves online as actors and models, according to TMZ.

The Nigerian brothers were picked up by the police at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport after they returned from Nigeria.

Guglielmi described them as “people of interest” and said they’re not considered as suspects.

“The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported. They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim,” he said in an earlier statement.

“Empire” TV series actor Jussie Smollett, who is black and openly gay, alleged that he was attacked by two men on Jan. 29, after buying a sandwich from Subway and on his way home to his apartment.

He also said that the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country” in the late-night incident, apparently in reference to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”

During an interview on ABC news, Smollett said that he doesn’t know the eye color of the alleged attackers.

“I can’t tell you what the color their eyes were,” he said.

“It’s Chicago in winter, people can wear ski masks and nobody’s gonna question that,” Smollett added.

He also alleged his two attackers shouted homophobic and racial slurs at him last month before wrapping a rope around his neck.

According to the Chicago Tribune, the authorities haven’t found any video showing the alleged attack.

In the interview with ABC News, Smollett said that “I respect too much the people who—I am now one of those people—who have been attacked in any way. You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.”

Some news outlets have reported that the attack was possibly staged with help from the two brothers. But police said they have no evidence to support the hoax speculation and issued a rebuttal in a Feb. 14 statement.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,” Guglielmi said.

He reaffirmed that media reports of investigative details cannot be confirmed at this time.

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

“(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he told the network. “Never did.”

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing .

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were “ridiculous” to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation .

ABC News(CHICAGO) — After interrogating and releasing two men seen in surveillance video near the scene of the alleged attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, Chicago police are saying that the new information they have “could change the story entirely.”

The two men, confirmed by police as those seen in surveillance images from the night of the alleged incident, were arrested on Wednesday night and interviewed by detectives in the following days.

Initially, the two men were considered potential suspects because they admitted to police that they were at the scene, that they were the men in the images and because police had probable cause they could be the attackers. Based on the video evidence that police discovered, it did not indicate anyone else was there at the scene of the alleged incident, police say.

But on Saturday, after their release the night before, police were only considering them to be persons of interest, saying that they may still have information that is helpful to the investigation.

In the early morning hours of Jan. 29, Smollett reported that he was walking outside when he was attacked by two men. The attackers shouted racist and homophobic slurs before hitting him, pouring “an unknown chemical substance” on him — possibly bleach — and wrapping a rope around his neck, he told detectives.

Police confirmed phone records show that during the attack, Smollett was on the phone with Brandon Moore, his music manager. Both claim that the alleged attackers yelled “MAGA country.”

While police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Saturday that he could not speak on what the new information was, he said that the break from detectives has “shifted the trajectory” of the investigation. Though he did not say whether Smollett spoke to the men that night — one of them had previously appeared on “Empire” — he said it will also be central to the investigation whether they spoke to or saw Smollett.

Police raided the home of the two men on Wednesday night to search for possible evidence and retrieved shoes, electronic devices, bleach and a red hat, among other items, according to photos of an inventory log confirmed to ABC News. The inventory log, first reported by a local CBS station, also contained a description for an item saying “Script-Empire.”

It’s unclear whether forensic results have come back on any of the seized items on the inventory log.

Police could not confirm that the two men, U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent, are brothers, but told ABC News that they believed as much. They also said that the two “have a relationship with [Jussie].”

They did not name the men, saying they’re not doing so because they weren’t being criminally charged.

On Friday, as interviews with the two men continued, Guglielmi said that “the alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.” He also said that there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax.”

CHICAGO — Chicago police released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting Empire actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

“The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement late Friday.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on Empire, Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man’s job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

The authorities are said to have found “new evidence” exonerating Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, who themselves worked as extras on the Fox TV series, and allegedly shared personable rapports with Smollett.

The case of Smollett’s attack has taken several bizarre turns since its initial occurrence in late January. An interview with G.M.A.’s Robin Roberts saw Smollett clarifying details of the incident, including false reports that he’d described his attackers as wearing “Make America Great Again” hats. Speculation even emerged that Smollett had staged the attack to benefit his career, though Chicago police said there was “no evidence” of any subterfuge.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were booked for battery and interrogated as persons of interest this week, and TMZ reports a raid of their home turned up several bottles of bleach (it was said Smollett’s attackers had poured a chemical substance on him during the scuffle). It was not clear if the Osundairo brothers were believed to be the same men in a surveillance photo Smollett acknowledged to be of the assailants.

A separate TMZ report also alleges that Ola and Abel Osundairo were generally well liked by the Empire cast and crew, and have expressed political and social views far removed from the racist and homophobic language described in the initial attack. It is also said that Smollett would discuss health and fitness with the brothers on set, leaving it unclear what first pointed the investigation in their direction. It is also uncertain what “new evidence” precipitated their release, though police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement on Friday that “detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

Abel and Ola Osundairo reportedly flew from the U.S. to Nigeria the day of the incident and were arrested upon their Wednesday return to O’Hare International Airport. Asked about the trip, the brothers’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, stated it was a “great question,” and that the brothers would share their story “when the time is right.”

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” Schmidt told CBS News of the brothers. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”"

Conservatives immediately called BS on this yarn, and it looks like they are being proven correct.

It wasn’t MAGA lovers who attacked Smollett with the prime suspects being Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, two Nigerian gentlemen who look like they hit the gym from time to time. The Chicago Sun Times reports on what looks to be another fake hate crime:

“Chicago police are investigating the possibility that the reported attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett was staged as they question two people including an actor connected with the show, a law enforcement source said Thursday.

Detectives believe the men, both of whom are black, are the same people shown in a surveillance image released by police days after the purported attack, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Detectives were able to trace their location through ride-hailing and taxi records from the area where Smollett said the attack happened, according to a law enforcement source. Police have video from a doorbell camera among other images of the men, who were picked up at O’Hare Airport, the source said.

Officers have searched a North Side home where at least one of the “persons of interest” lives and recovered personal effects including cell phones, a source said. On Thursday night, no one answered the door at the home when a reporter rang the doorbell. The door appeared to have been damaged and left slightly open.

A neighbor said she saw law enforcement officials inside the home Wednesday evening, starting around 8 p.m.

They stayed “well past midnight,” said the neighbor, who asked not to be named. The woman said she would be surprised if her neighbors were involved in the incident involving Smollett.

An attorney for the men, who reportedly just returned from Nigeria, said they do know him.”

Since Donald J. Trump’s election, liberals have staged hundreds if not thousands of phony hate crimes that are amplified by the mainstream media. This is one of myriad ways in which they intend to manipulate public opinion to steal the election and take the country back to socialism and despair in 2020.

This human trash of the left is a plague upon our society, and this plague is aided and abetted not only by the mass media but also by institutional actors within the federal government. Smollet is a particularly boneheaded example of this plague. He almost certainly made up a story that a five-year-old boy would make up. His low IQ blunder puts a spotlight on the hate hoax industry that has gone into full effect since Trump’s election.

Don’t expect any apologies from the left for this deception. Instead, these lowlifes will just rush head-long into their next con. Trump may have to suspend democracy in order to physically remove the human garbage from the body politic if he truly wants America to be great again."

We respectively request that the civil suit against Nathan Phillips for lying about the Covington Catholic High School students be dropped due to the fact that he was acting under the influence of Trump Derangement Syndrome.

Dilbert creator Scott Adams brought up an interesting thesis in a Tweet on Friday about whether Trump Derangement Syndrome could be used as a legal defense in the future for people who acted criminally or immorally.

How long before we see Trump Derangement Syndrome used as a legal defense? ""Your honor, my client was brainwashed by the media into believing the fate of the Republic was at stake."" Science would back that defense. It's a real thing. https://t.co/CUxxcppkob — Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) February 15, 2019

That reference to the ""fate of the Republic"" could obviously refer to former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe who stated (but later denied) that he discussed with DOJ officials the possibility of removing President Donald Trump from office via the 25th Amendment despite the fact you can't use that amendment to remove a president just because you don't like him. Adams went into more detail about using Trump Derangement Syndrome as a legal defense in this video. He also specifically discussed TDS sufferer McCabe.

At what point will Trump Derangement Syndrome be a legitimate legal defense? And it's a more interesting question than you think because the the entire legal system depends on the illusion of free will. ...So we live in a world where it feels like you make your own decisions but science keeps chipping away at that and I would say that it would be easy to get an expert, a psychologist, a scientist, a brain expert to confirm that people are being brainwashed by their choice of media.

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I humbly request that you find my client not guilty due to the fact that he watched too much CNN which caused him to get mixed up about the apples and made him go TDS bananas!

And now Adams brings up the possibility that McCabe was brainwashed by his TDS to believe that the 25th Amendment could actually be used for a situation for which it was not intended.

I'm pretty sure that you could prove that, let's say McCabe, and this is just, you know hypothetical none of this is going to happen, but I think you could get scientists to say that McCabe was literally brainwashed to believe that there was a crisis and the Constitution and that something had to be done immediately to save the country. So but would that be a legal defense? Well at them at the moment it would not. You know it might have some effect on sentencing but you couldn't legally get away with that defense.

Your honor, although my client is obviously guilty of being so completely stupid as to think the 25th Amendment could be used to remove a President for no other reason than he just didn't approve of him, I respectfully request that his sentence be reduced due to fact that he was a brainwashed TDS victim.

Adams also cites CNN's Chris Cillizza presenting two contrasting ways of looking at what McCabe claimed to have done regarding the removal of Trump from office which makes me wonder if the Dilbert creator is a reader of Newsbusters since your humble correspondent wrote an article about this same topic on Friday.

There was a piece by Chris Cillizza who is a notable anti-Trumper and I want to just read to you a little bit from him today if I can find it. ...He talked about the news of what McCabe said about the 25th Amendment. He said there are two ways to look at it. One of those ways is that there's a deep state and they were literally talking about a coup using the 25th Amendment to replace the government. So he says that's one way to look at it. Sort of the two movies on one screen idea in his own words. So one way is that it was exactly what a lot of you think. They were talking about a coup but here's the other way. So this is Chris Cillizza, anti-Trumper, telling you the other thing that this evidence could suggest. He says this news from McCabe is confirmation so this is, if you're a Trump opponent you might think this in his framing. This news for McCabe is confirmation that senior officials within the Justice Department were so worried about Trump's behavior in office that they broached the unthinkable: removal by means of the Constitution. The fact that such serious and professional people men and women charged with enforcing the laws of the country were driven to such extreme action or at least the contemplation of such extreme action proves just how abnormal and dangerous Trump really is both to the presidency and the country. Now this is sort of what I was explaining yesterday, the idea that in McCabe's mind he might have been a patriot but only in his mind. Not in your mind obviously. But in his mind he might have thought, ""Oh my God! I'm the last defense against Russia running the country!"" and so he had to act on that.

Yup, that certainly rings true. Extreme TDS suffered by not only by McCabe but by millions of others including almost all of the mainstream media.

But the way Cillizza frames this is hilarious because it's framed as though there are two possibilities, there are two ways to describe what's happening. One is that it was a deep state plot to overthrow the country or overthrow the government using the 25th Amendment. The second is the President was so sketchy and there were there's so many reasons to think there was something wrong that even if McCabe was incorrect he was operating in good faith against these obvious indications that there was some gigantic problem potentially. ...What's left out is the more obvious option is that CNN and the mainstream media...has illegitimately brainwashed a huge segment of the country into something like Trump Derangement Syndrome. Now that to me is by far the most accurate description of what's probably happening here. I think what's probably happening is that the media got McCabe and other people so whipped up into thinking that something dangerous was happening that ordinary evidence that would not normally climb to the level of discussing the 25th Amendment certainly seemed attenuated.

Your honor, may I place into evidence the statement by Scott Adams that my client acted so absurdly due to his TDS brainwashing by the mainstream media?

p.s. Hello Scott Adams wherever you are!"

Feb. 16 (UPI) -- Chicago police said they released two men they arrested on suspicion of attacking Empire actor Jussie Smollett amid new evidence in the investigation.

Authorities considered the two men ""persons of interest"" and detained them Wednesday night at Chicago O'Hare Airport. They released the men Friday night.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said they released the men after detectives discovered new evidence upon their interrogation.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Guglielmi said in a tweet Friday evening.

Gloria Schmidt, an attorney representing the two men, who are brothers, said for her clients, ""justice prevailed.""

""My guys are walking home,"" Schmidt added. ""They are not charged. They are not suspects in this case.''

Smollett, 35, was hospitalized Jan. 29 after he said two unknown men in Chicago attacked him while he was walking and shouted racial and homophobic slurs, police said.

The actor told police the offenders poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene."

Jussie Smollett has hired Michael Cohen’s criminal defense lawyer, the attorney confirmed this week, amid the deepening mystery of the “Empire” actor’s claim that he was the victim of a hate attack.

“Yes, at the moment, I am,” Michael Monico, a former federal prosecutor in Illinois’ Northern District, told WGN’s “The Roe Conn Show” on Thursday.

Monico did not say how long he’s been representing Smollett, or in what capacity.

Cohen, President Trump’s former personal attorney, hired Monico to his defense team last month to represent him as he faces federal charges that he violated campaign finance laws and lied to Congress.

The openly gay actor claims he was ambushed on Jan. 29 as he was walking home through Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood. He says his masked assailants tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him and yelled homophobic slurs and “MAGA country!”

Police arrested two “Empire” extras, brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, in connection with the alleged assault Friday, but released them later in the day. Cops also raided their Chicago-area apartment and confiscated bleach and a black face mask.

Police confirmed Saturday the brothers were present at the scene of the attack and provided new evidence that “is now central to the investigation,” without providing details."

It’s unclear at what point Monico began to represent Smollett, but Monico, revealed in a radio interview on Thursday in Chicago that he is representing Smollett, according to the Daily Mail.

As we reported, police in Chicago arrested two Nigerian men who had previously been described as suspects in the attack. However they were later released after ‘new evidence’ had emerged in their interrogations that now requires further detective work.

Smollett states during his recent interview that the men who attacked him were white. It is unclear what led police to the brothers Olabinjo ‘Ola’ Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola ‘Abel’ Osundairo, 25 after Smollett conformed his attacker’s description.

The Osundairo brothers’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt even spoke out to reporters to the latest updates on her clients and what she thinks about the case,

“There’s so many moving parts to this that will come out in time,’ Schmidt said when asked if her clients had helped Smollett stage the attack. ‘I’m going to let them tell their story when the time is right.”

The two men in surveillance video who Jussie Smollett insisted on national TV were the racist fiends who attacked him, are actually his gym buddies — the pair of muscle-bound Nigerian brothers questioned and released without charges in connection with the increasingly bizarre case, Chicago police told The Post on Saturday.

“The two suspects released yesterday were in fact on the scene and in the surveillance image,” said Chicago police spokeswoman Jessica Rocco, referring to the brawny bros, models/actors Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo.

The workout warriors, who were arrested Wednesday at Chicago O’Hare Airport as they returned from their native country, were initially characterized as “persons of interest,” in the case, but were released Friday — when cops said they have new evidence to investigate.

“Information received from the brothers during the interview process have in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago PD spokeswoman Christine Calace said, without offering more details.

The 36-year-old “Empire” actor, who is gay, declared Thursday on “Good Morning America” that he was certain the two grainy figures seen in footage are the masked thugs he claimed beat him up on Jan. 29 outside a Subway restaurant in Chicago, hurling homophobic and racist slurs at him as they pounded his body.

“This is MAGA country!” the men said as the looped a rope around his neck, the actor claimed. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did,” he declared.

He also said they were likely white.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” said Smollett.

The brothers, it turns out, have a “relationship” with Smollett, authorities said, and worked on the smash Fox drama. They also pumped iron with Smollett at the gym, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, has said. And the actor is among the brothers’ Instagram followers.

On Saturday, “Empire” cast and crew members jumped to the brothers’ defense, saying there’s no way they could have attacked Smollett, because they’re not homophobic or racist, TMZ reported. Smollett would regularly approach them to talk health and fitness, the unnamed staffers told the outlet.

Reports surfaced Thursday that cops were investigating claims Smollett and the attack was staged to keep him from being written off the show — a theory the actor and Fox Television executives have denied.

“At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth,” Smollett said on GMA.

Meanwhile, it has also emerged that Michael Monico, Michael Cohen’s high-powered defense attorney, is now representing Smollett.

“Yes, at the moment, I am,” Monico, told WGN’s “The Roe Conn Show” Thursday. He did not say how long, or in what capacity.

Monico, a former federal prosecutor in Illinois’ Northern District, did not return messages seeking comment.

Schmidt could not immediately be reached, but assured TMZ that the whole story would emerge.

“There’s so many moving parts to this,” she said. “That will come out in due time. I don’t want to speculate. I think I would be doing a disservice to the truth if I did.”"

In an update, shared on Twitter by Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi, the police department revealed that ""new evidence"" came about after an interrogation with the two suspects that led to their released. Guglielmi said ""detectives have additional investigative work to complete."" He did not share any more details about the case.

The department confirmed to ET Online on Friday that the suspects were questioned by police, starting early this week. They were arrested on Wednesday night. A spokesperson for the Chicago Police confirmed that it was the same two individuals seen in surveillance footage shot around the time of the attack on Jan. 29. Police have not yet released the names of the suspects.

""Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney. While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim [Smollett] is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,"" Guglielmi said at the time. ""For clarification, the two individuals interviewed are classified as potential suspects. Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.""

On Thursday, police revealed they questioned Smollett and raided the home of the two suspects. Around that time, rumors began swirling that the actor knew his attacker and orchestrated the incident in response to allegedly being written off Empire. The network released a statement refuting that claim, telling fans Smollett was not cut from the show.

""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,"" the statement read. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

The new evidence, as well as rumors surrounding the case, come after Smollett did a TV interview with Good Morning America recounting the attack."

Outsiders should regard purported hate crimes that sound like crafted narratives with skepticism until they're proven true.

‘Jussie Smollett, one of the stars of the television show ‘Empire,’ was attacked in Chicago by 2 assailants who yelled racial and homophobic slurs,” tweeted the New York Times on January 29.

Mark the tone of absolute certainty about an unconfirmed claim. Many other news outlets took the same tack. “Celebrities, lawmakers rally behind Jussie Smollett in wake of brutal attack,” reported ABC News. “Jussie Smollett Performs at Troubadour Just Days After Chicago Attack: ‘I Had to Be Here Tonight’” read a Los Angeles Times headline. Many commenters linked the alleged attack to larger alleged sicknesses: “The racist, homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is far-right America’s endgame,” tweeted GQ, in a sentiment echoed by many others.

Possibly it might be wise to establish whether an incident actually happened before leaping to conclusions about it. Remember Covington? Oh, right, that was almost a whole month ago.

The certain tone of the reports about an attack that Jussie Smollett may or may not have suffered was notable given the strange circumstances surrounding the actor’s claims. The Times would have been on firm ground if it simply added six letters — “says he” — between the words “Empire” and “was attacked.” And the Times is generally wary of publishing as fact information that may or may not turn out to be true. So why put their reputation at risk by abandoning normal practice? I and many others expressed doubt that any attack had transpired the way Smollett described it.

This week Chicago’s ABC7 News reported that “multiple sources,” presumably in the Chicago Police Department, had called the alleged attack “staged” by Smollett and two accomplices. CBS2 News and the Chicago Tribune made similar reports. A spokesman for the CPD rushed to say that the sources cited were “uninformed and inaccurate.”

That there might be more to this story than met the eye seemed evident from the outset. Who walks around Chicago on a frigid night with a rope and a bottle of bleach looking for gay black men to attack — but then suddenly turns and runs away from the victim without doing him much injury or robbing him?

Yet Cory Booker went on Twitter to say, “The vicious attack on Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching.” Joe Biden: “What happened today to Jussie Smollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts.” Kamala Harris: “This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

One progressive reaction to the reports from Chicago that the Jussie Smollett case might be a hoax is simple dejection. Our friends on the left are saddened that a gay black man perhaps wasn’t viciously beaten up by Trump-loving thugs.

No, that’s not quite right, they protest: We’re upset because we all know that lots of gay people are getting attacked all over this country, and the publicity attending this story will make people discount these important true stories. The subtext is: We’re upset that the Right is winning another cultural battle.

But where is this epidemic of gay-bashing? The example people cite is Matthew Shepard. A mini-industry of books, plays, television docudramas and documentaries, and a charitable foundation was built around the case of the 21-year-old student tortured and beaten to death in Laramie, Wyo.

Shepard was killed 21 years ago. That’s it? One definitive, well-established case? Back in the Clinton era? Oh, and Shepard probably wasn’t killed for being gay in the first place. The FBI has lately started logging hate crimes. It came up with a log of 7,000 incidents of all kinds, in the entire country, in the supposed nightmare first year of the Trump administration, 2017. That’s every kind of hate crime, starting with graffiti vandalism. The incidence rate is in the range of 0.00002 percent.

A Twitter friend writes that all purely self-reported hate crimes should be presumed hoaxes. I certainly wouldn’t want the police to think that way, but for those of us who are merely outside observers such as journalists and politicians, reported hate crimes that have the structure of perfectly crafted narratives should be regarded with skepticism until proven true. The media tend to lose interest in hate-crime hoaxes once they’re unmasked, but as a glance at fakehatecrimes.org will show, there are a lot of liars out there.

Journalists whose priors align with those of activists ought to be doubly careful about taking at face value claims that seem wobbly, for the good of their own reputations. But it’s not just as a journalist that I doubted Smollett’s version(s) of events. I doubted it as an American. I decline to look at Chicago (or Kentucky, or Oklahoma, or anywhere else) and put much credence in the idea that vicious Trump-loving attackers are roaming around looking for minorities to assault.

Note that it doesn’t matter who the president might be; progressives always think that there’s a hate-crime crisis and always link it to whatever political narrative they’re currently bewailing. When President Obama was in office, it was “See? Elements of this country are so racist that having a black man in charge is causing them to lose their minds and go out on the rampage.”

How dismal it must be to be a progressive, to rest your political purview on extremely dark assumptions about the nature of the American psyche. Note that progressives also believe that, owing to nefarious right-wingers, Miami will shortly disappear beneath the waves (when you ask them why people are still buying waterfront condos with 30-year-mortgages they simply get angry) and that birth control will shortly be banned or, in the alternative, that women will be forced into becoming baby factories for Christian cultists à la The Handmaid’s Tale. No matter what the era or who is in charge, disaster always looms, and any weird anecdote that supports the larger doom narrative is eagerly, even devoutly, believed."

Now, Diamond and Silk have the nerve to feed into the rumor by using R. Kelly’s most recent and alleged sex tape as an example.

Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson babbled on Twitter, “Since Michael Avenatti claims to have an alleged tape of R. Kelly and an underage girl, wonder could he find the videotape of Jussie Smollett allegedly being attacked by two white men with bleach and a rope in Chicago?”

Clearly, there is no comparison to Smollett and Kelly, but being that these frauds love Trump and Avenatti has been trying to destroy 45 for nearly 2 years, they will find any angle to vouch for the predator in office. In addition, the thought that Smollett was possibly attacked by their base — racist white people — they would say anything to defend them.

The 36-year-old actor and singer made it clear on “Good Morning America” this week that he was not lying, despite mixed reporting from the notoriously corrupt Chicago Police Department and online rumors. He said, “For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing. I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—-, they called me a n—-. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett also said he was optimistic when he was told there was a camera where the attack took place, however, the camera was in the opposite direction, which he had no control over. The “Empire” actor had another theory on why people are doubting him, “I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone Black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more.. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.

Watch below:

""That says a lot about the place we are in our country right now."" @JussieSmollett tells @RobinRoberts if his attackers were of a different race other than white, he feels he would have been more supported. https://t.co/b5efiP0JCG pic.twitter.com/7BzpTV91fP — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 14, 2019

On Feb. 9, while walking to a subway, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor after he exited the restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Threatening letters directed at Smollett were reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago a week before. The cutout letters read, “You will die black f**.” See below:

Two Nigerian brothers were in custody as suspects but have since been released. In addition, Chicago police had to release a statement saying they were denying the internet rumors that the attack was being investigated as a hoax.

The rumor mill is on overdrive, hopefully, Chicago Police will finish their investigation sooner than later so people can stop speculation.

Smollett, a star on FOX's Empire, among other things, was attacked on a Chicago street on the night of Jan. 29. The actor's case has had some strange ups and downs as conflicting reports and evidence pile up. Some are even speculating that the assault was a hoax, and Smollet hiring a defense attorney has added fuel to that fire.

""Late tonight, high powered Chicago defense attorney Michael Monico confirmed to ET that he is now representing Jussie Smollett,"" tweeted Entertainment Tonight reporter Brendon Geoffrion on Friday. ""It is unclear when Monico began representing Smollett. Monico most recently represented President Donald Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen.""

Monico is a former federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Illinois. He first mentioned that he is representing Smollet during an interview on WGN's The Roe Conn Show on Thursday. It is still not clear how long he has represented the actor, nor in what capacity. His employment further complicates a confusing face.

Police arrested two Nigerian brothers on Wednesday, 27-year-old Olabinjo Osundairo and 25-year-old Abimbola Osundairo. They were released on Friday without any charges. After initially being described as suspects in the case, police said that they were absolved.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" said Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Still, now that the Osundairo brothers have been associated with the case as persons of interest, their futures are in question as well. The two had worked as extras on Empire, and the rumors suggested that they had orchestrated the attack with Smollett to get back at producers in some way. Their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, suggested that there was more to the story, but that the brothers would tell it in their own time.

""There's so many moving parts to this that will come out in time,"" she said. ""I'm going to let them tell their story when the time is right.""

Producers have denied that Smollett was in danger of being written off of Empire.

Smollett claims that two men attacked him late at night, calling out racist and homophobic slurs as they beat him. He says that they poured an unknown chemical on his head and tied a rope around his neck, yelling ""this is MAGA country"" before running off."

The two men, according to ABC7 Chicago, were the ones seen on surveillance video images released earlier.

“Yes, they are confirmed to be the men on scene by surveillance video,” Chicago Police told the media outlet. “The reason why they were there is now central to the investigation and we can’t get into that at this time.”

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi also gave ABC7 a statement and said the two individuals were no longer classified as suspects.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the statement said.

Gloria Schmidt, the attorney representing the two men — brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo — said the new evidence referenced by the police was given to them by her clients. The two men allegedly had a previous relationship with Smollett and one had appeared as an extra on “Empire.”

Even though the two men have been released, there is no indication police believe the alleged attack was staged. Previously, ABC7 reported that police were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack with the two men because he was being written off of “Empire,” but spokespeople for the TV show said there were no plans to eliminate Smollett’s character.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson assured ABC7 that Smollett is still being treated as a victim.

A TMZ “photog” asked Schmidt, the attorney for the two now released men, if the attack was staged. “[S]he answered obliquely, saying there were moving parts and she didn’t want to speculate,” the outlet reported.

TMZ also reported that Schmidt said her clients would tell their story “when the time is right,” and couldn’t answer a question as to why the two men left the country for Nigeria on the day of the alleged attack.

In late January, Smollett, while walking back from a Subway sandwich restaurant around 2 in the morning, was allegedly attacked by two men wearing masks who tied a rope around his neck, poured a liquid on him that smelled like bleach, and allegedly hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him. Surveillance footage from the night shows nearly all of Smollett’s trip that night except for about 60 seconds where the attack is alleged to have occurred.

Police raided the home of the two men who were arrested and reportedly confiscated some bleach. The investigation is ongoing, as police are still trying to track the origins of the rope placed around Smollett’s neck."

The announcement comes as detectives said they had identified and interviewed two men believed to have been seen in surveillance footage near the scene where actor Smollett was attacked late last month.

Smollett, 35, filed a report Jan. 29 with Chicago police stating that he was assaulted by two men who also threw an unknown chemical substance at him. He also told police that the men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him.

The next day, Chicago police released two stills from surveillance footage of two individuals walking down a street with their backs to the camera.

Police said they were ""potential persons of interest"" and were being sought for questioning.

""Through a meticulous investigation (Chicago) detectives have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member,"" Chicago police Chief Communications Office Anthony Guglielmi said Thursday in a tweet.

""These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned. Investigation continues.""

However, later Thursday, a Chicago news organization reported that police sources said the attack was being investigated to see if it was staged by the actor, a claim Chicago police were quick to dismiss.

""Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,"" Guglielmi said in a tweet.

The communications officer said that Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted the news organization to state on the record that ""we have no evidence to support their reporting.""

According to Deadline, there is a chance that Fox and National Geographic will likely postpone season two which is set to premiere on March 3.

The date had been planned before new accusations against Tyson arose.

Fox, Nat Geographic, and producers launched an investigation against the astrophysicist as a result of new accusations became public in late November.

Three women have come forward in accusing the astrophysicist of sexual misconduct.

The networks want the investigation to be completed before making the decision.

“The credo at the heart of Cosmos is to follow the evidence wherever it leads,” the show’s producers said in a statement to Deadline in November. “The producers of Cosmos can do no less in this situation. We are committed to a thorough investigation of this matter and to act accordingly as soon as it is concluded.”

The TV networks ordered a second installment with the TV personality returning as a host a year ago for the revival of the classic Carl Sagan docuseries. Tyson also hosts StarTalk, that airs on National Geographic. The show has been pulled off the air after allegations circulated.

In the show, Tyson interviews guests in pop culture, politics or news about the impact of technology on their lives and careers.

Tyson addressed the allegations on Facebook back in December saying:

“I’ve recently been publicly accused of sexual misconduct,” he wrote in the post. “These accusations have received a fair amount of press in the past forty-eight hours, unaccompanied by my reactions. In many cases, it’s not the media’s fault. I declined comment on the grounds that serious accusations should not be adjudicated in the press. But clearly I cannot continue to stay silent.”"

We’ve spoken with “Empire” cast and crew, and they say Ola and Abel Osundairo do not fit the profile of racists and homophobes — not even close. As we reported, both men have been extras on “Empire” for years and both are friendly with Jussie, and Abel is especially close to him. We’re told Jussie would frequently approach the brothers on set and chat about health and fitness. Our Empire sources say Abel especially is an ally of the LGBTQ community, and neither have ever said anything positive about Trump. They’re both big Obama fans.

We’re told Abel worked as an “Empire” extra as recently as a month ago. They’re considered family on the set … well-known and well-liked by cast and crew. The folks we’ve spoken with say they find it impossible to believe Ola and Abel have the DNA of criminals who would carry out the acts that Jussie describes — and obviously cops now believe that as well.

What do the cops believe? That’s very difficult to say given how close to the vest the Chicago Police Department is playing this investigation. A small hint was dropped this morning when the police issued another statement. ABC7 is reporting that the police have confirmed that the two brothers were the people seen on the surveillance video that police released a few days after the alleged attack and that interviews conducted by investigators with the brothers before they were released without charges uncovered new evidence that police are currently pursuing.

A police source told ABC7, “Yes, they are confirmed to be the men on the scene by surveillance video. The reason why they were there is now central to the investigation and we can’t get into that at this time.”

Smollett told Good Morning America on Thursday, before the brothers were arrested and released, that the men in the surveillance video were his attackers without “any doubt”:

Prior to the police identifying and interviewing the two persons of interest, Smollett said he believes the two men in the photo released by police in the days after the attack are the perpetrators. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” Smollett said. “Never did.”

How about now, Jussie?

“The reason why they were there” becoming central to the investigation is significant. But caution should be used to figure out why. If they were part of a hoax perpetrated by Smollett, you would think police would charge them as accessories — unless they made a deal with the cops to squeal on Smollett in exchange for their freedom.

Meanwhile, the police superintendent — dubbed Eddie “Special Ed” Johnson by some Chicago cops — continues to insist that Smollett is a victim:

But the most useless superintendent in history continues the charade: Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted ABC7 to say they are continuing to treat Smollett as a victim and the investigation remains ongoing. Just when you thought Special Ed couldn’t sink any lower, he finds a shovel in the basement of the ManHole and starts to dig.

In truth, that’s being a little hard on the guy. Racial tensions in the city of Chicago are sky-high and any hint that the cops are treating this story as a hoax would embarrass some very important black activists and politicians who have been pushing the “hate crime” narrative for two weeks. Rather than question Smollett’s honesty, they would just as soon finger the Chicago police as racists.

I’m sure the cops would love Smollett to confess rather than have to “prove” he filed a false police report. That would make things easier on the police, and on the politicians and activists. But Smollett has a huge investment in this narrative. It could be a career-ender for him if he admits to a hoax. So he will likely stand by his story no matter what, trusting that his allies in the black community and the media will support him."

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

""The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police earlier this week said there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation.

According to CBS Chicago, the police have stated that the man was 45-year-old employee Gary Martin, a 15-year employee at Henry Pratt company.

Martin was being terminated at his job on Friday when he shot and killed his co-workers. He also injured five officers and an employee. All of the victims were identified as men, but their names have yet to be revealed, CNN states.

The gunman, who was killed, opened fire with a Smith & Wesson handgun at employees before exchanging shots with officers who arrived at the 29,000 square-foot building four minutes after calls were received about the active shooter around 1:30 p.m., according to Aurora Police Chief, Kristen Ziman.

—Jussie Smollett Case: Nigerian brothers released without charge while police evaluate new evidence—

John Probst, 40, an employee of the manufacturing business and a survivor said Martin “running down the aisle” with a pistol that had a green laser sight on it.

“As soon as I saw the green thing and heard the shots, we left,” said Probst “He started opening up on the room, and he was just shooting everybody.”

Five officers were struck by gunshots and another officer hurt his knee. All of the officers were taken to local hospitals, and two of them were airlifted to trauma centers. Ziman said all of the officers were shot within five minutes of responding. The officers and the one worker who was shot, injuries are not life-threatening, Ziman said.

Illinois Governor, J.B. Pritzker released a statement regarding the horrific incident.

—Gloria Allred: Teen shown on the new R. Kelly tape may be her client—

“There is no way to prepare,” Pritzker said. “There are no words for the kind of evil that robs our neighbors of their hopes, their dreams and their futures,” he said in the statement. “There are no words to express our gratitude to the families of the officers who were injured in the line of duty as they responded within moments to the gravest kind of danger that they can face.”

Ziman said a Kane County Sheriff’s Office task force from the will investigate Martin’s death."

The two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, are no longer suspects in the attack. Surveillance footage confirms that they were on the scene, which Chicago police are continuing to investigate.

TMZ reported that the Osundairo brothers have been extras on Empire for a few years now and Abel has a close relationship with Smollett. It was recently alleged that the brothers and Smollett staged this attack because he is being written out of the FOX drama. Smollett’s reps deny that he is being written out of the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” Fox Entertainment said in a statement.

First, the Chicago Police Department finally arrested two suspects in the case. Did they nab the racist Trump supporters who attacked him? Did they prove his story is all true?

See for yourself:

Two Suspects Arrested In Jussie Smollett Hate Crime Attack https://t.co/14niBiZm7w pic.twitter.com/7gu8mYVDTq — The Source Magazine (@TheSource) February 15, 2019

Oh.

Well, they’re not quite what I was expecting, but that doesn’t necessarily mean anything. As Smollett himself said of his attackers: “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more.” See, the problem isn’t that his story doesn’t hold up. The problem is that you’re a racist if you don’t believe him. Now that I see that the suspects are black, I support him… even less. This does not assuage any of my doubts. So obviously, that makes me even more racist than I was before I saw his suspected assailants.

And now, in an even weirder twist, the CPD has released those two Nigerian* brothers, one of whom has worked as an extra on Smollett’s show Empire. They’re no longer suspects. And Smollett has now hired a criminal defense lawyer, the same one who represents Michael Cohen.

Obviously, this can only mean one thing: Jussie Smollett’s real attackers are still out there!

As far as I can figure, there are three explanations for the discrepancies between Smollett’s story and consensus reality. Three possible culprits, still on the loose. Drum roll, please…

Alt-right ninjas. The police say they’ve reviewed all the surveillance footage in the area at the time Smollett says it happened, and there’s no record of any attack. However, there’s a 60-second gap where Smollett can’t be seen on camera. Do you have any idea how much damage a ninja can do in 60 seconds? Hell, 6 seconds! We all know how violent the alt-right is, so who’s to say some of them haven’t become ninjas? Can you prove that highly trained MAGA-ninjas didn’t appear out of nowhere, in an area along Smollett’s path that they knew wasn’t covered by security cameras, to attack him as revenge for his anti-Trump tweets? Can you prove they didn’t then throw one of those little smoke bombs and disappear into the night? Can you? Huh? Answer the question, you Nazi! Thanos. As you know if you saw the 2018 documentary Avengers: Infinity War, the cosmic demigod and genocidal tyrant known as Thanos has finally acquired all six Infinity Stones, giving him control over reality itself. Now that he’s basically omnipotent and omniscient, he’s used his powers to reduce half the living beings in the universe (including half of Marvel’s highly lucrative IP) to fireplace ashes. So, what’s next? Sure, Thanos might just sit around on his front porch, smiling at the sunrise. But if he can do literally anything he wants now, why wouldn’t he use his reality-warping powers to mess with Jussie Smollett? Why wouldn’t he use the combined powers of the Space Stone, the Power Stone, the Reality Stone, the Soul Stone, the Time Stone, and the Mind Stone to commit the perfect crime against social justice? C’mon, you know he voted for Trump. Nobody. Nobody did it. It’s a hoax. Jussie Smollett made it up. He faked a hate crime to draw attention to himself, and to smear supporters of his hated enemy Donald Trump. The only problem with this theory is that it’s racist and homophobic, because Smollett is black and gay. He’s #intersectionalAF, so the normal rules don’t apply. I’m sorry I even brought it up, without a trigger warning or anything.

We’ll see. But one thing is for sure: If it turns out that Smollett faked this whole thing, you can expect some sheepish public apologies from all the celebrities and other libs who blamed Republicans everywhere. All the people who scolded us for being skeptical will acknowledge that they were wrong. They’ll admit that they’re the bigots. That will definitely happen.

I love science fiction!

There is no such thing as “racially charged.”

A minor note - Chicago PD has corrected the information regarding the bleach bottle, telling Fox News that it came from the former suspects' apartment, not Smollett's.

Update4: Chicago PD reportedly reached out to Smollett's legal team ""and expressed interest"" in talking with the ""Empire"" star again.

Update3: According to Fox32 Chicago's Rafer Weigel, Chicago PD detectives were able to link the two Nigerian brothers to the purchase of the rope found around Smollett's neck, and they may have been paid to perform the alleged attack.

""The brothers agreed to cooperate with police who are investigating whether Smollett made up the story after police threatened to charge them with battery.

Update: In a disturbing (if not altogether unsurprising, given the unconfirmed reports that have circulated in recent days) turn of events, sources from within the Chicago Police Department have reportedly told Fox News that they believe Jussie Smollett's story of being attacked by two white men was a ""scripted"" ""hoax"".

Police have also confirmed to Fox that they seized a bottle of bleach from Smollett's apartment (remember, Smollett accused his attackers of pouring bleach on him).

Now that the two (black) men suspected of involvement in the attack have been released, we imagine we'll be learning more about what really happened in the near future.

* * *

Jussie Smollett, the Empire star who claims he beat off two white men after they assaulted him in a 2am hate crime in late January, has retained Michael Monico - the high-powered criminal defense attorney representing former Trump fixer Michael Cohen.

Appearing on WGN's ""The Roe Conn Show,"" Monico was asked about his thoughts on Smollett, ""but we can't get your thoughts on Jussie Smollett because [of] this big developing story today, and it turns out you're the attorney for Jussie Smollett, too,"" said Conn.

""Yes, at the moment, I am,"" replied Monico.

""Oh for god sakes,"" Conn joked. ""Can you stop getting clients so I can talk to you about the stories?""

Smollett, 36, alleges he was attacked around 2am on January 29 by two white men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him, doused him in a liquid that smelled like bleach, hung a thin rope around his neck and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" before he was able to chase them off. Somehow Smollett was able to keep a grip on his Subway sandwich throughout the ordeal, which he was seen on surveillance still holding when he returned to his apartment.

""And above all I fought the fuck back,"" said Smollett on February 2.

News of Smollett retaining a criminal defense attorney comes as Chicago police release on Friday night of two persons of interest without charges; Nigerian-born brothers who are acquaintances of Smollett.

The men have been confirmed to be the men seen on surveillance images of the scene of the alleged incident. Chicago Police tell ABC News the reason the men were on the scene is now central to the investigation.

The brothers were identified by the Daily Mail as Nigerian-born actors Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo - one of whom was an extra on ""Empire.""

Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News in Chicago that police have been investigating whether Smollett and the men staged the attack - ""allegedly because Smollett was being written off ""Empire.""""

A source familiar with the investigation told the ABC7 I-Team that Smollett failed to appear for an interview with detectives earlier Thursday but has since spoken with police.



Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted ABC7 to say they are continuing to treat Smollett as a victim and the investigation remains ongoing.



""Police are investigating whether the two individuals committed the attack - or whether the attack happened at all,"" Chicago police told ABC News. -ABC 7

Smollett's representatives as well as the writing staff for Empire deny he is being written off the show.

Speaking with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America Thursday, Smollett reflected on the alleged incident.

""It's the attackers, but also the attacks,"" he said - adding that those who don't believe his account ""don't even want to see the truth.""

According to Chicago PD's Guglielmi, Smollett's comments on GMA are consistent with what he has told Chicago police."

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and the detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi shared in a statement.

Smollet was allegedly attacked in Chicago on January 29. Sources claimed that the actor involved in an apparent hate crime, during which the assailants allegedly placed a noose around Smollett’s neck, poured a chemical believed to be bleach over his head, and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. Following the attack, multiple anonymous sources led Chicago police to investigate whether the attack was potentially staged. In response to these reports, a spokesperson from the Chicago Police Department denied that Smollett is considered a suspect rather than a victim, claiming that there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax.”

Earlier this week, the Empire actor gave his first televised interview since the attack, where he described the attack in detail, refuting claims that he had told authorities that the attackers were wearing Make America Great Again hats. “They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r.

Chicago Police Department(CHICAGO) — Two men arrested by Chicago police police earlier this week in the alleged racial attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett were released on Friday night.

Police clarified that the two men were placed under arrest Wednesday night after police met them at the airport.

But in a statement issued Friday night, Chicago Police Department officials said that “due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questions by police in the Empire case have now been released without charg[es], and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

The two are no longer being classified as suspects.

The release of the two men followed hours after police told ABC News they were classifying them as potential suspects.

They also shut down any reports that there was evidence to classify the alleged attack as a hoax.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” police added. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

Chicago PD had confirmed Thursday that they identified and were questioning the two “persons of interest” in the alleged racial attack. One of them has previously appeared on “Empire,” according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.

Police say they were tracking the two suspects and were aware of who they were “for a while,” and that investigators learned that the two individuals were returning to Chicago on Wednesday from Nigeria.

The two suspects are U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent, they added.

Detectives also questioned Smollett Thursday, the official said.

Attorney Gloria Schmidt, who is representing the two persons of interest, told Chicago CBS station WBBM that her clients were detained at O’Hare Airport Wednesday evening and were unaware of the attack on Smollett.

“When they first learned what happened to him, they were horrified,” Schmidt said. “This is someone that they know, this is someone that they work with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that. … They really don’t understand how [police] even got information that linked them to this horrific crime, but they’re not guilty of it.”

Late last month, Smollett, who portrays a gay musician on Fox’s “Empire,” told police he was brutally attacked in what authorities are calling a suspected hate crime.

He said the attackers put a noose around his neck, poured an unknown substance, likely bleach, on him and used their hands, feet and teeth as weapons in the assault, according to police. Smollett said the attackers also yelled “This is MAGA country” during the attack.

He was subsequently hospitalized and released, local authorities said.

Jussie Smollett heartbroken over criticism after attack: ‘You don’t even want to see the truth’

In his first interview since police say he was attacked last month, the singer and actor said on “Good Morning America” that he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” Smollett, 36, told ABC News’ Robin Roberts. “And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Prior to the police identifying and interviewing the two persons of interest, Smollett said he believes the two men in the photo released by police in the days after the attack are the perpetrators.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” Smollett said. “Never did.”

As we reported, both men have been extras on ""Empire"" for years and both are friendly with Jussie, and Abel is especially close to him. We're told Jussie would frequently approach the brothers on set and chat about health and fitness.

Ola and Abel Osundairo, the two brothers from Nigeria who were arrested and detained by police in connection with the Jussie Smollett ""hate crime"" incident, are not ""racist, homophobic, or pro-Trump,"" according to TMZ.

Our Empire sources say Abel especially is an ally of the LGBTQ community, and neither have ever said anything positive about Trump. They're both big Obama fans.

The brothers were caught on a security camera recording somewhere near where Smollett alleges that the attack took place on the night in question. In fact, Smollett told Good Morning America on Thursday, before the brothers were arrested, that he was positive they were the attackers:

Prior to the police identifying and interviewing the two persons of interest, Smollett said he believes the two men in the photo released by police in the days after the attack are the perpetrators. ""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them,"" Smollett said. ""Never did.""

The plot thickens.

Does this sound like people who would yell ""MAGA country!"" at a well known gay actor?

We're told Abel worked as an ""Empire"" extra as recently as a month ago. They're considered family on the set ... well-known and well-liked by cast and crew. The folks we've spoken with say they find it impossible to believe Ola and Abel have the DNA of criminals who would carry out the acts that Jussie describes — and obviously cops now believe that as well. Police arrested the brothers for battery Friday after cops raided their home Wednesday and seized a long list of items, including several bottles of bleach. However, late Friday Chicago PD released the brothers due to ""new evidence"" gathered from their interrogation ... and said they're no longer suspects. As we reported, Jussie initially said his attackers were white — yet another fact that just doesn't track with the Osundairos [sic] profile.

AT's Taylor Day reports that Smollett has retained a defense attorney and that police have searched his residence. Due to the unusual behavior by police in keeping almost all information about this case from the public, we don't know what they are still investigating after releasing the Nigerian brothers, what direction the investigation is going in, or if they believe that Smollett filed a false police report.

Chicago P.D. statements on the case have been very, very careful not to point the finger at Smollett. The police spokesman said ""there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax."" That was Friday after the brothers were released, which could indicate that they were in the clear if the cops thought they helped Smollett stage the attack.

In truth, much of the CPD is walking on tiptoes around this incident, and specifically, Smollett's allegations. As more facts emerge that contradict Smollett's original narrative of what happened, the police are bending over backward to maintain that Smollett is a ""victim.""

Second City Cop:

But the most useless superintendent in history continues the charade: Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted ABC7 to say they are continuing to treat Smollett as a victim and the investigation remains ongoing. Just when you thought Special Ed couldn't sink any lower, he finds a shovel in the basement of the ManHole and starts to dig.



Does anyone have a picture of the Search Warrant copy left behind? One media outlet had it and broadcast it. We're told that the list of items being sought/seized has one rather interesting item that could spell big problems for Smollett and his accomplices.

That item could be a bottle of bleach that was taken from Smollett's residence. Indeed, there is nothing remarkable about anyone having bleach lying around the house. But forensics can determine not only what brand of bleach was splashed on Smollett's clothes the night of the attack, but if the bleach came from the same bottle that was found in his apartment.

The cops would dearly love for Smollett to confess. It would make it much easier on them and on the city. But Smollett has so much invested in this narrative that he will probably go down insisting that his version is the truth."

The two men who were arrested by Chicago Police earlier this week in regards to the “Empire” actor‘s alleged attack have now been released without charges. Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Communications Officer for Chicago Police, took to Twitter on Friday night to share the update.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the ‘Empire’ case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the statement reads. The news comes hours after Guglielmi announced there would be no press conference about the case.

Chicago Police confirmed to ET on Friday morning that the two men who have been questioned by police since earlier this week were arrested Wednesday night. A spokesperson for Chicago Police confirmed to ET that it was the same two individuals who were captured on surveillance video around the same time as the alleged attack on the “Empire” star in the early morning hours of Jan. 29. Police have yet to release the names of these men.

“Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney. While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim [Smollett] is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi told ET earlier in the day. “For clarification, the two individuals interviewed are classified as potential suspects. Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.”

Meanwhile, ET has confirmed that Smollett has hired high-powered Chicago criminal defence attorney Michael Monico, who is now representing the star.

Monico is best known as one of the defence attorneys representing President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and alleged “fixer” Michael Cohen; no reason was provided as to why Smollett, the victim of the alleged attack, would require the services of a criminal defence lawyer.

High-profile #Chicago defense attorney Michael Monico let it be known he was representing #JussieSmollett on @RoeConn radio show today. Monico also represents #MichaelCohen. He's considered one of the best defense lawyers in the country. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 16, 2019

On Thursday, police once again questioned Smollett, as well as raided the home of the two aforementioned men.

Local Chicago media reports claim that Smollett is being investigated for potentially orchestrating his own attack.

There were also reports earlier this week that the actor might have staged the attack, thinking he might have been being written off “Empire”. However, the network and studio released a statement to ET denying Smollett’s character was being dropped from the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” the joint statement read. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

This all comes after Smollett made his first television appearance since the attack, appearing on “Good Morning America” to tearfully recount the incident.

Chicago Police Department announced on Friday evening that the two suspects involved in the case have been released.

No charges were filed against the Nigerian brothers after two days of questioning, according to Variety.

According to local reports, the police searched the home of the two brothers on Wednesday night and found items such as electronics, shoes, and bleach.

Anthony Guglielmi, the police spokesman said that there were new details in the case which caused the police to release brothers and state they that were no longer suspects.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Guglielmi said.

The brothers’ attorney told CBS Chicago that they knew Smollett from starring in the TV show, Empire. The brothers and Smollett also go to the same gym.

Their attorney also denied that the two men attacked Smollett.

Defense attorney Michael Monico, who has decades of experience, confirmed to Variety on Friday that he is representing Smollett. Monico is a well-known attorney. He most recently represented President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen in his criminal case.

Although there have been reports that the incident involving Smollett was staged, the Chicago Police Department has stated that they have no evidence to prove that it was and Smollett is still a victim in the case.

Gugliemi denied the reports on Twitter stating:

“Media reports [about] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” he wrote. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O’Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett’s account.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on “Empire” and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of “Empire” released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was “patently ridiculous,” and that they continue to stand behind him.

What are the details?

The brothers, who police apprehended at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport Wednesday as they re-entered the United States, were released from police custody late Friday night. They were not charged with any crimes.

CPD spokesman Anthony said investigators were compelled to release the brothers after new evidence surfaced.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the 'Empire' case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Guglielmi said in a statement.

Additionally, police no longer consider the brothers ""suspects"" in the case. Their release comes one day after police raided the Chicago apartment the men shared. Investigators did not reveal whether they discovered evidence linking the men to the alleged crime.

The brothers — who are acquaintances of Smollett and have ties to ""Empire,"" the hit TV show Smollett stars in — had been booked on suspicion of assault and battery, TMZ reported Friday.

Is the assault a hoax?

Smollett alleges he was attacked early on the morning of Jan. 29. He told police two masked men — who he originally said were white — attacked him, yelled homophobic and racial slurs at him, tied a rope around his neck, and poured a chemical substance on him.

According to WLS-TV, ""multiple sources"" have said police are investigating the possibility the attack was staged. However, police publicly deny that fact, citing a lack of evidence to suggest a hoax.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told WLS investigators still currently consider Smollett a victim."

Two men identified as ""potential suspects"" in the alleged attack on ""Empire"" TV actor Jussie Smollett have been released without charge, police in the US city of Chicago said late Friday.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay, reported to police on January 29 that two men beat him while he walked downtown in the third-largest American city.

He alleged they yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck, prompting police to initially describe the case as a possible hate crime.

Earlier on Friday police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives had ""probable cause"" that two men arrested may have been involved in an alleged offense.

But late the same day, Tom Ahern, the police Deputy Director of News Affairs and Communications, said on Twitter that ""the individuals questioned by police in the #Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.""

He said the step followed ""new evidence as a result of today's interrogations.""

Police initially announced the arrest of the two men after US media reported that investigators were probing the possibility that the attack was staged.

Guglielmi, however, told AFP ""there is no evidence"" to say it was a hoax.

Multiple US media outlets reported the two men are brothers who were arrested at Chicago's O'Hare airport upon return from a trip to Nigeria. At least one of the men reportedly worked on ""Empire,"" a series about the fortunes of an ailing hip-hop mogul and his family battling over control of a multi-million dollar music company.

Smollett has expressed anger over rumors and speculation reported in the media doubting his account.

Initial reports of the attack shocked the entertainment industry and brought waves of support from advocacy groups."

This is becoming a real head-scratcher…

On Friday night, police released Ola and Abel Osundairo, the two Nigerian brothers and Empire extras who had previously been suspects in the Jussie Smollett attack case, with neither one being charged with a crime at this point.

Related: Was This Attack Staged?!

Even more confusing, per TMZ, the two men are reportedly pro-LGBTQ and very anti-Donald Trump, which “has people on the Empire set scratching their heads,” considering Smollett’s accusations that his attackers were pro-Trump and shouted anti-gay rhetoric.

One of the brothers, Abel, reportedly worked as an extra on the Empire set as recently as a month ago — and each man is “well-known and well-liked” by both cast and crew.

Furthermore, Jussie would “frequently” approach each of the brothers on set to chat about health and fitness, per TMZ sources.

So something doesn’t add up here — or police had the wrong guys from the start.

Smollett has long said his attackers were white, which obviously doesn’t track with these two.

And cops officially said on Friday night that the pair are no longer suspects, after being interrogated about the case itself and then officially released from police custody.

What happens now? So confusing!

The latest development comes shortly after two men were arrested and questioned in connection with the incident, which remains under investigation.

The 36-year-old actor required hospital treatment after a suspected racist and homophobic attack in Chicago last month, and the two men — identified in multiple news reports as two brothers from Nigeria — were arrested during the week but released without charge after questioning.Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote on Twitter: “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

The attorney for the brothers told CBS Chicago that his clients know Smollett and that they sometimes work out at the same gym. He denied his clients were responsible for the attack.

Meanwhile, defense attorney Michael Monico has confirmed to Variety that he is now representing Smollett.

Smollett has told police he was attacked on Jan. 29, 2019, by two men, who he has accused of launching a racist and homophobic attack on him.

He also discussed the incident on “Good Morning America,” saying it had all happened “so fast” while he was out getting food.

He recalled: “I went to the Subway, got my order. During that time I texted my manager, thinking that he was still in Australia … I said, ‘Call me when you can.’ He called me immediately and while he was on the phone, I heard as I was crossing the intersection, ‘Empire!’ And I don’t answer to ‘Empire’, my name ain’t ‘Empire’.

“And I didn’t answer, I kept walking, and then I heard, “f—ing ‘Empire’ n—–.’ So I turned around and I said, ‘What the f— did you just say to me?’ And I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘This MAGA country, n—-,’ and he punched me right in the face. So I punched his ass back and then we started tussling.

“There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back and then it just stopped and they ran off.

“It happened so fast. It felt like minutes but it was probably 30 seconds.”"

Authorities said they have new information after questioning the two men, the AP reported.

“The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement late Friday, without offering further details.

The two men, who are brothers and U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent, were arrested Friday at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport in connection with a reported racist and homophobic attack against the ""Empire"" star last month.

Guglielmi said police searched the two men's apartment, but did not give any information on what was found.

A spokeswoman for Smollett declined to comment to the AP on the release of the two men Friday.

Smollett has said two men shouted, “This is MAGA country!” at him, beat him and placed a rope around his neck late last month. The actor, who is black and gay, says a chemical was also poured on him. Police have been investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Police have not yet found video of the attack but are contacting stores to try to find who bought the rope.

Law enforcement earlier this week shot down speculation that the attack was a hoax, confirming Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”"

Imagine if this charge got so much publicity that the entire leadership of the Republican Party, including President Donald Trump, along with most of the conservative media, rushed to his defense and unambiguously condemned what they universally called a hate crime.

Imagine if the circumstances surrounding such an attack were extremely odd and, a couple of weeks later, still could not be substantiated by police despite hundreds of man hours accessing voluminous amounts of camera footage from the very conservative area surrounding the attack. Imagine further that Woods claimed that he was on his cell phone with his manager during the very late-night attack, but refused to hand over that phone, and eventually only provided a very incomplete record of his calls.

Imagine, if after the police started to quietly question his story, Woods went on Fox and Friends and, in a softball interview with Steve Doocy, confirmed that a blurry photo of two “persons of interest” contained the images of the two men who did this to him. Imagine then that the police, apparently knowing all along who those two blurry figures really were, suddenly take those two men in for questioning and eventually arrest them as suspects in the case.

Oh, and those two men turn out to be brothers, Trump supporters, unambiguously white, and with at least one of them having appeared in the same show as Woods, with evidence that they are friends. Then the police, suddenly, citing “new evidence,” release the two brothers without charging them, all while Woods quickly hires a high-priced lawyer to add to a new PR firm.

If that set of facts existed, I would submit to you that the mainstream media and the political left would have already turned Woods into at least Harvey Weinstein, if not Ted Bundy. There would be no hesitancy whatsoever to put, even before an arrest, all these dots together and create the picture that Woods’ story was false, that he had duped the nation, and that he needed to be severely punished for having committed what they would see as one of the largest cultural crimes in modern history.

Those are the exact set of circumstances surrounding Empire actor Jussie Smollett, only in reverse, and the mainstream media and political left are, at least so far, doing their very best to pretend that maybe nothing at all unusual has really happened here. I am all for NOT rushing to judgement (something the news media usually is far too vulnerable to doing when it suits their agenda), but we have now reached the point in this story where it is finally time for the official narrative to take a dramatic change.

The identity of the brothers, who are body-builders from Nigeria and could not possibly be mistaken for being white (something TMZ has reported Smollett claimed, at least at first, was the case) really is the proof that Smollett’s story is not true. There is just no way that these two guys, at least one of whom was apparently friends with Smollett and worked on Empire, attacked him because he was black, gay, and anti-Trump.

So, using just basic logic (an exercise all-too-often beyond the ability of the average media person), if the two Nigerians were his “attackers,” or at least the guys in the released surveillance video, that is game, set, match for Smollett’s hate crime allegation. Given what we know about how the police detained them, and how long they held them for questioning while under “arrest,” it would be nearly inconceivable for them not to be the two people Smollett himself identified as his attackers on GMA (back when he clearly mistakenly thought there was no way that the police would ever find them, when, in reality, they apparently already had them ID’d from almost the beginning of the story).

But what are we to make of the police releasing them without charges? Well, the authorities citing “new evidence” and “more investigation” to be completed, along with Smollett suddenly lawyering up in a big way, makes it about as obvious as could be that the brothers have “flipped” on Smollett, and that they are not currently being charged because they are no longer law enforcement’s primary target.

While these conclusions require some speculation, they do not necessitate anything close to a real leap. Perhaps more importantly, this is the only scenario consistent with everything we think we currently know. Admittedly, to be fair, our knowledge of the incident is still rather spotty.

To be clear, none of this tells us what actually DID happen that night. I honestly am still torn between this being some sort of premeditated “hoax,” a hate-crime concocted as a cover story in a panic after a violent dispute between the three of them, or, perhaps, some really bizarre hybrid of those two possibilities. We may find out the truth any day now, or maybe we will never know for sure.

But, at this point, there is one thing that every thinking and objective person who cares about the truth should be able to comfortably and publicly conclude: Jussie Smollett was almost certainly not the victim of a random pro-Trump hate crime because of his race, sexuality, and politics. It is time for the news media and the liberal political establishment to, at the very least, make the public aware that this is what the facts, as we currently know them, indicate.

The reality that they very likely won’t do this is exactly why Trump fans don’t trust a damn thing they say, and after this story and the Covington Catholic fiasco coming back-to-back, probably never will again.

Smollett was allegedly attacked on Jan. 29. He claimed two men said racial and homophobic slurs, beat him up, poured an unknown substance on him and said, “This is MAGA country.”

Several media outlets and journalists circulated allegations from sources that Smollett and the two men had planned the attack.

Guglielmi, however, said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate” in a tweet Thursday.

Cast members say that brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo were actually friendly with Smollett and are pro-LGBTQ and anti-Trump.

TMZ reports:

We’ve spoken with “Empire” cast and crew, and they say Ola and Abel Osundairo do not fit the profile of racists and homophobes — not even close. As we reported, both men have been extras on “Empire” for years and both are friendly with Jussie, and Abel is especially close to him. We’re told Jussie would frequently approach the brothers on set and chat about health and fitness.

…

The folks we’ve spoken with say they find it impossible to believe Ola and Abel have the DNA of criminals who would carry out the acts that Jussie describes — and obviously cops now believe that as well.

Police arrested the brothers for battery Friday after cops raided their home Wednesday and seized a long list of items, including several bottles of bleach. However, late Friday Chicago PD released the brothers due to “new evidence” gathered from their interrogation … and said they’re no longer suspects.

Smollett has stated that his attackers were white, thus the arrest of the brothers may have just been a formality to eliminate them as suspects.

Ellen Page has opened up about how uncomfortable she used to feel in an interview with The Independent, about her role in the Netflix’s series, The Umbrella Academy, which premiered yesterday.

Speaking about her character’s, Vanya, journey of self-discovery Page said: “She’s going from this place of repression, to finding out who she is, to getting in touch with the rage she has, that leads into this… power.”

However, Page also opened up in the interview about her own journey of self-discovery, describing herself in her early career as “very, very closeted.”

She described how she was “making her girlfriends leave buildings through different exits, or hide in hotel bathrooms when room service came.” She added, while shaking her head: “I mean, I barely touched a woman outside until I was 27 years old.”

Ellen Page came out in 2014, in a speech to the Time to THRIVE conference for the Human Rights Watch. “I wasn’t OK, physically, at the time. I had a lot of physical stuff that was happening. I was very susceptible to panic attacks,” she said at the time.

And clicking her fingers, she said: “And coming out, like, it was as if I transformed overnight.”

And since coming out, Page has been a passionate LGBTQ rights activist. Earlier this month, she slammed Donald Tr*mp for his anti-LGBTQ policies.

“I am really fired up tonight, it feels impossible not to feel this way right now, with the president and Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married,” she said.

“Let’s just be clear. The Vice President of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the Governor of Indiana.”

She then made reference to the attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who was beaten and had a noose tied around his neck in a suspected homophobic and racist attack.

“Connect the dots. This is what happens,” she continued.

“If you are in a position of power, and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go though your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?

“Kids are gonna be abused, and they’re gonna kill themselves, and people are gonna be beaten on the streets.

“I have travelled the world and I have met the most marginalised people you could meet. I am lucky to have the time and the privilege to say this. This needs to fucking stop.”

Local media reports about the attack being staged are “unconfirmed”, Chicago police’s chief communications officer said. “We have no evidence to support their reporting.”

Mr Smollett said he’s been “forever changed” by the attack.

Superintendent Eddie Johnson has contacted local media in Chicago to tell them their “supposed” Chicago Police sources are “uninformed and inaccurate”.

“I will never be the man that this did not happen to,” the 36-year-old actor said in his first interview since two men punched him, poured a chemical substance over him, and put a rope around his neck.

As time has passed and no progress has been made with the investigation, some have cast doubts about Jussie’s version of events.

Recounting the night publicly for the first time, Jussie told American network ABC that he hesitated to call police after it happened because of pride.

“We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak. And I am not weak. And we as a people are not weak.”

When police came he says he left the rope around his neck and was still wearing clothes that smelled of bleach.

“I went down to where it happened and I walked them through exactly what happened.”

Jussie says he’d just got back to Chicago that day, and after getting home realised there was no food in the house. He says he ended up at a Subway sandwich shop getting some food – something people have questioned as strange.

He told Good Morning America it’s “ridiculous” that people think he’d lie about his reasons for being outside at 2am in freezing temperatures.

“Subway is open 24 hours for a reason, so that when you’re hungry at night and you ain’t got no food, you go to Subway,” he said.

Jussie thinks he would’ve been doubted less if he said his attacker “was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black”.

“And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

There were claims Jussie had told police his attackers were wearing the Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats that are associated with President Donald Trump.

“I never said that. I didn’t need to add anything like that,” Jussie said.

“I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

But the attackers did say “This is MAGA country”, he said.

The actor thinks he was targeted because he’s outspoken about President Trump – who when asked about the attack on Jussie said “That’s horrible, it doesn’t get worse”.

“I don’t know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it,” Jussie said of Trump’s comments.

Writers of US show Empire have stood behind the actor since the attack – and after reports that plans to write Jussie off the show led to the hoax, they came out in support of him again.

Earlier Friday, Guglielmi said two Nigerian brothers were being treated as “potential suspects” and that detectives had “probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.”

Police did not say at that time precisely what the brothers were accused of or what the alleged crime might have been.

The two men and Smollett had some kind of previous affiliation, a police source told CNN, without providing further detail.

Smollett, one of the stars of the TV drama “Empire,” told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who lobbed “racial and homophobic slurs” at him.

After a brief struggle, both men ran away, and Smollett told police that one attacker had allegedly put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

“Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney,” Guglielmi said in Friday’s statement. “While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax.”

“The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” he added.

Police said Thursday they were questioning the two men after meeting them at Chicago O’Hare International Airport Wednesday night, but they were not considered suspects at that time. Their apartment was searched by police earlier this week.

One of the brothers has appeared on “Empire,” according to police.

Authorities previously released surveillance images of two silhouetted figures in the area of the attack and said they were wanted for questioning.

Smollett shared his detailed account of the alleged attack in a Thursday morning interview on “Good Morning America,” in which he rejected reports that he said he told police the attackers wore Make America Great Again hats.

“I never said that,” he said. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”"

Also on Friday, defense attorney Michael Monico confirmed to Variety that he is now representing Smollett, one of the stars of “Empire.”

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that two men attacked him, yelled homophobic and racial slurs, poured bleach on him, and put a rope around his neck. Local media has reported that investigators are looking into whether the incident was staged. The Chicago Police Department has said that it had no evidence of that, and that Smollett is still being treated as a victim.

Monico is a high-powered defense attorney with decades of experience. He recently represented Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, in his criminal case.

The two men released Friday evening — who police have not officially identified — had been under arrest, though police never disclosed what charges they could potentially face. The attorney for the two Nigerian brothers told CBS Chicago that both know Smollett from “Empire,” and that they go to the same gym. The attorney denied that the men had attacked Smollett.

Police searched the home of the two brothers on Wednesday night, finding electronics, shoes, and bleach, according to local reports.

Fox issued a statement on Thursday standing by the actor, and strongly dismissing a report that Smollett may have acted out because he was being written off the show.

The Empire actor was beaten in a January 28 attack that he claimed had racial motivations, with the actor claiming two men wearing masks attacked him, put a noose on his neck, and poured an unknown chemical on him. Police scoured surveillance video and found images of two men in the same area as Smollett. As the Hollywood Reporter noted, the men were found and questioned by police, but were released without being charged.

Police said the pair provided “new evidence” during their interrogation, but did not say exactly what this evidence might be.

“EMPIRE CASE UPDATE: Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the #Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago PD deputy director of news affairs and communications Tom Ahern tweeted.

As Fox News reported, the two men picked up by police at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport in connection with the attack were identified as brothers from Nigeria who worked out in the luxury apartment building where Smollett lived. At least one of the men had worked on Empire and they appeared to be connected to Smollett, who followed the pair on social media.

There had been a previous report that the Empire actor staged the attack as a hoax because he was being written off Empire, but both the Chicago Police Department and producers from Empire denied these reports. Despite the denials, many who had already suspected the attack of being a hoax — especially a number of right-wing media commentators — criticized Smollett.

Jussie Smollett has vehemently denied any allegations that the attack was a hoax or that he was in on the planning of it. In an emotional interview with Good Morning America, the actor said he fought back during the attack and afterward was hesitant to contact police because he feared being stigmatized.

“There’s a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak, and I’m not weak and we as a people are not weak,” Smollett said.

Chicago police have continued to say that Jussie Smollett is not considered a suspect and they have no evidence pointing to the attack being staged."

Smollett, who's black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away.

The US TV star needed hospital treatment last month after a suspected racist and homophobic attack.

A police spokesperson said on Friday the men were released without charge and were no longer being classified as suspects.

Jussie Smollett said he’d been “forever changed” by the alleged attack, which took place on 29 January.

The 36-year-old actor has said two white men hurling racial and homophobic insults punched him, poured a chemical substance over him, and put a rope around his neck.

Earlier, police had dismissed local media reports that the alleged attack was a hoax, and said Mr Smollett continued to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.

Who are the men arrested?

Two men, Nigerian brothers, were arrested in connection with the incident on Wednesday.

They had worked as Empire extras, sometimes going to the gym with the actor, their lawyer said.

They had been picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare airport, returning from a trip to Nigeria, their lawyer told US media.

“When they first learned about what happened to [Jussie] they were horrified,” Gloria Schmidt told CBS Chicago. “This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

A police spokesman initially said they were treating the unidentified men as “potential suspects” as there was “probable cause” that they may have engaged in a crime. No further details were given.

On Thursday, police had searched their home.

At least one of the brothers worked on Empire, police confirmed.

What does Jussie Smollett say?

Representatives for Smollett have not yet commented on the latest developments in the case.

But recounting the night publicly for the first time, he told US network ABC he had hesitated to call police after it happened because of pride.

“We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak. And I am not weak. And we as a people are not weak.”

When police came he says he left the rope around his neck and was still wearing clothes that smelled of bleach.

“I went down to where it happened and I walked them through exactly what happened.”

The actor said he had just got back to Chicago that day, and after getting home realised there was no food in the house. He said he had ended up at a Subway sandwich shop getting some food – something people have questioned as strange.

He told Good Morning America it was “ridiculous” that people thought he would lie about his reasons for being outside at 2am in freezing temperatures.

“Subway is open 24 hours for a reason, so that when you’re hungry at night and you ain’t got no food, you go to Subway,” he said.

He said he thought he would’ve been doubted less if he had said his alleged attacker “was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black”.

“And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

There were claims he had told police his attackers were wearing the Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats that are associated with President Donald Trump.

“I never said that. I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

But the attackers did say “This is MAGA country”, he said.

The actor said he thought he had been targeted because he was outspoken about President Trump – who when asked about the attack said “That’s horrible, it doesn’t get worse”.

“I don’t know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it,” Mr Smollett said of Mr Trump’s comments.

Writers of Empire have stood behind the actor since the attack – and after reports that plans to write him off the show had led to the hoax, they came out in support of him again.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Smollett claimed in late January that two men had assaulted him, poured bleach on him and placed a noose around his neck, all while allegedly yelling racial and homophobic slurs and shouting, “This is MAGA country!” FYI, Chicago hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1931.

According to TMZ, Smollett also claimed that the suspect was white. The dubious description of the alleged attack provided to local authorities by him led the left to assume the perpetrators were racist white supporters of President Donald Trump and that Trump was therefore to blame.

“This is what happens,” actress Ellen Page said on “The Late Show” earlier this month, referencing the attack. “If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them — you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering — what do you think is gonna happen? … This needs to f–king stop.”

Yet on Thursday local Chicago authorities raided the home of two “persons of interests,” both of them black Nigerian brothers. At the home authorities found “a black face mask hat, an ‘Empire’ script, a phone, receipts, a red hat and bleach,” according to Los Angeles station KCAL.

“Empire” is an ongoing Fox series that stars Smollett. According to the two men’s attorney, Gloria Schmidt, they know the actor and have worked with him on the series.

Identified as actors Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, the suspects were arrested while arriving into the U.S. at the Chicago O’Hare International Airport after having traveled to Nigeria. What’s odd is that they left for their “trip” on the exact same day that Smollett was attacked.

Also strange is that Smollett reportedly follows their fitness-themed Instagram accounts:

HERE’S WHAT YOU’RE MISSING …

Because of the host of coincidences in the case, a rumor began to circulate in the media that the attack had been purposefully staged.

“Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News that police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of ‘Empire,'” Chicago station WLS reported late Thursday evening.

A reporter with Chicago station WBBM claimed the same thing:

However, Guglielmi promptly nixed this rumor in the bud, writing on Twitter, “Media reports anout (sic) the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.”

Fox issued a statement as well.

The brothers’ release from custody Friday does not mean they’re off the hook yet. Authorities confirmed with TMZ that the brothers may have to participate in a lineup soon.

“A Chicago law enforcement source tells us the next step may be a lineup in which Jussie will be asked to identify the culprits. This raises a potential problem because, as we first reported, Jussie initially said his attackers were white and yelled ‘MAGA country,'” TMZ reported.

No additional information had been released by Saturday morning except for this tidbit of juicy intel: Smollett has reportedly hired the same attorney used by notorious liar and conman Michael Cohen. What social media would like to know is why an alleged victim would need an attorney?

The actor who is gay and African-American had alleged that he was attacked by two white men who were wearing the iconic, red, pro-Trump ‘Make American Great Again’ hats after leaving a Chicago club in the early hours of January 29th.

The actor claimed that the two white MAGA hat wearing attackers shouted racial and homophobic epithets and shouted, “This is MAGA country”.

The alleged attack garnered international media attention and was proclaimed by celebrities on social media as evidence of Trump supporters being violent racists.

However, Chicago PD have announced that the two men arrested were actually Nigerian extras on Smollet’s show ‘Empire’.

The Daily Mail UK learned that two men are brothers named Abimbola ‘Abel’ and Olabinjo ‘Ola’ Osundairo.

They were not white or wearing MAGA hats and it is now widely believed that the actor staged the attack to save his failing career.

Two sources with intimate knowledge of the investigation told local Chicago news outlet CBS 2 that it is suspected that Smollett orchestrated that attack himself and involved two other men.

Photos on social media show that the three men were not just working colleagues but close friends.

However, Chicago PD have said that Smollett is cooperating and is still being treated as a victim not a suspect.

Mr. Smollett has reportedly hired Michael Monaco, a high-powered criminal defense attorney, who also represents former Donald Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. Smollett is a frequent critic of the president, and he has claimed the attack was perpetrated by Trump supporters. But does his story have legs?

Chicago police have arrested and then released brothers Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo; reports on February 15 said the brothers were charged with battery, but then Chicago Police tweeted:

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging, and detectives have additional investigative work to complete..”

Misters Osundairo, who live in Chicago, were detained at O’Hare airport on Wednesday after arriving from Nigeria, where they had traveled on the day after the “attack” on Smollett. Chicago police raided their home as well, seizing electronic devices, firearms, and bleach, while serving the search warrant. Smollett had claimed his attackers poured bleach on him.

At least one of the Osundairo brothers worked on Empire with Smollett, and police sources quoted anonymously by Chicagoland Media indicate Smollett is suspected of engaging in a hoax crime with the brothers. The actor followed an Instagram account by one brother, and another of the Osundairos’ social media accounts show one of the brothers exercising in the private gym located in the building where Smollett lives.

Increasing Doubts

With every passing day the claim that MAGA-chanting white men attacked the actor, who is black and gay, all the while shouting racial epithets and homophobic slurs, has lost ground. The odds of this being a real attack on Mr. Smollett continue to rapidly decrease towards zero. Earlier in the week, it’s fair to say that well-informed people of good will could still think that it was indeed an attack and not a hoax. Is that still true? The investigation has revealed facts that now stretch Mr. Smollett’s claim beyond credulity.

Smollett claimed he went for a walk to a local Subway restaurant when two white men started an assault against him by yelling, “Empire fa**ot ni**er” and then punched him in the face, as well as putting a rope around his neck. Later reports to TMZ and other media outlets included the new detail that the attackers said: “This MAGA country ni**er.” Smollett did not report the political nature of the attack to police.

The case attracted skepticism early on, given the unlikely set of coincidences needed to see a couple of violently anti-gay, racist, MAGA-chanting assailants walking around an upscale Chicago neighborhood with bleach and a rope at 2 a.m., all the while the polar vortex dropped temperatures into single digits.

Why, Oh, Why?

In an ABC interview, when asked why he was targeted, Smollett said:

“I come really, really hard against 45 [Trump] … and I don’t hold my tongue.”

There has been speculation online among Chicago journalists that the police had been quite skeptical of Mr. Smollett’s account early on, but have avoided treating him like a suspect due to publicity concerns. The police are under tremendous scrutiny from all corners on this case. Sherrilyn Ifill, President of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said:

“We’re closely watching the Chicago PD’s investigation because first, just last week the Dept was locked into a consent decree by a federal judge to address years of misconduct. The Dept’s handling of the #Smollett attack is an early test for the agency.”

Before announcing the Osundairo brothers’ release, Chicago police tweeted an announcement that a planned press briefing on the case would not take place “in the Empire case as our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of #AuroraShooting.” Aurora, a city an hour’s drive West of Chicago was the scene of a mass shooting on Friday.

As they continue to carefully examine the details of the case, there can be little doubt that Chicago police will get to the bottom of what really happened to Jussie Smollett that night, and who is responsible."

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — State officials say Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program provided the drug nearly 600,000 times during its first year of sales. The Wolf Administration said Friday that more than 83,000 people have purchased medical marijuana at the 45 dispensaries that are up and running. Statewide medical marijuana sales totaled $132 million in the past year.

More than $2 million in state taxes were paid by grower-processors. About 1,000 doctors are currently approved to certify patients for the program. Pennsylvania’s 2016 medical marijuana law permits its use for a list of conditions that include AIDS, autism, cancer, chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Philadelphia prosecutors say they’re fighting an order that gives prison activist Mumia Abu-Jamal a new court hearing because the ruling is so broad it could undo countless other cases. District Attorney Larry Krasner filed a motion Friday outlining his challenge. The issue is now with the Pennsylvania Superior Court. The 64-year-old Abu-Jamal is serving a life sentence for a 1981 police officer’s slaying.

A Philadelphia judge recently granted him a chance at a new appeal because a judge who heard his initial appeal had a passing involvement in the case as Philadelphia district attorney. Krasner says the U.S. Supreme Court has granted new hearings only when there’s a more direct conflict. Abu-Jamal’s lawyer, Judith Ritter, says the city judge’s ruling was not as broad as Krasner maintains and found clear bias against her client.

BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) — With prime Peeps season about to get underway, the Pennsylvania city where they’re “born” is honoring the man who brought marshmallow chicks to the masses. The (Allentown) Morning Call reports that Bethlehem Mayor Robert Donchez proclaimed Friday as “Bob Born Day” in a ceremony at company offices.

Born, now 94, joined his father’s candy business in 1946 and figured out a way to automate production of Peeps, which had been made by hand. Today, Just Born produces about 5.5 million Peeps per day. The city’s proclamation says Peeps are “an iconic symbol of Easter.” Just Born CEO Ross Born, Bob Born’s son, says “we are thankful for his many years of service to Just Born.”

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the Justice Department can’t deny Philadelphia millions in public safety funding because of its status as a “sanctuary city.” The ruling echoes others that block the department from withholding funds to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agencies. City officials have refused to give immigration agents access to prison inmates suspected of being in the country illegally or notify agents before the inmates are released.

In her ruling, U.S. Circuit Court Judge Marjorie Rendell said the Justice Department exceeded its power in attaching those conditions to the approximately $2.5 million in annual grants the city receives. Mayor Jim Kenney said Philadelphia will continue to welcome immigrants, calling the Justice Department’s efforts “an unconscionable attempt to bully the city and its residents.” An email seeking comment was sent to the Justice Department.

NEW YORK (AP) — Bowing to a backlash that had threatened to engulf an already blunder-plagued Academy Awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Friday reversed its decision to present four awards during the commercial breaks of this year’s Oscar broadcast. All 24 categories will be shown live, after all, at the 91st Academy Awards on February 24, the academy announced in a statement. On Monday, the academy had said that the winning speeches for cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short would be aired in a shortened, taped segment during the broadcast.

“Nine days until the showtime, still tweaking the script” the Academy tweeted Friday. The academy did not address whether the change meant extending the show’s length, which organizers have said would be reduced to three hours. The academy’s move to strike awards from the live broadcast was fiercely contested by many of this year’s Oscar nominees, including “Roma” director Alfonso Cuaron and “BlacKkKlansman” filmmaker Spike Lee. The American Society of Cinematographers on Wednesday issued an open-letter to the academy, signed by Martin Scorsese, Brad Pitt and others, calling the plans an insult to the cinematic arts.

CHICAGO (AP) — The investigation into black actor Jussie Smollett’s account of being beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack took a sharp turn Friday when police announced the arrest of two black men they believe assaulted the “Empire” cast member. At least one of the men worked on the TV show, police said. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said authorities had probable cause to believe the suspects committed assault and battery against Smollett. But they had not been charged as of Friday afternoon.

Guglielmi would not comment on a possible motive. Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him. The police spokesman said that there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

COBLESKILL, N.Y. (AP) — Ahoy, beer lovers: A bottle from a 133-year-old shipwreck may yield yeast for a new brew in upstate New York. Biotechnology students at the State University of New York at Cobleskill uncorked a bottle from the shipwrecked SS Oregon on Thursday. Serious Brewing Company of Howes Cave plans to develop a new brew if the students successfully extract yeast.

Bill Felter, of Serious Brewing, acquired the beer from a customer who owns an assortment of artifacts recovered from the Oregon. The ship was en route from Liverpool, England, to New York City with 852 people aboard on March 14, 1886, when it collided with a schooner near Fire Island, New York, and sank. All but one person survived. Last year, an Australian brewer produced beer from yeast recovered from a 220-year-old shipwreck.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

AURORA, Ill. — At least one person was killed and four police officers were wounded when a shooter opened fire at an industrial park in Aurora, Illinois, officials said Friday.

Chris Nelson, spokesman for the Kane County coroner’s office, confirmed one person was killed. City spokesman Clayton Muhammad said four officers were wounded and in stable condition, but did not say if they were shot.

Muhammad also told ABC7 that the suspect had been “neutralized.” He did not elaborate.

Trump declares national emergency to get $8 billion for wall

WASHINGTON — Defiant in the face of a stinging budget defeat, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency Friday to get more federal dollars for his long-promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, relying on a broad interpretation of his powers that was certain to trigger stiff legal challenges.

Bypassing Congress, which approved far less money for his proposed wall than he had sought, Trump said he will use executive action to siphon billions of dollars from federal military construction and counterdrug efforts for the wall. The move drew immediate bipartisan criticism on Capitol Hill and is expected to face rounds of legal challenges.

Trump made the announcement from the Rose Garden, as he claimed illegal immigration was “an invasion of our country.”

In a comment that will surely be used to challenge the legal underpinnings of his emergency declaration, Trump hinted at the political realities behind his action. “I could do the wall over a longer period of time,” he said. “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster.”

Trump’s move followed a rare show of bipartisanship when lawmakers voted Thursday to fund large swaths of the government and avoid a repeat of this winter’s debilitating five-week government shutdown. Trump’s insistence on wall funding has been a flashpoint in his negotiations with Congress for more than two years, as has the resistance of lawmakers in both parties to meeting the president’s request. West Wing aides acknowledged there was insufficient support among Republicans to sustain another shutdown fight, leading Trump to decide to test the limits of his presidential powers.

US military aircraft to deliver more aid to Venezuela border

CARACAS, Venezuela — The Trump administration is sending another large shipment of humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan border in Colombia, for the first time using U.S. military aircraft as it increases pressure on Nicolas Maduro to give up power, according to a State Department email sent to Congress.

The announcement of additional aid comes as the Trump administration on Friday added Venezuela’s oil boss and key intelligence officers to a long list of Maduro loyalists under U.S. financial sanctions.

The 250 tons of food supplies, hygiene kits and nutritional supplements will begin arriving Saturday to the border city of Cucuta, where tons of boxes of emergency aid stamped with the U.S. flag are already warehoused awaiting delivery into Venezuela.

The email sent Friday was provided to The Associated Press by a congressional aide who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

The aid came at the request of opposition leader Juan Guaido, who the U.S. and dozens of other countries have recognized as Venezuela’s rightful leader after President Nicolas Maduro last month was sworn in for a second term widely seen as illegitimate.

NJ attorney general subpoenas Trump’s inaugural committee

NEW YORK — President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee received a sweeping request for financial records this week from prosecutors in New Jersey, the second subpoena the group has received in as many weeks as its fundraising and spending draws mounting scrutiny.

The committee said Friday that it is in contact with the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office, which issued the request for documents on Monday as part of a civil inquiry into how the committee raised and spent $107 million on inaugural events.

The inaugural committee has told the AP its finances were independently audited and that all funds were spent in accordance with the law. Leland Moore, a spokesman for New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, declined to comment.

The inquiry marks the latest in a series of investigations into Trump’s campaign and presidency. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, is investigating whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia and whether the president obstructed the investigation. In a separate case, federal prosecutors in New York have alleged that Trump directed his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to make illegal hush-money payments to two women in a bid to quash potential sex scandals during the 2016 presidential campaign.

From wire sources

Trump denies wrongdoing and has called Mueller’s probe a “witch hunt.” He also has said he was not involved in the operations of the inaugural committee.

‘Everybody suffers too much:’ Nigeria heads to the polls

KANO, Nigeria — As Nigerians prepared to vote for president on Saturday, Sister Meg Odeh looked up from a selection of pineapples laid out at a fume-choked roadside market and considered the fate of her country. She ticked off the sprawling problems facing Africa’s most populous nation: insecurity, poverty, corruption.

“I’m just praying for something good to happen to our people,” the Roman Catholic nun said with a sigh.

More than 84 million voters in this country of some 190 million will head to the polls in what is seen as a close and heated race between 76-year-old President Muhammadu Buhari and top challenger Atiku Abubakar, a billionaire former vice president. Both have pledged to work for a peaceful election even as their supporters, including high-level officials, have caused alarm with vivid warnings against foreign interference and allegations of rigging.

“We love our country and we need our country to be safe from all the violence … and all the nonsense that takes place during election time,” worshipper Amin Muhammad Khalif said as he emerged Friday from prayers in Kano, Nigeria’s second-largest city in a nation largely evenly split between Muslims and Christians.

When Buhari came to power in 2015 he made history with the first defeat of an incumbent president in an election hailed as one of the most transparent and untroubled ever in Nigeria, which has seen deadly post-vote violence in the past."

Jussie Smollett has lawyered up. After news spread that Chicago police were treating his report of a hate crime as a hoax, he has retained the council of notorious high-profile defense attorney Michael Monico. This lawyer has represented other notorious defendants like Michael Cohen and a Cabinet member under President G.W. Bush. He describes himself on his website as ""the premier criminal defense attorney in the country."" Mr. Monico specializes in ""white collar, health care fraud, antitrust, public corruption, mail, wire and securities fraud, and foreign corrupt practices investigations throughout the United States and around the globe."" Quite an ominous sign for a man clinging to his own victimhood to pick a criminal defense attorney. Smollett has already purchased services from the P.R. firm Sunshine Sachs, which manages the legal scandals of other clients like Harvey Weinstein. The firm has taken over making public statements on its newest celebrity client's behalf. Most likely at its direction, he has scrubbed all of his social media accounts of any personal mention of the alleged incident.

Chicago police released the Nigerian brothers late Friday evening after dropping battery charges against them. The brothers, one of whom appeared as an extra on Jussie Smollett's television show, were picked up late Wednesday night when their flight landed at O'Hare airport. They were returning from their home country of Nigeria, which they had departed to hours after Jussie reported the ""attack."" While the two were in police custody, law enforcement raided their house and took a list of items including five containers of bleach, computers, firearms, and a ""red hat."" The pair was officially arrested Friday morning, and investigators spent over 12 hours straight interrogating them. The Chicago Police Department released this official statement upon their release: Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released...and detectives have additional investigative work to complete. This ""additional investigative work"" apparently sent the CPD to Jussie Smollett's residence, where they seized a container of bleach. It is unknown whether this was after a warrant was issued or Smollett willingly complied with their request after advice from his new counsel. Chicago police confirmed to Fox News that information that was discovered during the questioning of the Nigerian brothers prompted this search. Jussie and law enforcement's actions are no longer disguised as Smollett being a victim of a hate crime. All signs are pointing toward a crumbling empire, arguably more exciting to watch than the TV drama he stars in. Image: Dominick D via Flickr."

The 2 men who were arrested, then released Friday night, in the Jussie Smollett case are pro-LGBTQ and anti-Trump, which has people on the ""Empire"" set scratching their heads.

We've spoken with ""Empire"" cast and crew, and they say Ola and Abel Osundairo do not fit the profile of racists and homophobes -- not even close. As we reported, both men have been extras on ""Empire"" for years and both are friendly with Jussie, and Abel is especially close to him. We're told Jussie would frequently approach the brothers on set and chat about health and fitness.

Our Empire sources say Abel especially is an ally of the LGBTQ community, and neither have ever said anything positive about Trump. They're both big Obama fans.

We're told Abel worked as an ""Empire"" extra as recently as a month ago. They're considered family on the set ... well-known and well-liked by cast and crew.

The folks we've spoken with say they find it impossible to believe Ola and Abel have the DNA of criminals who would carry out the acts that Jussie describes -- and obviously cops now believe that as well.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O’Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett’s account.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on “Empire” and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of “Empire” released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was “patently ridiculous,” and that they continue to stand behind him.

Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted the news this morning (16 February) and confirmed that new evidence has been found in relation to the attack.

Guglielmi wrote: “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

Last month, Smollett alleged that he was attacked in a shocking racist and homophobic assault, with police later confirming that the incident was being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Smollett gained fame for his portrayal of musician Jamal Lyon on Empire, which began in 2015. The same year, he came out as gay.

The actor was allegedly attacked by two men who yelled racist and homophobic abuse at him in Chicago on January 29.

In an emotional appearance on Good Morning America, the star said he was “forever changed” by the alleged attack.

“I will never be the man who this didn’t happen to,” he said.

“I am forever changed and I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

However, earlier this week police denied reports that suggested the star may have staged the attack to allay fears he was being written out of Empire.

In a statement, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.”

Writers of Empire also released a statement denying Smollett was being written out of the show."

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on “Empire,” Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man’s job was.

Police earlier this week said there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation. MKH

BEDFORD, N.H. -- William Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts who two years ago ran for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket, has moved closer to becoming the first Republican to announce a challenge to President Donald Trump in the 2020 primaries.

Speaking Friday at a breakfast in New Hampshire, Weld said he has created a presidential exploratory committee. He blasted Trump for leaving the nation in ""grave peril.""

Fiscally conservative but socially liberal, the 73-year-old Weld ran on the Libertarian ticket with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. But he re-registered as a Republican last month, and on Friday in New Hampshire said he has created a presidential exploratory committee.

Weld said Trump's priorities are skewed toward promoting himself and that he is ""simply too unstable"" to carry out the duties of his job.

If Weld decides to run, it would make Trump the first incumbent president since George H.W. Bush in 1992 to face a notable primary challenge. Other Republicans eyeing a presidential campaign include former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan.

N.J. subpoenas Trump inaugural planner

NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump's inaugural committee received a sweeping request for financial records this week from prosecutors in New Jersey, the second subpoena the group has received in as many weeks as its fundraising and spending draws mounting scrutiny.

The committee said Friday that it is in contact with the New Jersey attorney general's office, which issued the request for documents on Monday as part of a civil inquiry into how the committee raised and spent $107 million on inaugural events.

The inaugural committee has told the AP its finances were independently audited and that all funds were spent in accordance with the law.

Leland Moore, a spokesman for New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, declined to comment.

The subpoena, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, resembles the wide-ranging request for documents the committee received last week from federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who are investigating, among other potential crimes, whether foreigners illegally contributed to the inaugural events.

The latest subpoena contains similar language but specifically asks for records relating to fundraising events and ""solicitations"" conducted in New Jersey. It also requests copies of ledgers, tax forms, contracts and ""all documents related to any benefits provided to donors.""

CHICAGO -- Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting Empire actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

'Sanctuary' ruling favors Philadelphia

PHILADELPHIA -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the Justice Department can't deny Philadelphia millions of dollars in public safety funding because of its status as a ""sanctuary city.""

The ruling echoes others that block the department from withholding funds to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.

City officials have refused to give immigration agents access to prison inmates suspected of being in the country illegally or notify agents before the inmates are released.

In her ruling, U.S. Circuit Court Judge Marjorie Rendell said the Justice Department exceeded its power in attaching those conditions to the approximately $2.5 million in annual grants the city receives.

Mayor Jim Kenney said Philadelphia will continue to welcome immigrants, calling the Justice Department's efforts ""an unconscionable attempt to bully the city and its residents.""

The men, who were arrested on Wednesday, were released on Friday ""due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations. Detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" said Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi, reports cnn.com.

The men arrested were the same two who police previously said were being viewed as ""potential suspects"", police spokesperson Tom Ahern said.

Earlier, Guglielmi said the two Nigerian brothers were being treated as ""potential suspects"" and that there was ""probable cause that they may have been involved"".

At that time police did not say precisely what the brothers were accused of or what the alleged crime might have been.

The two men and Smollett had some kind of previous affiliation, a police source said, without providing further detail.

Smollett, one of the stars of the TV drama Empire, told authorities he was attacked on January 29 by the men who used ""racial and homophobic slurs"" on him.

There was also a brief struggle, Smollett told police. One attacker had allegedly put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, before running away.

Police has also searched the apartment of two other men who were apprehended at the Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday night, but they were not considered suspects at that time.

One of the brothers had appeared on Empire, according to the police.

Authorities previously released surveillance images of two silhouetted figures in the area of the attack and said they were wanted for questioning.

AURORA, Ill. (AP) - The man who opened fire and killed five co-workers including the plant manager, human resources manager and an intern working his first day at a suburban Chicago manufacturing warehouse, took a gun he wasn't supposed to have to a job he was about to lose.

Right after learning Friday that he was being fired from his job of 15 years at the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, Gary Martin pulled out a gun and began shooting, killing the three people in the room with him and two others just outside and wounding a sixth employee, police said Saturday.

Martin shot and wounded five of the first officers to get to the scene, including one who didn't even make it inside the sprawling warehouse in Aurora, Illinois, a city of 200,000 about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Chicago.

After that flurry of shots and with officers from throughout the region streaming in to help, he ran off and hid in the back of the building, where officers found him about an hour later and killed him during an exchange of gunfire, police said.

""He was probably waiting for us to get to him there,"" Aurora police Lt. Rick Robertson said. ""It was just a very short gunfight and it was over, so he was basically in the back waiting for us and fired upon us and our officers fired.""

The 21-year-old Northern Illinois University student was on his first day as an intern in human resources at Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora and attended the fateful meeting where the gunman was fired and then started shooting.

Jay Wehner said his nephew grew up about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Aurora in Sheridan and was expected to graduate from Northern Illinois University in May with a degree in human resource management. He was on the dean's list at NIU's business college.

Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, said that ""the past two months have been grueling for my family and therefore it is in the best interest of my family that I withdraw my name from consideration.""

She was a Fox News Channel reporter with little foreign policy experience when she joined the State Department as spokeswoman less than two years ago.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he respected Nauert's decision and that she had performed her duties as a senior member of his team ""with unequalled excellence.""

The State Department said Trump would announce a nominee for the position ""soon.""

Potential privacy lapse found in Americans' 2010 census data

WASHINGTON (AP) - An internal team at the Census Bureau found that basic personal information collected from more than 100 million Americans during the 2010 head count could be reconstructed from obscured data, but with lots of mistakes, a top agency official disclosed Saturday.

The age, gender, location, race and ethnicity for 138 million people were potentially vulnerable. So far, however, only internal hacking teams have discovered such details at possible risk, and no outside groups are known to have grabbed data intended to remain private for 72 years, chief scientist John Abowd told a scientific conference.

The Census Bureau is now scrapping its old data shielding technique for a state-of-the-art method that Abowd claimed is far better than Google's or Apple's.

Some former agency chiefs fear the potential privacy problem will add to the worries that people will avoid answering or lie on the once-every-10-year survey because of the Trump administration's attempt to add a much-debated citizenship question.

The Supreme Court on Friday announced that it would rule on that proposed question, which has been criticized for being political and not properly tested in the field. The census count is hugely important, helping with the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and distribution of billions of dollars in federal money.

Chicago police: Jussie Smollett assault case has 'shifted'

CHICAGO (AP) - Chicago police say ""the trajectory of the investigation"" into the reported attack on Jussie Smollett has shifted and they want to conduct another interview with the ""Empire"" actor.

Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers they had detained for questioning earlier in the week.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago : ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant early on Jan. 29. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police have been unable to find surveillance video of the attack.

Vatican defrocks former US cardinal McCarrick for sex abuse

VATICAN CITY (AP) - Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has been found guilty by the Vatican of sex abuse and defrocked, as calls rose Saturday for Pope Francis to reveal what he knew about the once-powerful American prelate's apparently decades-long predatory sexual behavior.

The announcement Saturday, delivered in uncharacteristically blunt language for the Vatican, meant that the 88-year-old McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., becomes the highest-ranking churchman and the first cardinal to be punished by dismissal from the clerical state, or laicization.

He was notified Friday of the decision, which was upheld upon his appeal and approved by Pope Francis.

The pontiff next week leads a summit of bishops from around the world who have been summoned to Rome help him grapple with the entrenched problems of clerical sex abuse and the systematic cover-ups by the Catholic church's hierarchy.

Decades of revelations about priests who have sexually preyed on minors and their bosses who shuffled abusive clergy from parish to parish instead of removing them from access to children have shaken the faith of many Catholics. They also threaten the moral authority of Francis and even the survival of his papacy.

Storm-lashed South Carolina reassesses global warming's role

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - When he took the job 15 years ago, Horry County Emergency Manager Randy Webster figured his biggest disasters would be wind and surge rolling over his county's beaches, South Carolina's top tourist destination.

Instead, his worries have shifted inland, where rivers overflowing their banks have caused two massive floods in three years.

""We're getting into this sort of unknown territory,"" Webster said. ""We typically in emergency management have some point of reference to work with. Two floods like this - it's unheard of.""

Scientists say the Earth's warming climate means more heavy rainfall over short periods of time, and that translates to larger, more ferocious storms on the scale of 2017's Hurricane Harvey in Texas or 2018's Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas. Florence dumped six months' worth of rain on the Carolinas in the course of just a few days.

The growing realization that such events are going to become more common as the result of global warming is forcing Webster and other state officials to revisit how they prepare for and respond to natural disasters.

Dem presidential candidates introducing themselves to voters

Five Democratic senators vying for their party's nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 fanned out across the country Saturday to campaign and meet voters.

Kamala Harris of California spent her second straight day in the pivotal early-voting state of South Carolina, holding a town hall meeting in Columbia, the capital. Also visiting the state was Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who met with an estimated 800 voters in Greenville before heading to Georgia - an unusual early stop for a White House hopeful but one that signals Democratic hopes to make inroads in the South.

Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York both focused on New Hampshire. Booker made his first visit to there since joining the race earlier this month, holding a question-and-answer session with more than 400 voters in Portsmouth.

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, meanwhile, made her own uncommon choice for early campaigning by visiting Wisconsin before heading to Iowa, home to the nation's first caucus.

And a Democratic heavyweight who's yet to address his 2020 plans, former Vice President Joe Biden, made his own high-profile appearance at the Munich Security Conference.

Tear gas, hate speech marks 14th yellow vest protest

PARIS (AP) - Police fired tear gas and brought in water cannons and a horse brigade to disperse several thousand yellow vest protesters Saturday massed near a Paris landmark at the end of a march through the French capital, the 14th straight weekend of demonstrations.

Anti-Semitic remarks hurled by a few at a noted philosopher on the protesters' route were the bitter finale to a day of tension.

Acrid clouds of tear gas filled the esplanade of Les Invalides monument, obscuring the gold dome that crowns the monument housing Napoleon's tomb.

Tension also marked demonstrations in other cities.

In Rouen, in Normandy, a car blocked by demonstrators pushed through the crowd, slightly injuring four people, the all-news channel BFMTV reported. Police used tear gas and water cannon in Bordeaux, a stronghold of the yellow vest movement, and other cities on the 14th straight Saturday of protests. Another demonstration in the capital was planned for Sunday to mark three months since the movement held its first nationwide protests Nov. 17.

Gone in a New York minute: How the Amazon deal fell apart

NEW YORK (AP) - In early November, word began to leak that Amazon was serious about choosing New York to build a giant new campus. The city was eager to lure the company and its thousands of high-paying tech jobs, offering billions in tax incentives and lighting the Empire State Building in Amazon orange.

Even Governor Andrew Cuomo got in on the action: ""I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes,"" he joked at the time.

Then Amazon made it official: It chose the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens to build a $2.5 billion campus that could house 25,000 workers, in addition to new offices planned for northern Virginia. Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Democrats who have been political adversaries for years, trumpeted the decision as a major coup after edging out more than 230 other proposals.

But what they didn't expect was the protests, the hostile public hearings and the disparaging tweets that would come in the next three months, eventually leading to Amazon's dramatic Valentine's Day breakup with New York.

Immediately after Amazon's Nov. 12 announcement, criticism started to pour in. The deal included $1.5 billion in special tax breaks and grants for the company, but a closer look at the total package revealed it to be worth at least $2.8 billion. Some of the same politicians who had signed a letter to woo Amazon were now balking at the tax incentives."

The men, who were arrested on Wednesday, were released on Friday “due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations. Detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” said Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi, reports cnn.com.

The men arrested were the same two who police previously said were being viewed as “potential suspects”, police spokesperson Tom Ahern said.

Earlier Guglielmi said the two Nigerian brothers were being treated as “potential suspects” and that there was “probable cause that they may have been involved”.

At that time police did not say precisely what the brothers were accused of or what the alleged crime might have been.

The two men and Smollett had some kind of previous affiliation, a police source said, without providing further detail.

Smollett, one of the stars of the TV drama “Empire”, told authorities he was attacked on January 29 by the men who used “racial and homophobic slurs” on him.

There was also a brief struggle, Smollett told police. One attacker had allegedly put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, before running away.

Police has also searched apartment of two other men who were apprehended at the Chicago O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday night, but they were not considered suspects at that time.

One of the brothers had appeared on “Empire,” according to police.

Authorities previously released surveillance images of two silhouetted figures in the area of the attack and said they were wanted for questioning.

The investigation into black actor Jussie Smollett's account of being beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack took a sharp turn Friday when Chicago police announced the arrest of two men they believe assaulted the ""Empire"" cast member.

But both were released hours later without being charged. One of the men worked on the TV show, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said authorities had cause to believe the suspects committed assault and battery against Smollett.

Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

The two suspects, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said.

Guglielmi said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived.

The police spokesman's comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax.

Police said those reports were unconfirmed. And the producers of ""Empire"" disputed as ""patently ridiculous"" news reports that Smollett's character was being written out of the show before the attack.

Smollett, 36, has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. He said police also are contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

Perry and 'Pirates' star are engaged

There's a new reason for Katy Perry to sing with joy.

The pop star is engaged to actor Orlando Bloom, whom she first started dating in early 2016.

The ""Firework"" singer and the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star each shared a selfie to their Instagram pages showing Perry wearing a flower-shaped ring.

""Lifetimes,"" Bloom captioned the photo, while Perry wrote, ""full bloom.""

Perry's mom, meanwhile, shared additional photos to her Facebook page, writing in a since-deleted post, ""Look who got engaged on Valentine's Day,"" according to People.

Bloom, 42, and the ""Roar"" artist, 34, were first romantically linked in January 2016. They broke up the following year, before rumors emerged in early 2018 that they'd rekindled their romance.

Perry then confirmed last April that she was ""spoken for"" relationship-wise during a red-carpet interview with ""Entertainment Tonight.""

The singer was married to actor Russell Brand from 2010 to 2012, while Bloom was married to supermodel Miranda Kerr from 2010 to 2013.

Rapper hid British birth for fear of ICE

The Atlanta-based rapper 21 Savage said in an interview aired Friday that he didn't talk about his British citizenship before because he didn't want to get deported.

The Grammy-nominated artist, whose given name is She'yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, was arrested Feb. 3. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement called it a targeted operation. He was released from custody Wednesday on a $100,000 bond.

Abraham-Joseph, 26, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" he had no idea what a visa was when his mother brought him to the U.S. at 7 years old. His visa expired in 2006.

""I knew I wasn't born here,"" he said. ""But I didn't know like, what that meant as far as when I transitioned into an adult, how it was going to affect my life.""

The rapper said he wasn't hiding the fact that he isn't a U.S. citizen, but ""I didn't want to get deported so I'm not going to just come out and say, 'Hey ... I wasn't born here.'""

He applied for a new visa in 2017, and his case is pending.

Attorney Alex Spiro said on ""Good Morning America"" that he believes Abraham-Joseph was targeted ""because he's both a celebrity and they can use this as a way to send a message and also, perhaps, because of his music.""

""There's people that are just totally forgotten that exist in these detention centers,"" Spiro said, adding, ""I'm hoping people like 21 Savage will bring light to these issues and help the people that are forgotten.""

By Gabriella Borter

Feb 15 (Reuters) - Suspects arrested in connection with an alleged racist and homophobic assault on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago were released on Friday, police said.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O'Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,"" Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett's account.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on ""Empire"" and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of ""Empire"" released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was ""patently ridiculous,"" and that they continue to stand behind him.

Cops previously said that the pair were persons of interest after they were recognised from CCTV footage in the area where Smollett said two men jumped him at 2am.

NEW EVIDENCE FROM INTERROGATIONS

The development comes after Jussie hit back at claims he faked the Chicago attack because he was being written out of Empire.

Jussie, 36, told how he was punched and kicked by white attackers shouting ""This is MAGA country"" (Make America Great Again) in the early hours of January 29.

The actor, who is black and gay and who plays gay character Jamal Lyon in Empire, said the men also called him a “f***ot”.

After the Nigerian brothers were arrested, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News they were not involved in the attack.

“It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.

“This is someone that they know, this is someone that they’ve worked with,” she said.

“So they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

In the wake of the assault, Jussie has been hit by claims that the attack was faked.

'NO SIGNS ATTACK WAS A HOAX'

The police spokesman said that there is ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

Speaking out about the hoax claims, Jussie said: ""I'm p***ed off. It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks.""

Holding back tears, he said:""Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It's the truth.

""Then it became a thing of, like, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth. You don't even want to see the truth.""

The performer went back to work two weeks ago for the first time since two masked men attacked him and put a rope around his neck in Chicago, USA, in January.

The Chicago Sun Times reported that he told the crowd at the Troubador in West Hollywood: ""The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK.""

""I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.""

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Jussie walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck.

However, his phone records were rejected by police for being heavily redacted’ in the investigation into his brutal racist attack.

TMZ reported that the PDF file the 35-year-old star submitted could have been ""manipulated"" - claiming that numbers may have been added or deleted - although police told the publication that there is no evidence that the file had been altered.

NEW YORK - Suspects arrested in connection with an alleged racist and homophobic assault on Empire actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago were released on Friday, police said.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the Chicago Police Department said in an email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesperson for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O’Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognised from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on 29 January.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama Empire, caused an uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett’s account.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

Two suspects that were arrested in connection to an attack on Jussie Smollett have now been released by police.

Chicago Police Department confirmed on Friday that those in question have been released and are no longer being classified as ‘suspects’ in relation to the hate crime reported by the Empire actor.

Police issued a statement to Reuters that said: ‘Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.’

The publication claims that police refused to confirm whether the suspects released were the two brothers arrested in connection to the attack on Wednesday.

A spokesperson for the police said two Nigerian brothers were being treated as ‘potential suspects’ and that detectives had ‘probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime’.

Authorities have not indicated exactly what the brothers are accused of or what the alleged crime might have been.

Jussie was attacked in Chicago at the end of January, with the incident now considered to be a hate crime as the attackers had hurled racial and homophobic abuse at the star.

Reports claimed the attackers ‘beat the actor up, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him.’

TMZ previously reported that Jussie had been questioned again by police, as well as another man, an actor who had also appeared on Empire.

A rep for Jussie told Metro.co.uk: ‘Jussie answered routine questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to be cooperative.’

The attack was later referred to as a hate crime (Picture: Instagram)

In his first TV interview given since the attack, Jussie told Good Morning America he is ‘pissed off’ as he has had to face doubts over the attack and claims he ‘fabricated details’ of the incident.

He said: ‘You know, at first it was a thing of, “Listen if I tell the truth, then that’s it, because it’s the truth,” then it became a thing of, like, “Oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth.”

‘And then it became a thing of, like, “Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.”’

Chicago-based outlets had also reported speculation that the attack had been ‘staged’.

A police spokesman addressed such claims and said in a statement: ‘While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax.

‘The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.’

Update: Reports in Chicago quote unidentified Chicago Police sources as saying they suspect Jussie Smollett paid the two men who were questioned Friday to stage the attack.

Smollett’s lawyer has denounced the stories in a statement, reports The Blast:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement says. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

EMPIRE CAST MEMBER-ATTACK

Chicago police: Jussie Smollett assault case has ‘shifted’

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police say “the trajectory of the investigation” into the reported attack on Jussie Smollett has shifted and they want to conduct another interview with the “Empire” actor.

Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers they had detained for questioning earlier in the week.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi issued a statement saying: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant early on Jan. 29. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police have been unable to find surveillance video of the attack.

A spokeswoman for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Guglielmi’s statement.

UN AMBASSADOR

State Department: Nauert out as pick for UN ambassador

WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department says Heather Nauert, picked by President Donald Trump to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations but never officially nominated, has withdrawn.

Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, said that “the past two months have been grueling for my family and therefore it is in the best interest of my family that I withdraw my name from consideration.”

She was a Fox News Channel reporter with little foreign policy experience when she joined the State Department as spokeswoman less than two years ago.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he respected Nauert’s decision and that she had performed her duties as a senior member of his team “with unequalled excellence.”

The State Department said Trump would announce a nominee for the position “soon.”

CENSUS PRIVACY

Potential privacy lapse found in Americans’ 2010 census data

WASHINGTON (AP) — A top Census Bureau official says an internal agency team found that basic personal information collected from more than 100 million Americans during the 2010 head count could be reconstructed from encrypted data — but with lots of mistakes.

So far, this privacy vulnerability has only been captured by internal hacking teams, and no outside groups are known to have grabbed data that’s supposed to be private for 72 years.

The agency’s chief scientist, John Abowd, tells a scientific conference in Washington that the data vulnerability potentially affects 138 million people.

The Census Bureau is scrapping its old data shielding technique for a state-of-the-art method that Abowd says is far better than Google’s or Apple’s.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — The archbishop of Boston says the Vatican’s decision to defrock former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick is an important step for “administering justice” for McCarrick’s crimes.

Cardinal Sean O’Malley issued a statement Saturday after the announcement that McCarrick had been found guilty by the Vatican of sex abuse, including while hearing confession.

O’Malley says church leaders “must enforce accountability for cardinals and bishops.”

O’Malley says his archdiocese is committed to taking reports of abuse seriously, saying it has a “moral responsibility” to be always vigilant.

AP-US-PREPARING-FOR-FLOODS

Climate change means more floods, great and localized

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The growing realization that ever-more ferocious storms are becoming more common as the result of global warming is forcing government officials to revisit how they respond to natural disasters.

In South Carolina late last year, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster created a special floodwater commission. The group will be tasked with figuring out how to better combat flooding unleashed by hurricanes, rising ocean levels and other rain systems upstream that send rivers and creeks over their banks on the way to the Atlantic Ocean.

Larry Larson is a former director and senior policy adviser for the Association of State Floodplain Managers. He says officials need to start using forecast tools that predict several different scenarios depending on temperature rise, rather than relying on flood maps based on past events.

ELECTION 2020-CAMPAIGN RDP-THE LATEST

The Latest: Gillibrand accuses Trump of dividing people

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in her second day of campaigning in New Hampshire, issued a rebuke of what she called President Donald Trump’s divisive language.

The New York senator and Democratic presidential candidate told a crowd of about 450 people Saturday at Dartmouth College — her alma mater — that the president’s worst offense since he was elected has been to “dehumanize people” and create a climate of fear and hatred, especially toward immigrants.

Gillibrand said Trump wants Americans “to be afraid of one another.” She insisted “that’s not who we are.”

Gillibrand, who took questions from the audience, said she favors a single-payer health care system modeled on Medicare and would take on climate change by incentivizing the creation of renewable energy. She added that she was optimistic that “common sense” gun laws would pass now that young voters are calling for change.

AMAZON-HQ-VANISHED DEAL

Gone in a New York minute: How the Amazon deal fell apart

NEW YORK (AP) — When Amazon chose the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens to build a $2.5 billion campus that could house 25,000 workers, New York’s top brass saw it as a major coup.

But what they didn’t expect was the protests, the hostile public hearings and the disparaging tweets that would come in the next three months, eventually leading to Amazon’s dramatic Valentine’s Day breakup with the city.

The list of grievances was long: the deal was done secretively; Amazon didn’t need nearly $3 billion in tax incentives; and rising rents could push people out of the neighborhood.

City officials and union leaders were talking to Amazon until the last minute. Then the company surprised even the city’s mayor by announcing they were ditching New York in a blog post.

ALL-STAR WEEKEND-THE LATEST

The Latest: OKC’s Diallo leaps over Shaq to win dunk contest

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Oklahoma City’s Hamidou Diallo is the NBA’s slam dunk champion.

Going over Shaquille O’Neal in the first round, then getting a boost from rapper Quavo in the finale, Diallo soared to the crown by topping New York’s Dennis Smith Jr.

Diallo topped Smith 88-85 in the finale. Charlotte’s Miles Bridges and Atlanta’s John Collins went out in the first round.

Smith leapfrogged Miami’s Dwyane Wade and took a lob from Stephen Curry to give himself a chance with his last dunk, getting a perfect score from the judges — and a round of boos from the crowd, many of whom weren’t that impressed.

That left Diallo as the night’s final participant.

Diallo pulled off a dunk that will be talked about for years in the first round — dunking over O’Neal, hanging on the rim by his elbow, then tearing open his jersey to reveal a “Superman” shirt underneath. And then he plucked the ball from Quavo as he went airborne for the dunk that sealed the title.

FRANCE-PROTESTS

Scattered yellow vest protests against Macron, anti-Semitism

PARIS (AP) — Yellow vest protesters are holding scattered demonstrations around Paris and the rest of France amid waning support for their movement.

A few hundred people gathered peacefully Saturday on the Champs-Elysees, the stage of past rioting. This marks the 14th straight weekend of demonstrations by a movement that started against fuel taxes and grew to a mass movement against President Emmanuel Macron and his pro-business policies.

Another protest planned later Saturday was organized to denounce anti-Semitism, after recent anti-Semitic vandal attacks that raised national concern. Some yellow vest protesters have expressed racist views online and on the sidelines of protests, and French authorities fear the weekend protests are radicalizing.

Polls suggest public support is fading for the weekend protests, which often descend into shocking violence between demonstrators and police.

AURORA, Ill. (AP) — A 15-year employee being fired from a suburban Chicago manufacturing company started shooting Friday, killing five co-workers and wounding five police officers before he was killed by police, authorities said.

Aurora, Illinois, Police Chief Kristen Ziman said 45-year-old Gary Martin “was being terminated” before he started shooting at the Henry Pratt Co. — which makes valves for industrial purposes — in the city about 40 miles (65 kilometres) west of Chicago.

She told a news conference that in addition to the five employees killed, a sixth worker was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life threatening. A sixth police officer suffered a knee injury while officers were searching the building.

Ziman said officers arrived within four minutes of receiving reports of the shooting and were fired upon as soon as they entered the 29,000-square-foot manufacturing warehouse.

Police said they did not know the gunman’s motive.

Trump declaration faces uncertain fate in coming court fight

WASHINGTON (AP) — Let the lawsuits begin.

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency along the southern border Friday and predicted his administration would end up defending it all the way to the Supreme Court.

That might have been the only thing Trump said Friday that produced near-universal agreement.

The American Civil Liberties Union announced its intention to sue less than an hour after the White House released the text of Trump’s declaration that the “current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency.”

Non-profit watchdog group Public Citizen filed suit later, urging the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to “bar Trump and the U.S. Department of Defence from using the declaration and funds appropriated for other purposes to build a border wall.”

Nigeria delays election until Feb. 23 over ‘challenges’

KANO, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria’s electoral commission delayed the presidential election until Feb. 23, making the announcement a mere five hours before polls were set to open Saturday. It cited unspecified “challenges” amid reports that voting materials had not been delivered to all parts of the country.

Residents of Africa’s most populous nation and largest democracy will soon wake up to outrage. Many had relocated for the chance to vote.

“This was a difficult decision to take but necessary for successful delivery of the elections and the consolidation of our democracy,” commission chairman Mahmood Yakubu told reporters in the capital, Abuja. He said more details would be released during an afternoon briefing.

A review of logistics, along with the determination to hold a credible vote, led the commission to conclude that going ahead with the election as planned was “no longer feasible,” he said.

Nigeria also postponed the previous presidential election in 2015 because of deadly insecurity in the northeast, which remains under threat from Islamic extremists.

Chicago police release 2 men questioned in Smollett case

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

“The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

Court filing: Manafort faces more than 19 years in prison

WASHINGTON (AP) — Paul Manafort, the one-time chairman of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, could spend more than 19 years in prison on tax and bank fraud charges, prosecutors said Friday.

Court documents filed by special counsel Robert Mueller’s office reveal that Manafort faces possibly the lengthiest prison term in the Russia investigation. The 69-year-old Manafort is also at serious risk of spending the rest of his life in prison if a federal judge imposes a sentence within federal guidelines.

The potential sentence stems from Manafort’s conviction last year on eight felony counts related to an elaborate scheme to conceal from tax authorities the millions of dollars he earned overseas from Ukrainian political consulting. It is one of two criminal cases pending against Manafort in which he faces prison time.

Manafort, who led Trump’s campaign for months during the 2016 presidential campaign, is not charged with any crimes directly related to Russian election interference, the thrust of Mueller’s probe. But prosecutors have recently revealed that they remain deeply interested in his contacts during and after the campaign with an associate the FBI says has ties to Russian intelligence.

In a 27-page court filing Friday, prosecutors did not recommend a precise sentence for Manafort, but they agreed with a calculation by federal probation officials that his crimes deserve a punishment of between 19.5 and 24.5 years. They also lay out in great detail for U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III how they say Manafort’s greed drove him to disregard American law.

APNewsBreak: Allred contacted authorities about R Kelly tape

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorney Gloria Allred told The Associated Press Friday she has contacted law enforcement about concerns one of her clients may be the person in a VHS tape recently given to Chicago prosecutors that purportedly shows R&B star R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl.

Allred, who represents multiple R. Kelly accusers, some of whom haven’t come forward publicly, spoke a day after attorney Michael Avenatti said he gave Chicago prosecutors the video.

“I’ve made law enforcement in a different jurisdiction (other than Chicago) aware of my concerns that it may, in fact, be my client and I want to protect her privacy,” Allred told the AP in a telephone interview.

Kelly has been dogged for decades with allegations of sexual misconduct. Through his lawyers, he has consistently denied them. His current attorney, Steve Greenberg, told the AP Allred’s comments were “speculative.”

Greenberg also said he wasn’t aware of any moves afoot to charge Kelly with anything.

Kaepernick, Eric Reid settle collusion grievances with NFL

NEW YORK (AP) — With a public hearing looming and the threat of owners and league officials facing depositions, the NFL settled collusion cases brought by Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid.

The league, about to celebrate its 100th season, faced criticism from all sides thanks to the protest movement started by Kaepernick. Many Kaepernick supporters wanted to see him back on the field, while other fans said they wouldn’t watch if the league allowed players to protest during the national anthem.

The league and Kaepernick’s lawyer sent out statements Friday saying that “the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances” and that a confidentiality agreement would prevent either side from commenting further.

It remains unclear if the NFL admitted wrongdoing or how much money Reid, Kaepernick or others may have received. Considering the lost salary both players claimed and legal costs, the settlement could have climbed into the tens of millions of dollars.

“For the past several months, counsel for Mr. Kaepernick and Mr. Reid have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL,” the league statement said. “As a result of those discussions, the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances. The resolution of this matter is subject to a confidentiality agreement so there will be no further comment by any party.”

Payless ShoeSource to shutter all of its remaining US stores

NEW YORK (AP) — Payless ShoeSource is shuttering all of its 2,100 remaining stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, joining a list of iconic names like Toys R Us and Bon-Ton that have closed down in the last year.

The Topeka, Kansas-based chain said Friday it will hold liquidation sales starting Sunday and wind down its e-commerce operations. All of the stores will remain open until at least the end of March and the majority will remain open until May.

The debt-burdened chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2017, closing hundreds of stores as part of its reorganization.

At the time, it had over 4,400 stores in more than 30 countries. It remerged from restructuring four months later with about 3,500 stores and eliminated more than $435 million in debt.

The company said in an email that the liquidation doesn’t affect its franchise operations or its Latin American stores, which remain open for business as usual. It lists 18,000 employees worldwide.

Academy reverses plans, will air all awards live at Oscars

NEW YORK (AP) — Bowing to a backlash that had threatened to engulf an already blunder-plagued Academy Awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Friday reversed its decision to present four awards during the commercial breaks of this year’s Oscar broadcast.

All 24 categories will be shown live, after all, at the 91st Academy Awards on February 24, the academy announced in a statement. On Monday, the academy had said that the winning speeches for cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short would be aired in a shortened, taped segment during the broadcast.

“Nine days until the showtime, still tweaking the script” the Academy tweeted Friday.

The academy did not address whether the change meant extending the show’s length, which organizers have said would be reduced to three hours.

The academy’s move to strike awards from the live broadcast was fiercely contested by many of this year’s Oscar nominees, including “Roma” director Alfonso Cuaron and “BlacKkKlansman” filmmaker Spike Lee. The American Society of Cinematographers on Wednesday issued an open-letter to the academy, signed by Martin Scorsese, Brad Pitt and others, calling the plans an insult to the cinematic arts.

Snow too thick to plow keeps skiers from California resorts

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Winter weather enveloping California’s mountains for a fourth straight day Friday kept skiers from hitting the slopes at the start of the Presidents Day holiday weekend, with snow so deep that plows could not tackle it and cities scrambled to find places to pile it.

Several routes to the ski mecca of Lake Tahoe shut down, including about 70 miles (110 kilometres) of Interstate 80 from Colfax, California, to the Nevada state line.

I-80 was reopened to passenger vehicles Friday evening.

Chains were required for travel in many other parts of the towering Sierra Nevada.

“All avid skiers are itching to get out on the mountain, but the roads are pretty treacherous right now,” said Kevin Cooper, marketing director for Lake Tahoe TV.

Whitehead']",,"['smollett', 'case', 'jussie', 'reports', 'curious', 'report', 'false', 'attack', 'arrest', 'crimes', 'victims', 'phone', 'cases']","Let me just issue a warning prior to writing this article. It will be brutally honest, seen as politically incorrect by many people, and it may seem uncaring. Alas, it is not. It is written with a true detective’s desire for a search for the truth and for justice.

I won’t try to explain the “politically correct” issue as it would require an entire book to do so. I know it is brutally honest and it is caring because it comes from my heart and soul and all of my experiences investigating some of the most terrible crimes committed by human beings. I am a retired NYPD Detective who worked for 6 years assigned to the Manhattan Special Victims Squad where I was responsible for investigating sex crimes, rape, serial rape, sexual homicide, felony sexual assault, and child abuse. As is the case with such crimes they also included elements of other crimes such as armed robbery, burglary, kidnapping, etc. I treated each and every one of my victims as if they were family-mother or father, sister or brother, son or daughter.

During my time at the Manhattan Special Victims Squad I found, to my surprise, that at least 20-30 % of the cases that passed through my office were actually false reports. This surprised me because I was led to believe that only 2 % of all rapes were false reports. I later found this much cited statistic was based on a statement and not an actual study.

Against the State: An ... Rockwell Jr., Llewelly... Best Price: $5.02 Buy New $5.52 (as of 11:35 EST - Details) But if 20-30 % of the cases were false reports that meant 70-80 % were very real and very terrifying. I would handle a large caseload which might include a woman raped with a broken bottle, another woman raped and sodomized at gunpoint, and another where a child was apparently burned with an iron. These would sit atop my desk and I would be in charge of prioritizing them. I had a fortunate career and was trained by the best detective I have ever known so I pushed myself to bring the perpetrators of these cases to justice very quickly. Yet it seemed just as I had cleared one case with an arrest another case would replace it. I saw “my victims” as family so I plowed through my investigative work to apprehend the “right” offender and elicit a proper non coerced confession. I was not a natural investigator or interrogator but I was trained well and my clearance rate for any given year would waver between 88%-93%. I wanted that elusive 100% but it was never to be and in the case of a stranger rapist I was dealing with psychopaths who could be elusive-especially if I had many other cases that needed my attention stacked on my desk. Each of these cases represented a victim who I dearly cared about. Whether you were a victim from Harlem or the Upper East Side you, as a victim, would always get my best effort. I would not allow myself any slack.

When I spoke to my victims about those men and women who falsely reported sexual assaults or crimes to the police they were-to a person-horrified. They were horrified that those false reports would take away manpower and resources from their own cases. I agreed.

I have been involved in the arrest of approximately 300 men and women for falsely reporting a crime. In order to effect this type of arrest a Detective would need a full confession and motive that makes sense to the experienced Sex Crimes D.A.s assigned to the case. The Detective would need to clearly and concisely explain to the D.A. exactly where the flaws in logic appeared and where the physical evidence did not match the story. I would often see crime scene staging that I would also present to the D.A. It wasn’t easy. Sometimes I thought it was harder to make a false report arrest than making an arrest of an actual perpetrator. But to me it was vital. To my real victims it was almost as important as making an arrest in their own case. These victims knew I needed to use my time to apprehend the person who attacked them-sometimes brutally. I know this because I asked my victims about this topic with every chance I had. And again, they all agreed that false reports were not only wrong but by taking time away from their investigations it might lead to a perpetrator escaping justice and raping or killing more victims.

My passion led me to author published journal articles on false reports. I have instructed classes on the topic internationally. I also developed a false report red flag index for investigators: The BAFRI (Baeza False Report Index). The BAFRI makes it very clear that just because there is a red flag does not mean the victim is lying, just that the breaks in logic need to be accounted for in order to determine the validity of the account. Red flags are not 100% foolproof and I warn investigators of this fact in my articles.

The Curious Case of Jussie Smollet

Let us take a closer look and examine in detail the allegations made by Jussie Smollett who said he was attacked at 2:00 AM at a Subway sandwich shop in the city of Chicago. I have not examined any of the case material in this matter and I hesitate to rely on media accounts in such cases. I can only rely on media accounts that quote Smollett and include any of his statements or those of the police and alleged witnesses. Keeping that in mind, I have listed a series of questions and red flags that are breaks in logic that need to be explained and logical questions needed to be answered correctly to properly investigate in Smollett’s claim:

Why is there no video footage of the attack? Did he actually purchase anything from the Subway sandwich shop? If so, did he eat his meal there or take it out with him? Did he order a soda or some chips? If he did carry out some items from the Subway shop-were they found? A follow up to #4 is that recent surveillance camera footage showed him holding his sandwich in his hand when entering his building. I find it very unusual someone would hold on to their sandwich after such a shocking attack. If he was on the phone with his manager when allegedly attacked, why not call 911 immediately after the incident? Why walk home after being “assaulted” by two men with ski masks covering their faces. Wasn’t fear an issue? If his manager heard what was happening why didn’t he then call 911 while putting his client on hold? Why keep the rope that the offenders allegedly placed around his neck in place for at least 40 minutes after the initial attack? Video surveillance cameras depict the rope around his neck as he enters his building. During the attack he claims to have been beaten about the face but a photo of him in the hospital after the event shows minor abrasions to the right side of his face. Abrasions are similar to skinned knees and fingernail scrapes-to name just two. I see no injuries resembling those of someone who took a beating about the face. There appear to be no other injuries visible.

He claims the offenders sprayed or poured a bleach-smelling substance on him. If this is so it could be a clue since bleach typically freezes between approximately 5 and 15 degrees Fahrenheit. It was 2 degrees out at the time of the alleged attack.

He wears his wristwatch on his left hand so I could be mistaken but it is likely he is right-handed (as most right handers wear their watch on their left wrist. The point of this is that when injuries are self-inflicted on the face it is often the case that they injure the strong hand side of the face. This is natural if one was to do this.

Why didn’t his alleged attackers take his phone as they must have known it could be used as evidence-especially since he was supposed to be talking to his manager at the time?

Someone else called 911 forty minutes after the attack. Why didn’t he call 911 himself? It still seems unclear at what time the police were notified.

Why and how did he make his way to the hospital? If he was allegedly attacked in such a manner wouldn’t an ambulance be appropriate?

Why delay any apprehension of the alleged perpetrators by delaying handing over his phone to the police? Could he have borrowed a phone in the meantime? This would seem a small inconvenience in this situation.

What are we to make of the threatening letter received by Fox a week before this attack? I’ve seen photos of the letter and there are letters cut out from some sort of magazine or book. This very well may be what often turns out to be a red flag in that that the letter was sent by the alleged victim or someone they knew to support a future claim of an attack. Many letters sent with cut-out letters from newspapers and magazines are often, but not always, indicators of a false report of a threat.

Why did he hand over redacted phone records that do not provide evidence of the time he was allegedly on the phone with his manager?

Battlefield America: T... John W. Whitehead Best Price: $10.95 Buy New $18.80 (as of 10:15 EST - Details) One might logically ask if this were a false report what is the motive? Motive is dynamic and is not always easy to decipher. In this case, if it is indeed a false report the motive is simple: Publicity.

Let us hope the police investigate these questions, learn the true course of events, and, no matter what they find, let truth lead to justice.

I will leave the reader with this 1893 quote from the “father of criminal investigation” Hans Gross:

In order to know exactly the attitude to be maintained towards what has passed, all the circumstances of the crime must be clearly taken into account and submitted to strict logical examination from their commencement to their last stage. If at a given moment something has not been explained, suspicion is justified and pause must be made at the point where the logical sequence is broken, for the purpose of examining if there is no better way of explaining the fact. If one is found the rest of the inquiry is easy.[1]

1. He was assaulted on his way home.

On Jan. 29, Smollett was walking home from a sub shop after getting some sandwiches when he was attacked by two men on the street. Smollett told police that the two men yelled ""'Empire' fa***t"" and ""'Empire' n***er” while hitting him. They also poured an unknown liquid on his and tied a rope in a noose around his neck.

The men also allegedly said “This is MAG country” to the actor as they attacked him.

2. Smollett waited an hour to call the police.

Immediately after the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, where a friend connived to him to call the police. He waiting almost an hour to call them, something he says was due to pride.

“There is a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.”

Police arrived and spoke to him in his home before taking his sweater and the rope as evidence in the investigation. Smollett went to the hospital and was treated and released with minor injuries.

3. It's possible it was a hate crime.

Police have been investigating the assault as a possible hate crime due to the use of racist and homophobic language during the attack. Smollett is himself gay, as is the character he plays on Empire. In later interviews, Smollett also wondered if his outspoken opposition to the current president was a cause for the attack.

He told Good Morning America, “ I come really hard against 45.”

4. There was some doubt about his story.

At some point, rumors began to circulate that the attack had been staged or was an attempt for Smollett to get attention. Some people raised questions because Smollett didn’t turn his phone over to the police right away, and he asked the police not to use their body cameras inside his apartment. The actor addressed that criticism on Good Morning America.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. And I'm sorry but, I'm not going to do that because I have private pictures and videos and phone numbers, my partner's number, my family's numbers, my cast mates' numbers, my private emails, private songs, voice memos, pictures, videos…” As for reports of a fake attack, Chicago police's chief communications officer said, ""We have no evidence to support their reporting.""

5. There was no sign of the attack on surveillance footage.

Without witnesses, Smollett worried that there would be no chance of even finding out who attacked him, However, he had taken note of the presence of a surveillance camera in the area. When police got the footage from it, there was no sign of the attack, however, because the camera had been pointing away from the location.

The footage did reveal two men walking on the same street where the attack took place. Smollett told Good Morning America that he believed those two men to be his assailants and was hopeful that police would find them.

6. Two men have been arrested.

As of Feb. 15, two men have been taken in for questioning in the attack. At this time, police have not released their names.

Police confirmed that the two men are brothers and are from Nigeria. They were approached by police at O’Hare airport after flying in from Nigeria on the evening of Feb. 13. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed that one of the persons of interest had appeared on Smollett’s series Empire but would not give more information about that connection.

7. Smollet says he'll never be the same.

Smollett says he’ll never be the same after these events. He hopes that there is still some footage of the attack.

“I want that video found so badly because, for probably four reasons. Number one, I want them to find the people that did it. Number two, I want them to stop being able to say 'alleged' attack. Number three, I want them to see that I fought back. I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f*** back. They ran off. I didn’t.”

This situation is developing and police have not released any new information about the persons of interest.

AURORA, Ill. (AP) — A 15-year employee being fired from a suburban Chicago manufacturing company started shooting Friday, killing five co-workers and wounding five police officers before he was killed by police, authorities said.

Aurora, Illinois, Police Chief Kristen Ziman said 45-year-old Gary Martin “was being terminated” before he started shooting at the Henry Pratt Co. — which makes valves for industrial purposes — in the city about 40 miles (65 kilometres) west of Chicago.

She told a news conference that in addition to the five employees killed, a sixth worker was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life threatening. A sixth police officer suffered a knee injury while officers were searching the building.

Ziman said officers arrived within four minutes of receiving reports of the shooting and were fired upon as soon as they entered the 29,000-square-foot manufacturing warehouse.

Police said they did not know the gunman’s motive.

Trump declaration faces uncertain fate in coming court fight

WASHINGTON (AP) — Let the lawsuits begin.

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency along the southern border Friday and predicted his administration would end up defending it all the way to the Supreme Court.

That might have been the only thing Trump said Friday that produced near-universal agreement.

The American Civil Liberties Union announced its intention to sue less than an hour after the White House released the text of Trump’s declaration that the “current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency.”

Non-profit watchdog group Public Citizen filed suit later, urging the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to “bar Trump and the U.S. Department of Defence from using the declaration and funds appropriated for other purposes to build a border wall.”

Nigeria delays election until Feb. 23 over ‘challenges’

KANO, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria’s electoral commission delayed the presidential election until Feb. 23, making the announcement a mere five hours before polls were set to open Saturday. It cited unspecified “challenges” amid reports that voting materials had not been delivered to all parts of the country.

Residents of Africa’s most populous nation and largest democracy will soon wake up to outrage. Many had relocated for the chance to vote.

“This was a difficult decision to take but necessary for successful delivery of the elections and the consolidation of our democracy,” commission chairman Mahmood Yakubu told reporters in the capital, Abuja. He said more details would be released during an afternoon briefing.

A review of logistics, along with the determination to hold a credible vote, led the commission to conclude that going ahead with the election as planned was “no longer feasible,” he said.

Nigeria also postponed the previous presidential election in 2015 because of deadly insecurity in the northeast, which remains under threat from Islamic extremists.

Chicago police release 2 men questioned in Smollett case

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

“The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

Court filing: Manafort faces more than 19 years in prison

WASHINGTON (AP) — Paul Manafort, the one-time chairman of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, could spend more than 19 years in prison on tax and bank fraud charges, prosecutors said Friday.

Court documents filed by special counsel Robert Mueller’s office reveal that Manafort faces possibly the lengthiest prison term in the Russia investigation. The 69-year-old Manafort is also at serious risk of spending the rest of his life in prison if a federal judge imposes a sentence within federal guidelines.

The potential sentence stems from Manafort’s conviction last year on eight felony counts related to an elaborate scheme to conceal from tax authorities the millions of dollars he earned overseas from Ukrainian political consulting. It is one of two criminal cases pending against Manafort in which he faces prison time.

Manafort, who led Trump’s campaign for months during the 2016 presidential campaign, is not charged with any crimes directly related to Russian election interference, the thrust of Mueller’s probe. But prosecutors have recently revealed that they remain deeply interested in his contacts during and after the campaign with an associate the FBI says has ties to Russian intelligence.

In a 27-page court filing Friday, prosecutors did not recommend a precise sentence for Manafort, but they agreed with a calculation by federal probation officials that his crimes deserve a punishment of between 19.5 and 24.5 years. They also lay out in great detail for U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III how they say Manafort’s greed drove him to disregard American law.

APNewsBreak: Allred contacted authorities about R Kelly tape

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorney Gloria Allred told The Associated Press Friday she has contacted law enforcement about concerns one of her clients may be the person in a VHS tape recently given to Chicago prosecutors that purportedly shows R&B star R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl.

Allred, who represents multiple R. Kelly accusers, some of whom haven’t come forward publicly, spoke a day after attorney Michael Avenatti said he gave Chicago prosecutors the video.

“I’ve made law enforcement in a different jurisdiction (other than Chicago) aware of my concerns that it may, in fact, be my client and I want to protect her privacy,” Allred told the AP in a telephone interview.

Kelly has been dogged for decades with allegations of sexual misconduct. Through his lawyers, he has consistently denied them. His current attorney, Steve Greenberg, told the AP Allred’s comments were “speculative.”

Greenberg also said he wasn’t aware of any moves afoot to charge Kelly with anything.

Kaepernick, Eric Reid settle collusion grievances with NFL

NEW YORK (AP) — With a public hearing looming and the threat of owners and league officials facing depositions, the NFL settled collusion cases brought by Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid.

The league, about to celebrate its 100th season, faced criticism from all sides thanks to the protest movement started by Kaepernick. Many Kaepernick supporters wanted to see him back on the field, while other fans said they wouldn’t watch if the league allowed players to protest during the national anthem.

The league and Kaepernick’s lawyer sent out statements Friday saying that “the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances” and that a confidentiality agreement would prevent either side from commenting further.

It remains unclear if the NFL admitted wrongdoing or how much money Reid, Kaepernick or others may have received. Considering the lost salary both players claimed and legal costs, the settlement could have climbed into the tens of millions of dollars.

“For the past several months, counsel for Mr. Kaepernick and Mr. Reid have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL,” the league statement said. “As a result of those discussions, the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances. The resolution of this matter is subject to a confidentiality agreement so there will be no further comment by any party.”

Payless ShoeSource to shutter all of its remaining US stores

NEW YORK (AP) — Payless ShoeSource is shuttering all of its 2,100 remaining stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, joining a list of iconic names like Toys R Us and Bon-Ton that have closed down in the last year.

The Topeka, Kansas-based chain said Friday it will hold liquidation sales starting Sunday and wind down its e-commerce operations. All of the stores will remain open until at least the end of March and the majority will remain open until May.

The debt-burdened chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2017, closing hundreds of stores as part of its reorganization.

At the time, it had over 4,400 stores in more than 30 countries. It remerged from restructuring four months later with about 3,500 stores and eliminated more than $435 million in debt.

The company said in an email that the liquidation doesn’t affect its franchise operations or its Latin American stores, which remain open for business as usual. It lists 18,000 employees worldwide.

Academy reverses plans, will air all awards live at Oscars

NEW YORK (AP) — Bowing to a backlash that had threatened to engulf an already blunder-plagued Academy Awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Friday reversed its decision to present four awards during the commercial breaks of this year’s Oscar broadcast.

All 24 categories will be shown live, after all, at the 91st Academy Awards on February 24, the academy announced in a statement. On Monday, the academy had said that the winning speeches for cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short would be aired in a shortened, taped segment during the broadcast.

“Nine days until the showtime, still tweaking the script” the Academy tweeted Friday.

The academy did not address whether the change meant extending the show’s length, which organizers have said would be reduced to three hours.

The academy’s move to strike awards from the live broadcast was fiercely contested by many of this year’s Oscar nominees, including “Roma” director Alfonso Cuaron and “BlacKkKlansman” filmmaker Spike Lee. The American Society of Cinematographers on Wednesday issued an open-letter to the academy, signed by Martin Scorsese, Brad Pitt and others, calling the plans an insult to the cinematic arts.

Snow too thick to plow keeps skiers from California resorts

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Winter weather enveloping California’s mountains for a fourth straight day Friday kept skiers from hitting the slopes at the start of the Presidents Day holiday weekend, with snow so deep that plows could not tackle it and cities scrambled to find places to pile it.

Several routes to the ski mecca of Lake Tahoe shut down, including about 70 miles (110 kilometres) of Interstate 80 from Colfax, California, to the Nevada state line.

I-80 was reopened to passenger vehicles Friday evening.

Chains were required for travel in many other parts of the towering Sierra Nevada.

“All avid skiers are itching to get out on the mountain, but the roads are pretty treacherous right now,” said Kevin Cooper, marketing director for Lake Tahoe TV.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

“The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on Empire,” Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man’s job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police earlier this week said there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation.

Police: Aurora attacker used gun he shouldn’t have owned

AURORA, Ill. (AP) — The man who opened fire and killed five co-workers including the plant manager, human resources manager and an intern working his first day at a suburban Chicago manufacturing warehouse, took a gun he wasn’t supposed to have to a job he was about to lose.

Right after learning Friday that he was being fired from his job of 15 years at the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, Gary Martin pulled out a gun and began shooting, killing the three people in the room with him and two others just outside and wounding a sixth employee, police said Saturday.

Martin shot and wounded five of the first officers to get to the scene, including one who didn’t even make it inside the sprawling warehouse in Aurora, Illinois, a city of 200,000 about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Chicago.

After that flurry of shots and with officers from throughout the region streaming in to help, he ran off and hid in the back of the building, where officers found him about an hour later and killed him during an exchange of gunfire, police said.

“He was probably waiting for us to get to him there,” Aurora police Lt. Rick Robertson said. “It was just a very short gunfight and it was over, so he was basically in the back waiting for us and fired upon us and our officers fired.”

Aurora shooting victims ranged from intern to plant manager

CHICAGO (AP) — The victims of a disgruntled employee who opened fire at a suburban Chicago industrial warehouse were co-workers ranging from an intern to the plant manager. A look at the victims:

TREVOR WEHNER

The 21-year-old Northern Illinois University student was on his first day as an intern in human resources at Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora and attended the fateful meeting where the gunman was fired and then started shooting.

Jay Wehner said his nephew grew up about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Aurora in Sheridan and was expected to graduate from Northern Illinois University in May with a degree in human resource management. He was on the dean’s list at NIU’s business college.

“He always, always was happy,” Jay Wehner said. “I have no bad words for him. He was a wonderful person. You can’t say anything but nice things about him.”

Chicago police: Jussie Smollett assault case has ‘shifted’

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the attack reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers arrested in the case then released, and police want to interview the “Empire” actor again.

Chicago police had released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the reported attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

State Department: Nauert out as pick for UN ambassador

WASHINGTON (AP) — Heather Nauert, picked by President Donald Trump to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations but never officially nominated, has withdrawn from consideration, the State Department said.

Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a department statement that “the past two months have been grueling for my family and therefore it is in the best interest of my family that I withdraw my name from consideration.”

Nauert’s impending nomination had been considered a tough sell in the Senate, where she would have faced tough questions about her relative lack of foreign policy experience, according to congressional aides.

A potential issue involving a nanny that she and her husband had employed may also have been a factor in her decision to withdraw, according to one aide. That issue, which was first reported by Bloomberg on Saturday, centered on a foreign nanny who was legally in the U.S. but did not have legal status to work, according to the aide, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The aide said some involved in the vetting process saw Nauert’s inexperience and questions about her ability to represent the U.S. at the U.N. as a larger issue.

Potential privacy lapse found in Americans’ 2010 census data

WASHINGTON (AP) — An internal team at the Census Bureau found that basic personal information collected from more than 100 million Americans during the 2010 head count could be reconstructed from obscured data, but with lots of mistakes, a top agency official disclosed Saturday.

The age, gender, location, race and ethnicity for 138 million people were potentially vulnerable. So far, however, only internal hacking teams have discovered such details at possible risk, and no outside groups are known to have grabbed data intended to remain private for 72 years, chief scientist John Abowd told a scientific conference.

The Census Bureau is now scrapping its old data shielding technique for a state-of-the-art method that Abowd claimed is far better than Google’s or Apple’s.

Some former agency chiefs fear the potential privacy problem will add to the worries that people will avoid answering or lie on the once-every-10-year survey because of the Trump administration’s attempt to add a much-debated citizenship question.

The Supreme Court on Friday announced that it would rule on that proposed question, which has been criticized for being political and not properly tested in the field. The census count is hugely important, helping with the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and distribution of billions of dollars in federal money.

Vatican defrocks former US cardinal McCarrick for sex abuse

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has been found guilty by the Vatican of sex abuse and defrocked, as calls rose Saturday for Pope Francis to reveal what he knew about the once-powerful American prelate’s apparently decades-long predatory sexual behavior.

The announcement Saturday, delivered in uncharacteristically blunt language for the Vatican, meant that the 88-year-old McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., becomes the highest-ranking churchman and the first cardinal to be punished by dismissal from the clerical state, or laicization.

He was notified Friday of the decision, which was upheld upon his appeal and approved by Pope Francis.

The pontiff next week leads a summit of bishops from around the world who have been summoned to Rome help him grapple with the entrenched problems of clerical sex abuse and the systematic cover-ups by the Catholic church’s hierarchy.

Decades of revelations about priests who have sexually preyed on minors and their bosses who shuffled abusive clergy from parish to parish instead of removing them from access to children have shaken the faith of many Catholics. They also threaten the moral authority of Francis and even the survival of his papacy.

Storm-lashed South Carolina reassesses global warming’s role

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — When he took the job 15 years ago, Horry County Emergency Manager Randy Webster figured his biggest disasters would be wind and surge rolling over his county’s beaches, South Carolina’s top tourist destination.

Instead, his worries have shifted inland, where rivers overflowing their banks have caused two massive floods in three years.

“We’re getting into this sort of unknown territory,” Webster said. “We typically in emergency management have some point of reference to work with. Two floods like this — it’s unheard of.”

Scientists say the Earth’s warming climate means more heavy rainfall over short periods of time, and that translates to larger, more ferocious storms on the scale of 2017’s Hurricane Harvey in Texas or 2018’s Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas. Florence dumped six months’ worth of rain on the Carolinas in the course of just a few days.

The growing realization that such events are going to become more common as the result of global warming is forcing Webster and other state officials to revisit how they prepare for and respond to natural disasters.

Dem presidential candidates introducing themselves to voters

Five Democratic senators vying for their party’s nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 fanned out across the country Saturday to campaign and meet voters.

Kamala Harris of California spent her second straight day in the pivotal early-voting state of South Carolina, holding a town hall meeting in Columbia, the capital. Also visiting the state was Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who met with an estimated 800 voters in Greenville before heading to Georgia — an unusual early stop for a White House hopeful but one that signals Democratic hopes to make inroads in the South.

Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York both focused on New Hampshire. Booker made his first visit to there since joining the race earlier this month, holding a question-and-answer session with more than 400 voters in Portsmouth.

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, meanwhile, made her own uncommon choice for early campaigning by visiting Wisconsin before heading to Iowa, home to the nation’s first caucus.

And a Democratic heavyweight who’s yet to address his 2020 plans, former Vice President Joe Biden, made his own high-profile appearance at the Munich Security Conference.

Gone in a New York minute: How the Amazon deal fell apart

NEW YORK (AP) — In early November, word began to leak that Amazon was serious about choosing New York to build a giant new campus. The city was eager to lure the company and its thousands of high-paying tech jobs, offering billions in tax incentives and lighting the Empire State Building in Amazon orange.

Even Governor Andrew Cuomo got in on the action: “I’ll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that’s what it takes,” he joked at the time.

Then Amazon made it official: It chose the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens to build a $2.5 billion campus that could house 25,000 workers, in addition to new offices planned for northern Virginia. Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Democrats who have been political adversaries for years, trumpeted the decision as a major coup after edging out more than 230 other proposals.

But what they didn’t expect was the protests, the hostile public hearings and the disparaging tweets that would come in the next three months, eventually leading to Amazon’s dramatic Valentine’s Day breakup with New York.

Immediately after Amazon’s Nov. 12 announcement, criticism started to pour in. The deal included $1.5 billion in special tax breaks and grants for the company, but a closer look at the total package revealed it to be worth at least $2.8 billion. Some of the same politicians who had signed a letter to woo Amazon were now balking at the tax incentives.

John Collins: Favorite dunker is Hawks teammate Vince Carter

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — John Collins has a favorite dunker. Not surprisingly, it’s his Atlanta teammate Vince Carter.

Collins will represent the Hawks in the dunk contest, one of the events during All-Star Saturday Night. The 3-point contest and skills competition are also on the evening docket.

Collins had perhaps the best dunk of the Rising Stars game Friday night, going with a pass off the backboard to himself for a slam over Dallas’ Luka Doncic. He says he’s got three or four dunks ready to go for Saturday night.

He won’t reveal what to expect: “No hints,” he said Saturday morning.

AURORA, Ill. (AP) — A 15-year employee being fired from a suburban Chicago manufacturing company started shooting Friday, killing five co-workers and wounding five police officers before he was killed by police, authorities said.

Aurora, Illinois, Police Chief Kristen Ziman said 45-year-old Gary Martin “was being terminated” before he started shooting at the Henry Pratt Co. — which makes valves for industrial purposes — in the city about 40 miles (65 kilometres) west of Chicago.

She told a news conference that in addition to the five employees killed, a sixth worker was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life threatening. A sixth police officer suffered a knee injury while officers were searching the building.

Ziman said officers arrived within four minutes of receiving reports of the shooting and were fired upon as soon as they entered the 29,000-square-foot manufacturing warehouse.

Police said they did not know the gunman’s motive.

Trump declaration faces uncertain fate in coming court fight

WASHINGTON (AP) — Let the lawsuits begin.

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency along the southern border Friday and predicted his administration would end up defending it all the way to the Supreme Court.

That might have been the only thing Trump said Friday that produced near-universal agreement.

The American Civil Liberties Union announced its intention to sue less than an hour after the White House released the text of Trump’s declaration that the “current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency.”

Non-profit watchdog group Public Citizen filed suit later, urging the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to “bar Trump and the U.S. Department of Defence from using the declaration and funds appropriated for other purposes to build a border wall.”

Nigeria delays election until Feb. 23 over ‘challenges’

KANO, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria’s electoral commission delayed the presidential election until Feb. 23, making the announcement a mere five hours before polls were set to open Saturday. It cited unspecified “challenges” amid reports that voting materials had not been delivered to all parts of the country.

Residents of Africa’s most populous nation and largest democracy will soon wake up to outrage. Many had relocated for the chance to vote.

“This was a difficult decision to take but necessary for successful delivery of the elections and the consolidation of our democracy,” commission chairman Mahmood Yakubu told reporters in the capital, Abuja. He said more details would be released during an afternoon briefing.

A review of logistics, along with the determination to hold a credible vote, led the commission to conclude that going ahead with the election as planned was “no longer feasible,” he said.

Nigeria also postponed the previous presidential election in 2015 because of deadly insecurity in the northeast, which remains under threat from Islamic extremists.

Chicago police release 2 men questioned in Smollett case

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

“The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

Court filing: Manafort faces more than 19 years in prison

WASHINGTON (AP) — Paul Manafort, the one-time chairman of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, could spend more than 19 years in prison on tax and bank fraud charges, prosecutors said Friday.

Court documents filed by special counsel Robert Mueller’s office reveal that Manafort faces possibly the lengthiest prison term in the Russia investigation. The 69-year-old Manafort is also at serious risk of spending the rest of his life in prison if a federal judge imposes a sentence within federal guidelines.

The potential sentence stems from Manafort’s conviction last year on eight felony counts related to an elaborate scheme to conceal from tax authorities the millions of dollars he earned overseas from Ukrainian political consulting. It is one of two criminal cases pending against Manafort in which he faces prison time.

Manafort, who led Trump’s campaign for months during the 2016 presidential campaign, is not charged with any crimes directly related to Russian election interference, the thrust of Mueller’s probe. But prosecutors have recently revealed that they remain deeply interested in his contacts during and after the campaign with an associate the FBI says has ties to Russian intelligence.

In a 27-page court filing Friday, prosecutors did not recommend a precise sentence for Manafort, but they agreed with a calculation by federal probation officials that his crimes deserve a punishment of between 19.5 and 24.5 years. They also lay out in great detail for U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III how they say Manafort’s greed drove him to disregard American law.

APNewsBreak: Allred contacted authorities about R Kelly tape

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorney Gloria Allred told The Associated Press Friday she has contacted law enforcement about concerns one of her clients may be the person in a VHS tape recently given to Chicago prosecutors that purportedly shows R&B star R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl.

Allred, who represents multiple R. Kelly accusers, some of whom haven’t come forward publicly, spoke a day after attorney Michael Avenatti said he gave Chicago prosecutors the video.

“I’ve made law enforcement in a different jurisdiction (other than Chicago) aware of my concerns that it may, in fact, be my client and I want to protect her privacy,” Allred told the AP in a telephone interview.

Kelly has been dogged for decades with allegations of sexual misconduct. Through his lawyers, he has consistently denied them. His current attorney, Steve Greenberg, told the AP Allred’s comments were “speculative.”

Greenberg also said he wasn’t aware of any moves afoot to charge Kelly with anything.

Kaepernick, Eric Reid settle collusion grievances with NFL

NEW YORK (AP) — With a public hearing looming and the threat of owners and league officials facing depositions, the NFL settled collusion cases brought by Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid.

The league, about to celebrate its 100th season, faced criticism from all sides thanks to the protest movement started by Kaepernick. Many Kaepernick supporters wanted to see him back on the field, while other fans said they wouldn’t watch if the league allowed players to protest during the national anthem.

The league and Kaepernick’s lawyer sent out statements Friday saying that “the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances” and that a confidentiality agreement would prevent either side from commenting further.

It remains unclear if the NFL admitted wrongdoing or how much money Reid, Kaepernick or others may have received. Considering the lost salary both players claimed and legal costs, the settlement could have climbed into the tens of millions of dollars.

“For the past several months, counsel for Mr. Kaepernick and Mr. Reid have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL,” the league statement said. “As a result of those discussions, the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances. The resolution of this matter is subject to a confidentiality agreement so there will be no further comment by any party.”

Payless ShoeSource to shutter all of its remaining US stores

NEW YORK (AP) — Payless ShoeSource is shuttering all of its 2,100 remaining stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, joining a list of iconic names like Toys R Us and Bon-Ton that have closed down in the last year.

The Topeka, Kansas-based chain said Friday it will hold liquidation sales starting Sunday and wind down its e-commerce operations. All of the stores will remain open until at least the end of March and the majority will remain open until May.

The debt-burdened chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2017, closing hundreds of stores as part of its reorganization.

At the time, it had over 4,400 stores in more than 30 countries. It remerged from restructuring four months later with about 3,500 stores and eliminated more than $435 million in debt.

The company said in an email that the liquidation doesn’t affect its franchise operations or its Latin American stores, which remain open for business as usual. It lists 18,000 employees worldwide.

Academy reverses plans, will air all awards live at Oscars

NEW YORK (AP) — Bowing to a backlash that had threatened to engulf an already blunder-plagued Academy Awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Friday reversed its decision to present four awards during the commercial breaks of this year’s Oscar broadcast.

All 24 categories will be shown live, after all, at the 91st Academy Awards on February 24, the academy announced in a statement. On Monday, the academy had said that the winning speeches for cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short would be aired in a shortened, taped segment during the broadcast.

“Nine days until the showtime, still tweaking the script” the Academy tweeted Friday.

The academy did not address whether the change meant extending the show’s length, which organizers have said would be reduced to three hours.

The academy’s move to strike awards from the live broadcast was fiercely contested by many of this year’s Oscar nominees, including “Roma” director Alfonso Cuaron and “BlacKkKlansman” filmmaker Spike Lee. The American Society of Cinematographers on Wednesday issued an open-letter to the academy, signed by Martin Scorsese, Brad Pitt and others, calling the plans an insult to the cinematic arts.

Snow too thick to plow keeps skiers from California resorts

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Winter weather enveloping California’s mountains for a fourth straight day Friday kept skiers from hitting the slopes at the start of the Presidents Day holiday weekend, with snow so deep that plows could not tackle it and cities scrambled to find places to pile it.

Several routes to the ski mecca of Lake Tahoe shut down, including about 70 miles (110 kilometres) of Interstate 80 from Colfax, California, to the Nevada state line.

I-80 was reopened to passenger vehicles Friday evening.

Chains were required for travel in many other parts of the towering Sierra Nevada.

“All avid skiers are itching to get out on the mountain, but the roads are pretty treacherous right now,” said Kevin Cooper, marketing director for Lake Tahoe TV.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O’Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett’s account.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on “Empire” and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of “Empire” released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was “patently ridiculous,” and that they continue to stand behind him."

Monico, appearing on WGN’s The Roe Conn Show, discussed Cohen and special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation for several minutes, before confirming the actor is a client of his.

“I’d like to get your thoughts [on] Jussie Smollett here, but we can’t get your thoughts on Jussie Smollett because [of] this big developing story today, and it turns out you’re the attorney for Jussie Smollett, too,” Conn said to Monico.

“Yes, at the moment, I am,” Monico replied.

“Oh for god sakes!” Conn joked. “Can you stop getting clients so I can talk to you about the stories?”

It is unclear when Monico began representing Smollett, and in what capacity he is doing so.

Monico, a former federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Illinois, and his law partner, Barry Spevack, took over as Cohen’s attorney, the longtime Trump lawyer’s press representative Lanny Davis said January 28. Monico and Spevack took over for Guy Petrillo, a criminal defense attorney who previously served as the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office’s criminal division chief.

The development comes as an investigation into Smollett’s account of being beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack took a sharp turn Friday when police announced the arrest of two black men they believe assaulted him.

At least one of the men worked on the TV show, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said authorities had probable cause to believe the suspects committed assault and battery against Smollett. However, they had not been charged as of Friday afternoon.

Guglielmi would not comment on a possible motive.

Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. Further, he claimed they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

The police spokesman said that there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

The two suspects, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on Empire, according to police.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. He said police also are contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation.

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent? And at different moments...you're seeing the yin and yang of that, the positive and negative of both. Both are just trying to love this child."

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on Empire, Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police earlier this week said there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation."

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O'Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognised from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,"" Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett's account.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on ""Empire"" and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of ""Empire"" released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was ""patently ridiculous,"" and that they continue to stand behind him."

“What are you going to say when the attackers turn out to be black?” he asked, taunting me.

Smollett, an openly gay black man and starring cast member of the popular TV show, has maintained that two masked men beat him, doused him with a substance believed to be bleach and put a rope around his neck, after first hurling racial and homophobic slurs.

The horrendous incident allegedly happened Jan. 29th around 2 a.m. in the 300 block of East North Water Street in the Streeterville neighborhood.

The peeved reader was referring to a video clip of two figures dressed in dark clothing who were walking near the area where Smollett said he was attacked.

The notion that Smollett was the victim of a hate crime in Streeterville was too far-fetched for a lot of people, and when an exhaustive search of video from cameras in the area turned up nothing – well, the rumors flew.

It didn’t take long for doubters to pick apart Smollett’s account of the attack, prompting him to go on “Good Morning America” Thursday to defend himself.

“I want the video found, found badly,” he told Robin Roberts, GMA’s anchor.

“I want a little gay boy, who might watch this to see that I fought f— back,” he said.

The attackers had allegedly yelled this is “MAGA country” as they tussled with Smollett then ran off. “MAGA” is an acronym for the Trump slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

Frankly, the incident was so bizarre, it sounded like a scene from a bad movie.

The bombshell, of course, is that two men were arrested in connection with the Smollett attack — and they turned out to be two African-American brothers.

Authorities, though, released them late Friday night after questioning them for two days, saying in a tweet, “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

A law enforcement source told the Sun-Times on Saturday that detectives were pursuing information that Smollett may have paid the brothers to orchestrate the attack.

But police were careful not to imply publicly that the attack was a “hoax” or “staged” even as the Internet was running wild with speculation.

Earlier Friday, Chicago police added to the drama when they announced the arrest of the two brothers, who had been detained since Wednesday when they arrived at O’Hare Airport from a flight from Nigeria.

Their home had been searched, with police reportedly taking away a “black face-mask hat, an Empire script, phone, receipts, a red hat and bleach,” CBS2 reported.

According to police sources, one of the brothers plays a body double for Smollett’s gay lover on the show and is also his personal trainer in real life.

Coincidentally, Nigeria is considered the most homophobic country on earth.

In 2014, then-Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan signed into law the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act, which criminalizes gay marriage and carries penalties of up to 14 years for organizations and individuals that support the LGBT community, and bans open displays of homosexuality.

Human Rights Watch found that since the law passed, there have been “rising incidents of mob violence, with groups of people gathering together and acting with a common intent of committing acts of violence against persons based on their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.”

If the incident happened the way Smollett described, the attackers should be charged with a hate crime. Under Illinois statutes, a hate crime is a Class 4 felony for a first offense.

And if it didn’t, Smollett and whoever else may have been involved should be held accountable for squandering the city’s resources.

Because the worst part of this alleged hate crime is the vast police resources that have been devoted to finding Smollett’s attackers.

After all, Chicago police solved fewer than one in six homicides in the first half of 2018, according to an analysis by USA Today.

Fair or unfair, relatives of homicide victims likely see the intense investigation into the Smollett beating as proof that they don’t matter.

Andre Smith, 20th Ward aldermanic candidate, pointed that out last week when a 1-year-old boy was shot in the head on the South Side.

“We need to know how many man-hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars of the taxpayer’s money have been spent on arresting the two alleged perpetrators. Yet no one has been arrested in the baby boy shooting,” Smith said in a press release.

Meanwhile, what am I going to say if Smollett’s alleged attackers turn out to be black?

“What idiots. The real Trump supporters are going to have a heyday.”"

Shortly before this announcement was made, Michael Monico appeared on Roe Conn’s radio program on WGN to announce that Smollett had hired the high-powered defense attorney to represent him. Monico is the same attorney who is representing President Trump’s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen.

In the days leading up to this development, almost every local news outlet in Chicago reported that inside sources claimed the police were investigating the incident as a hoax and had found evidence that Smollett may have set it up. Police quickly denied it, but none of the outlets have retracted their stories or deleted their tweets.

This recent development further confirms that something is seriously wrong with Smollett’s account of the alleged attack.

TMZ finally admitted that they printed fake news when they reported that the men who “attacked” Smollett were white.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Friday, reports CBS 2 News Chicago.

Guglielmi said the men are no longer suspects and the investigation is ongoing, reports ABC 7 Eyewitness News.

Smollett, 36, told police he was attacked by two men around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 on his way to his apartment. He said the men yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured a chemical on him and put a rope around his neck. Two men were seen on a surveillance video near the location of the alleged attack.

Police raided the Osundairo brothers homes on Wednesday and met them at O'Hare International Airport as they arrived after a trip to Nigeria. Police reportedly seized a black face mask hat, an Empire script, a phone, receipts, bleach and a red hat. At least one of the brothers worked on Empire.

Two sources close to the investigation told CBS 2 News the attack was ""potentially orchestrated by the actor himself,"" and two other men were involved.

Police said that while there is no evidence of the alleged attack yet, there is also no evidence of it being a hoax. They are still treating Smollett as a victim and he continues to cooperate in the investigation.

20th Century Fox Television also denied a reports that Smollett and the men planned the attack because Smollett was going to be written off Empire.

""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" the studio said.

On Thursday, Smollett gave his first interview since the alleged attack, telling Good Morning America's Robin Roberts he wants the surveillance footage from that night released.

“I want them to see that I fought back and I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the [expletive] back. And it does not take anything away from people that are not able to do that but I fought back,"" Smollett, an openly gay actor, said. ""They ran off. I didn't.""

Smollett said he initially did not want to call police, but his friend and creative director Frank Gatson, contacted them on his behalf.

“There's a level of pride there,” Smollett explained. “We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak, and I'm not weak. I'm not weak, and we as a people are not weak.”

Smollett has played Jamal Lyon on Empire since 2015 and starred in 2017's Alien: Covenant.

CHICAGO (Sun-Times Media Wire) - Two men questioned in the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett have been released without being charged.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging…,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

The individuals are no longer considered suspects, Guglielmi said. He said detectives would continue working on the case.

Police say two people captured surveillance photos were walking on New Street near Illinois Street between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. Jan. 29, about one block away from where Smollett told officers he was at 2 a.m.

“While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously and wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,” Guglielmi said on Twitter at the time.

Smollett was attacked around 2 a.m. Tuesday as he was walking back to an apartment after a late-night meal at a Subway restaurant at 511 N. McClurg Court, police said.

Two men indicated they recognized Smollett and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street, before they hit him in the face, poured what is suspected to be bleach on him and put a rope around his neck, Smollett told police.

Smollett walked into Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he was treated for lacerations to his face and neck and later released.

After describing the attackers as men wearing ski-masks and all black clothing in an initial report filed with police, Smollett told detectives in a follow-up interview that the men yelled “this is MAGA country” after they assaulted him.

Police did not initially name the victim, but a statement from 20th Century Fox identified him as Jussie Smollett.

“We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,” studio officials wrote in the statement. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Congressman Bobby Rush on Wednesday wrote a letter to the FBI asking the bureau to open a hate crime investigation into the attack.

“As you are aware, crimes of this nature strike fear at the very core of a community and have a long-lasting impact on its members,” Rush wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray. “They are, therefore, rightfully characterized as hate crimes.”

The FBI is already investigating a letter sent on Jan. 22 to Fox and “Empire” offices that used “threatening language” toward Smollett, police said. The letter was laced with some type of white, powdery substance, according to a police spokesman.

Activist Andrew Holmes offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in Smollett’s attack. Holmes said confidential tips can be called in at (800) 883-5587.

More than a dozen police detectives, some specializing in hate crimes, are working the case. They asked anyone who has information or witnessed the attack to call detectives at (312) 747-8382 or submit an anonymous tip at cpdtip.com."

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

But police earlier this week said there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation."

According to the media house, this was confirmed by the Chicago police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi, who said Friday that the brothers who were arrested Wednesday, were released “due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations,” and that “detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

Recall that the brothers were being viewed as “potential suspects” and that detectives had “probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.”

Police did not say at that time precisely what the brothers were accused of or what the alleged crime might have been. Plus, the two men and Smollett had some kind of previous affiliation, a police source told CNN, without providing further detail.

But now they are free, without any charge, and we can’t wait for the police to conclude their investigations.

“Detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Guglielmi added.

A spokeswoman previously told PEOPLE the pair was arrested Wednesday evening. Because they were not charged, police withheld identifying information about them.

The police spokeswoman also confirmed the suspects are the same people as those previously identified as persons of interest.

An attorney for the men, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS Chicago on Thursday that the men know Smollett from working on Empire and go to the same gym on occasion.

Schmidt did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

Officials also recently denied reports that the attack on Smollett was staged.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Guglielmi told PEOPLE in a statement. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

The Chicago Police Department previously confirmed in a statement that a member of the hit Fox show was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery.”

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Thursday, responding to the claims. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” the statement said, adding, “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett was also brought in for questioning on Thursday.

During his first in-depth, televised interview with Good Morning America, Smollett broke down in tears when asked if he would be able to heal if his attackers are never found.

“I don’t know. Let’s just hope that they are, you know what I’m saying? Let’s not go there yet,” he said, crying.

“I was talking to a friend and I said, ‘I just want them to find them.’ And she said, ‘Sweetie, they’re not going to find them,’ ” he said. “That just made me so angry. So I’m just going to be left here like this? I’m just going to be left here? They get to go free, go about their life, and possibly attack someone else. And I’m here left with the aftermath? That’s not cool to me. That’s not okay.”

“I understand how difficult it will be to find them but we’ve got to,” he insisted. “I still want to believe, with everything that happened, that there’s something called justice.”"

CHICAGO - Two “potential suspects” were under arrest and being interrogated in the probe of a black, openly gay US television actor’s report that he was assaulted in a hate crime, police said on Friday.

Actor Jussie Smollett, of the television program Empire, reported the late-night incident to police on 29 January.

The 36-year-old said two men beat him while he was walking on the streets of downtown Chicago at around 2.00am, and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. He said the two had also poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck.

Chicago police said on Friday they had arrested two “potential suspects” who were being interrogated for a second day, accompanied by their attorney.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime,” police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said.



The developments came after a flurry of US media reports that detectives were looking into the possibility that the attack was staged.

But Guglielmi told AFP in an emailed statement: “There is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

Multiple US media outlets reported that the two men are brothers who were arrested at Chicago’s O’Hare airport upon return from a trip to Nigeria. At least one of the men reportedly worked on Empire, a series about the fortunes of an ailing hip-hop mogul and his family battling over control of a multi-million-dollar music company.



Police in late January released surveillance images of two men they considered persons of interest in the case. But they have found no video of the attack itself.

SMOLLETT DETAILS ATTACK

In an emotional interview with ABC’s Good Morning America broadcast on Thursday, Smollett gave the most detailed account yet of what had happened and said he was angry at doubts of his veracity.



Smollett said a masked man yelled Empire as the 36-year-old actor was walking through an intersection after a late-night stop at a sandwich shop. He was on the phone with his manager at the time.



“It’s Chicago in winter. People can wear ski masks and nobody’s going to question that,” Smollett said.



After he ignored the man, Smollett said the attacker yelled out a racial slur and used Donald Trump’s campaign slogan acronym “MAGA,” which stands for “Make America Great Again.”

Smollett said the man called Chicago “MAGA country” and then punched him in the face, at which point the actor fought with the attacker, and was kicked by a second man he had not noticed earlier.



“It felt like minutes, but it was probably like 30 seconds, honestly,” Smollett said.

He was not seriously injured aside from bruises and said he had initially hesitated to report the incident out of concern for his privacy.



The actor expressed anger over rumours and speculation reported in the media doubting his account, including that it was a date gone wrong.



“It’s offensive. And I absolutely resent that narrative,” Smollett said.



“It feels like if I had said [his attacker] was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more.”

The initial reports of the attack shocked the entertainment industry and brought waves of support from advocacy groups.

Members of the “Empire” production team and cast, as well as the studio that produces the program, spoke out in support of the actor, as did the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups."

The announcement followed the earlier arrest of two Nigerian brothers on suspicion of assault and battery in the case, one of whom had appeared on “Empire.”

CPD confirmed Friday that the individuals arrested were black men, according to The Associated Press.

Smollett was allegedly attacked on Jan. 29. He claimed two men said racial and homophobic slurs, beat him up, poured an unknown substance on him and said “This is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country.” (RELATED: Chicago Police Say ‘Empire’ Actor Refuses To Turn Over Phone Records During Alleged ‘MAGA’ Attack)

Several media outlets and journalists circulated allegations from sources that Smollett and the two men planned the attack. Guglielmi, however, said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate” in a Twitter post Thursday.

The two are bodybuilders who use the gym in Smollett's luxury apartment building and are said to know the Empire star.

They were arrested on suspicion of battery but police said they are being released due to 'new evidence'.

Brothers Abimbola Osundairo, 25, and Olabinjo Osundairo, 27, were released Friday night without having been charged after having been questioned by Chicago police amid unsubstantiated claims from local media that they may have helped Empire actor Jussie Smollett stage last month's racist, homophobic attack

The actor, pictured, wept as he said 'who the f*** would make that up' when addressing the skepticism surrounding his version of events. Smollett told Good Morning America he was heartbroken that his story was being questioned

The Osundairo brothers were collared on Wednesday night at Chicago O’Hare airport, as they returned from a trip to visit family in Nigeria.

Their shared apartment was also raided by police, who took away bottles of bleach and a pair of Nike shoes.

Although the property is shared with other family members, there was no answer when DailyMail.com visited the home earlier today – although evidence of the police raid could be seen in the badly dented door.

The two men had flown to Africa the day after the January 29 attack on Smollett which took place close to his apartment building on East Water Street.

Smollett, 36, initially said the attack appeared to be racially motivated and claimed his assailants shouted ‘this is MAGA-land’ as they punched and kicked him.

He also told police he did not recognize his attackers. Cops later released a grainy video showing two men, now understood to be the Osundairo brothers, walking away from the crime scene.

Although Smollett said he did not know who attacked him, both brothers are known to the actor and he follows them on social media.

Their shared Instagram account also features a video of them working out at the private gym in Smollett’s luxury apartment block.

Both have also made cameo appearances in Empire, as well as on cop show Chicago PD. They now produce bodybuilding videos while Olabinjo also works as head of security at local bar Whiskey Business, according to his social media profiles.

Chicago PD confirmed on Thursday that the pair seen in this image from surveillance footage around the time of the attack on January 29 (above) were the two people in custody. DailyMail.com can confirm that those people are Abel and Ola Osundairo

According to court documents obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, Olabinjo was sentenced to two years’ probation and fined $674 in September 2012 after pleading guilty to a single count of aggravated battery in a public place.

The 27-year-old was originally charged with attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery causing great bodily harm, one of aggravated battery with an air rifle, two of aggravated battery in a public place and one of unlawful restraint.

All charges except one of aggravated battery were thrown out, according to a disposition document.

Younger brother Abimbola, 25, is also no stranger to the law and was booked on DUI and speeding charges in July 2015 according to Chicago arrest records.

PIO Anthony Guglielmi said the pair spent Friday morning being interrogated in the presence of their attorney Gloria Schmidt.

He also revealed that cops are yet to find video documenting the alleged attack on Smollett but insisted that the department have found no evidence of a hoax and that the actor ‘continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect’.

Guglielmi added: 'Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.'

On Thursday, Schmidt told CBS Chicago that her clients were ‘baffled’ by their arrest and had been left 'horrified' by the attack on Smollett.

She added: 'When they first learned what happened to him [Smollett], they were horrified. This is someone they know.

'This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don't want to see somebody go through that. They are really baffled why they are people of interest.

'They really don't understand how they even got information that linked them to this horrific crime, but they are not guilty of it.'

Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said Friday night that the individuals were released ""due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations.""

""Detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Guglielmi tweeted.

Police had classified the two men as ""potential suspects"" after identifying them as ""persons of interest"" who were in the area where Smollett said he was attacked in the early morning hours of Jan. 29. Smollett, who is openly gay, told police two men yelled racist and anti-gay slurs, hit him in the face, poured a bleach-like chemical on him, and tied a rope around his neck.

Around 7:30 p.m. local time, the men were still being questioned by police, according to Guglielmi. Less than two hours later, he tweeted that they had been released without being charged.

The two are brothers who worked as extras on Empire and occasionally went to the gym with Smollett, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS Chicago on Thursday.

The brothers were returning from a trip to Nigeria when police detained them at Chicago O'Hare Airport on Wednesday, Schmidt told the local station.

It was not immediately clear what ""new evidence"" police were looking into Friday. A police spokesperson told BuzzFeed News she did not have any additional information.

In a Good Morning America interview that aired Thursday morning, Smollett said he was ""pissed off"" that some were doubting his claims because police weren't immediately able to find surveillance footage verifying his report. Others have been critical of his decision to send police redacted phone records that investigators deemed ""not sufficient in a criminal case.""

""At first it was a thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it ’cause it’s the truth,” Smollett said.



Smollett also said he believed the two dark figures seen in grainy surveillance images released by police were the men who attacked him.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the #Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Ahern wrote.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT SAYS HE'S 'PISSED OFF' AFTER ALLEGED ATTACK IN CHICAGO

No description of the evidence was disclosed.

The two men — whom police have identified only as Nigerian brothers — were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday and taken into custody after returning from Nigeria after police learned that at least one of the men worked on ""Empire,"" according to police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. He said he did not know what the man's job was on the television drama.

Guglielmi's comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed. Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea ""patently ridiculous.""

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told the Chicago Police Department that he was attacked by two men on Jan. 29 while walking home to his apartment. He alleged the men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him.

Responding officers, according to a police report, found Smollett with a rope hanging from his neck. Chicago police told Fox News it was a “small white rope, like the type you’d buy in a hardware store.”

“The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

The two men detained, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on “Empire,” Guglielmi said earlier. He said he did not know what the man’s job was.

Guglielmi earlier also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police earlier this week said there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Smollett, 36, has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. He said police also are contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation.

“Case Update: Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter. No further details were provided.

The men were released about two hours after CPD announced there would be no news conferences in the Smollett investigation out of respect for the victims of a mass shooting that occurred in the Chicago suburb of Aurora earlier Friday.

Representatives for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TheWrap.

It was not clear if the two men arrested Friday were the same as the two men taken into custody as “persons of interest” by Chicago police on Wednesday night. Their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, did not respond to requests for comment.

Smollett was hospitalized on Jan. 29, and reported to police that he was assaulted near his Chicago home by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.” According to a police statement, the actor reported that he was battered “about the face,” that “an unknown chemical substance” was poured on him, and that the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police later shared surveillance footage of two men they identified as “persons of interest.”

In his first public interview since the incident, Smollett told “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts on Wednesday that he was certain the two men in the surveillance footage were the men who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he said. “Never did.”

Smollett also pushed back against people who have questioned his account of the attack, telling Roberts: “Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ’cause it’s the truth.”

Police have said that Smollett continues to be considered a victim in relation to the investigation, contesting two recent news reports saying investigators have raised the possibility that Smollett may have orchestrated the attack himself.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” Chicago police tweeted Thursday. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”"

The attorney for the two Nigerian brothers told CBS Chicago that both know Smollett from ""Empire,"" and that they go to the same gym. The attorney denied that the men had attacked Smollett.

Local media has reported that investigators are looking into whether the incident was staged. The Chicago Police Department has said that it had no confirmation that it was staged.

Police searched the home of the two brothers on Wednesday night, finding electronics, shoes, and bleach, according to local reports.

Guglielmi said earlier that Smollett is still being treated as a victim.

Fox issued a statement on Thursday standing by the actor, and strongly dismissing a report that Smollett may have acted out because he was being written off the show."

The two men, who are brothers, were picked up at the airport Wednesday night and brought in for questioning after police said it appeared they had been in the vicinity of the alleged Jan. 29 attack.

They have not been identified, but Chicago media reported they are in their 20s and originally hail from Nigeria; one of them is said to have appeared on Empire.

On Thursday night, Guglielmi took the unusual step of putting out a statement on Twitter saying reports that detectives believed Smollett and the two brothers had staged the attack were “unconfirmed” and “inaccurate.”

Earlier this week, Smollett, 36, appeared on ABC’s Good Morning America to express outrage that some doubted his account of what happened.

“It’s unbelievable to me that anything of this has come to this,” he said. “That every single thing that I have done, every single thing that I have cooperated with, somehow has gotten twisted into being some bull that it’s not.”"

Chicago police on Friday night released two persons of interest without charging them in the alleged hate attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago Police said in a tweet Friday night.

Earlier on Friday, police said they were questioning two men who were taken into custody at O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday night after returning from a trip to Nigeria.

The pair, who are brothers originally from the African country, have a relationship with Smollett, Chicago Police said — fueling speculation the attack may have been staged.

Smollett alleged he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, and walking home from a Subway restaurant in Chicago at 2 a.m. Jan. 29 when he was accosted by two people who shouted racial slurs, tied a noose around his neck and doused him with a “chemical substance” resembling bleach.

Chicago police had a 48-hour window to charge the brothers, which ended on Friday night."

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Chicago police spokesman Tom Ahern said.

The news comes hours after police said the suspects were arrested and were being interrogated.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement, noting no charges had been filed at the time.

Two brothers affiliated with ""Empire"" were picked up for questioning as they arrived at O'Hare International Airport Wednesday evening, according to authorities. At the time, they were classified as ""persons of interest.""

Police did not elaborate on the brothers' roles on the show.

The Chicago Police Department threw cold water on reports Thursday night that Smollett staged his own attack in response to his character being written off of the show.

""Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,"" CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted. ""Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

A CBS reporter also tweeted the theory, citing ""top sources.""

A statement from 20th Century Fox Television, which produces ""Empire,"" denied that Smollett was being taken off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous,"" it reads. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Police first said they identified and were questioning two persons of interest in the case Thursday morning.

""After a meticulous investigation with the use of advanced technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records, detectives have identified two persons of interest in the Empire cast member case,"" police said in a statement.

The development came on the same morning Smollett's first television interview since the alleged attack aired.

“We are pleased there is progress in the case and are waiting to hear further details,"" a spokesperson for Smollett said in a statement.

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that two masked men punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's account to detectives included that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The alleged attack occurred in the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street about 2 a.m. as the actor returned home from an early-morning visit to a Subway restaurant, according to the police report.

Smollett said in the interview that he was left in shock after the incident and inititally didnt want to report it to police.

""I was looking at myself, just like checking myself out. I saw the bruise on my neck, you know, like the little -- the rope burn around my neck,"" he said. ""So when the police came I kept the clothes on, I kept the rope on me... I mean, it wasn't, like, wrapped around. But, yeah, it was around because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett said he's ""pissed off"" not just by the attack itself but by those questioning his story.

""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f-----, they called me a n------. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

The Chicago police report lists the weapon in the alleged attack as ""hand, feet, teeth, etc.""

""He is a victim,"" Chicago police Supt. Eddie Johnson recently said of Smollett. ""And we treat him like a victim. He's been very cooperative.""

Hours of surveillance video from multiple cameras in the area where Smollett says the attack happened were reviewed, but police have said no footage of an attack has been found.

Smollett handed over redacted phone records to Chicago police Monday, but authorities said the records ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limted and heavily redacted.""

A representative for Smollett said the redacted records were to protect the privacy of his contacts.

""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that,"" Smollett said in the interview. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my castmate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""

Only one image has been released of possible ""persons of interest."" It remained unclear if the two in the photo are the men currently being questioned.

""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them,"" Smollett said in the interview. ""Never did."""

The men were released after new evidence came to light as detectives interrogated them, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Guglielmi said in a tweet.

The attorney representing the men, Gloria Schmidt, said outside a South Side police station that “justice prevailed” for her clients.

“My guys are walking home,” Schmidt told reporters. “They are not charged. They are not suspects in this case.’’

The men, who are brothers, were picked up by police at O’Hare Airport Wednesday night after they returned from a trip to Nigeria, Schmidt said, confirming previous reporting from the Chicago Sun-Times.

Initially considered “persons of interest,” they were arrested while being questioned by detectives Friday morning. Earlier in the day, Guglielmi said: “Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime, and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.”

But Friday night police said the two are no longer being classified as suspects.

Detectives had believed the men were the same people shown in a surveillance image released by police days after the purported attack, Guglielmi said. Police thought the men had yelled racial and homophobic slurs during the incident, which had been investigated as a possible hate crime.

The men’s identities were not officially released, though several gossip websites published their names after they were taken into custody.

Before the brothers were released, Schmidt told reporters that their arrests came as a surprise because her clients knew Smollett.

“They have worked with him on ‘Empire,’” she said. “… They’re baffled why they are people of interest.”

Schmidt said she advised the brothers not to speak to the media Friday night but that they will eventually “tell their story.”

The Chicago Sun-Times reported Thursday that police are investigating the possibility that the reported Jan. 29 attack was staged. However, a police spokesman on Friday again stressed that “there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax.”

“The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi said of Smollett.

Smollett has told police that he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 when two people walked up to him, yelled the slurs, hit him in the face, poured a substance — suspected to be bleach — on him and put a “thin, light rope” around his neck.

The actor initially was “reluctant” to call police because of the attention he would generate as a public figure, police said. But his manager eventually called about 40 minutes after the attack.

The actor said he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack. His manager has said that he could hear the attack over the phone and was able to hear the phrase “MAGA country” — the acronym from President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Thirteen days after he reported the attack, Smollett turned over “limited and redacted” phone records from that day to police, though investigators determined they were insufficient to conduct a criminal investigation.

Separately, a letter that the FBI is investigating was sent on Jan. 22 to Fox and “Empire” offices and used “threatening language” toward Smollett, police said. The letter was laced with some type of white, powdery substance, according to Guglielmi.

A celebrity website, GrapeJuice.net, published a picture of the letter with the words, “You will die black f–,” written in letters apparently cut from magazines.

Two men arrested in connection with an alleged attack on ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett have been released without being charged due to new evidence from interrogations on Friday, Chicago police said.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

The men are no longer being classified as suspects, police said early Saturday.

Smollett filed a report with the Chicago Police Department on Jan. 29 stating that two masked men hurled racist and homophobic slurs before beating him. The actor also said his attackers poured what he thought was bleach over him and put a noose around his neck.

The department said it was investigating the alleged attack against Smollett, who is black and gay, as a possible hate crime.

Police spokesman Tom Ahern said earlier Friday that two men whom police had been questioning in relation to the alleged attack were arrested and were being questioned but had not been charged.

Police said the two men, who are brothers, are believed to be the men in a still image released earlier by police. The image was taken from surveillance video on the night of the attack.

An attorney for the men, Gloria Schmidt, told reporters after they were released without charges Friday night that ""innocence prevailed.""

""My guys are walking home. They're not charged, they are not suspects in this case,"" Schmidt said.

The men were picked up by officers at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from their native country of Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their home.

At least one of the men has worked on ""Empire,"" the show Smollett stars in, Guglielmi has said.

Guglielmi said in a tweet Thursday that the brothers were in an ""area of concern."" Police had previously released pictures taken from surveillance cameras of two ""potential people of interest"" in the case.

Later on Thursday, Guglielmi tweeted in response to local reports that cited unnamed sources saying that police are looking at whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack.

Guglielmi said the reports are unconfirmed and that police Supt. Eddie Johnson had contacted one Chicago news outlet to inform them that ""their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

Some social media users began to cast doubt on Smollett's claims after police said they were not able to find footage of the alleged attack after going through a voluminous amount of recordings from the many surveillance cameras in the area.

Police also said Smollett refused to turn over his phone and phone records for the investigation. The actor had told police he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack. Police have said, however, that Smollett was cooperating with the investigation, andlater gave investigators a PDF file with partial phone records.

In an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday, Smollett said he was upset that some people questioned whether the attack occurred.

""It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, 'cause it's the truth,'"" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It's the truth.'""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, and that says a lot about the place we are in our country right now,"" he said."

9:25 p.m.

Chicago police say they have released two Nigerian brothers who had been arrested earlier in the week on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, saying that detectives have additional investigative work to complete.

The men were picked up by police Wednesday at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and their apartment was searched Thursday. They were questioned Friday but police were obliged to release them if they had not been charged within 48 hours.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted: “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charges.”

Smollett says he was assaulted on Jan. 29 by two men who shouted racial slurs and put a rope around his neck.

___

2:05 p.m.

A Chicago police spokesman confirms that the two suspects arrested in the reported hate crime involving black actor Jussie Smollett are black.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi also says the suspects were arrested on suspicion of assault and battery. He says department policy prohibits him from naming the victim but says that he can say the two Nigerian brothers were arrested in connection with the case involving the “‘Empire’ cast member.” Smollett is an actor on the television drama and has said he was beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack last month.

Guglielmi also says at least one of the men in custody worked on “Empire,” but he does not know in what capacity.

The men are being interrogated Friday by detectives. Police picked them up Wednesday at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport after they flew from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their Chicago apartment.

___

9:55 a.m.

Chicago Police say the two men being questioned in the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett are considered suspects.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said Friday that the men are in custody and have been arrested based on probable cause that they may have been involved in a crime. But he says they have not been charged in the Jan. 29 attack.

Police have identified the men only as two Nigerian brothers. Police have been questioning them since they were picked up by officers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their home.

Guglielmi says at least one of the men worked on “Empire,” but he does not know in what capacity.

Smollett told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men are the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

___

8:40 a.m.

Chicago police says local media reports that allege the attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support the reporting. Guglielmi says Johnson said the supposed police “sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

The reports surfaced late Thursday as investigators questioned two “persons of interest” in the case who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area where Smollett says he was attacked.

The actor says two masked men beat him after shouting racial and homophobic slurs and tied a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Producers of the television drama also dispute that Smollett’s character is being written off the show, calling the reports “patently ridiculous.”

Police did not elaborate on the brothers' roles on the show.

""Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,"" CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted. ""Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

A CBS reporter also tweeted the theory, citing ""top sources.""

A statement from 20th Century Fox Television, which produces ""Empire,"" denied that Smollett was being taken off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous,"" it reads. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Police first said they identified and were questioning two persons of interest in the case Thursday morning.

""After a meticulous investigation with the use of advanced technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records, detectives have identified two persons of interest in the Empire cast member case,"" police said in a statement.

The development came on the same morning Smollett's first television interview since the alleged attack aired.

“We are pleased there is progress in the case and are waiting to hear further details,"" a spokesperson for Smollett said in a statement.

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that two masked men punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's account to detectives included that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The alleged attack occurred in the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street about 2 a.m. as the actor returned home from an early-morning visit to a Subway restaurant, according to the police report.

Smollett said in the interview that he was left in shock after the incident and inititally didnt want to report it to police.

""I was looking at myself, just like checking myself out. I saw the bruise on my neck, you know, like the little -- the rope burn around my neck,"" he said. ""So when the police came I kept the clothes on, I kept the rope on me... I mean, it wasn't, like, wrapped around. But, yeah, it was around because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett said he's ""pissed off"" not just by the attack itself but by those questioning his story.

""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f-----, they called me a n------. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

The Chicago police report lists the weapon in the alleged attack as ""hand, feet, teeth, etc.""

""He is a victim,"" Chicago police Supt. Eddie Johnson recently said of Smollett. ""And we treat him like a victim. He's been very cooperative.""

Hours of surveillance video from multiple cameras in the area where Smollett says the attack happened were reviewed, but police have said no footage of an attack has been found.

Smollett handed over redacted phone records to Chicago police Monday, but authorities said the records ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limted and heavily redacted.""

A representative for Smollett said the redacted records were to protect the privacy of his contacts.

""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that,"" Smollett said in the interview. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my castmate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""

Only one image has been released of possible ""persons of interest."" It remained unclear if the two in the photo are the men currently being questioned.

""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them,"" Smollett said in the interview. ""Never did."""

Also on Friday, defense attorney Michael Monico confirmed to Variety that he is now representing Smollett, one of the stars of “Empire.” On Saturday, however, Smollett’s representatives denied that Smollett had hired Monico.

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that two men attacked him, yelled homophobic and racial slurs, poured bleach on him, and put a rope around his neck. Local media has reported that investigators are looking into whether the incident was staged. The Chicago Police Department has said that it had no evidence of that, and that Smollett is still being treated as a victim.

Monico is a high-powered defense attorney with decades of experience. He recently represented Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, in his criminal case.

The two men released Friday evening — who police have not officially identified — had been under arrest, though police never disclosed what charges they could potentially face. The attorney for the two Nigerian brothers told CBS Chicago that both know Smollett from “Empire,” and that they go to the same gym. The attorney denied that the men had attacked Smollett.

Police searched the home of the two brothers on Wednesday night, finding electronics, shoes, and bleach, according to local reports.

Fox issued a statement on Thursday standing by the actor, and strongly dismissing a report that Smollett may have acted out because he was being written off the show."

At least one of the men worked on the TV show, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said authorities had probable cause to believe the suspects committed assault and battery against Smollett. But they had not been charged as of Friday afternoon.

Guglielmi would not comment on a possible motive.

Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

The police spokesman said that there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

The two suspects, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on “Empire,” Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man’s job was.

Guglielmi said police also searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

The police spokesman’s comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax.

Police said those reports were unconfirmed. And the producers of “Empire” disputed as “patently ridiculous” news reports that Smollett’s character was being written out of the show before the attack.

Smollett, 36, has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. He said police also are contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because of privacy concerns. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for 3 to 4 hours. I’m sorry but – I’m not gonna do that,” Smollett said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmates’ numbers, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”"

The Blast reports that Abel and Ola Osundairo were once both in massive amounts of debt due to student loans and other expenses. According to the article, their financial status was so dire that they both filed for bankruptcy in 2016.

In documents reportedly obtained by the celebrity news site, Ola claims to have had $161,481 in debt, with the majority of that resulting from student loans. As for Abel, his debt was allegedly $72,771 with almost $40,000 in student loans. They both claimed to be earning less than $200 a month.

The brothers cited a party store in Chicago as an “asset,” but The Blast reports that the business has closed and that it was not operating at a profit when it was open.

In the end, the brothers’ bankruptcy was discharged, which means that they were released from their liabilities.

As TMZ previously reported, both men were arrested in connection to the attack on the Empire actor and the police are now referring to them as “potential suspects” instead of “persons of interest.” Police also raided their home and found materials that were used during the attack, according to the account offered by Smollett. Both brothers were extras on the show, which has led some to speculate that the actor may have colluded with them to stage the attack.

This speculation was bolstered by reports from two different Chicago-based reporters who said that their sources had told them that Smollet set up the attack because he believed that he was being written off the show. As the Inquisitr reported, the Chicago Police Department’s spokesperson, Anthony Guglielmi, said that the reports are “unconfirmed.”

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” he tweeted. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Jussie Smollett, who has had a major role on Empire since its first season, has claimed that two men physically assaulted him on January 29 while hurling racist and homophobic slurs. He also alleged that both men poured a chemical substance on him which is believed to have been bleach. As CNN reports, early stories about the attack claimed that the men were wearing red “Make America Great Again” hats. Smollett later said that was untrue.

Olabinjo Osundairo, 27, was sentenced to two years’ probation and fined $674 in September 2012 after pleading guilty to a single count of aggravated battery in a public place.

Bodybuilder Osundairo was originally charged with attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery causing great bodily harm, one of aggravated battery with an air rifle, two of aggravated battery in a public place and one of unlawful restraint.

All charges except one of aggravated battery were thrown out, according to a disposition document obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com.

Younger brother Abimbola, 25, is also no stranger to the law and was booked on DUI and speeding charges in July 2015 according to Chicago arrest records.

Police said on Friday that they are being released due to 'new evidence'.

The Osundairo brothers were collared on Wednesday night at Chicago O’Hare airport, as they returned from a trip to visit family in Nigeria.

Their shared apartment was also raided by police, who took away bottles of bleach and a pair of Nike shoes.

Although the property is shared with other family members, there was no answer when DailyMail.com visited the home earlier today – although evidence of the police raid could be seen in the badly dented door.

The two men had flown to Africa the day after the January 29 attack on Smollett which took place close to his apartment building on East Water Street.

Smollett, 36, initially said the attack appeared to be racially motivated and claimed his assailants shouted ‘this is MAGA-land’ as they punched and kicked him.

He also told police he did not recognize his attackers. Cops later released a grainy video showing two men walking away from the crime scene.

Although Smollett said he did not know who attacked him, both brothers are known to the actor and he follows them on social media.

Their shared Instagram account also features a video of them working out at the private gym in Smollett’s luxury apartment block.

Both have also made cameo appearances in Empire, as well as on cop show Chicago PD. They now produce bodybuilding videos while Olabinjo also works as head of security at local bar Whiskey Business, according to his social media profiles.

In the latest twist of the strange and illusive saga surrounding Jussie Smollett, two Nigerian brothers who “have a relationship” with the “Empire” actor were taken into custody in connection with his alleged attack — but later released by Chicago police.

The two men — budding models and actors Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — were initially detained on suspicion of assault and battery for the alleged hate attack on the actor, according to police.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement on Friday.

But hours later, Chicago Police said the grilling of the brawny brothers revealed new information that led to them being let loose.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging,” Guglielmi said.

“Detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

Chicago cops said the brothers “have a relationship” with Smollett. Their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, said the brothers have worked on Smollett’s hit Fox drama, and that the three of them are gym buddies who worked out together.

Ola played a prison inmate on ­“Empire” and had a part on the NBC series “Chicago P.D.” last year, according to TMZ and his IMDb page.

Smollett is one of the brothers’ nearly 19,000 followers on their joint Instagram account, which features photos of the duo pumping iron.

Smollett, 36, plays Jamal Lyon — the gay son of hip-hop mogul Lucious and Lucious’ wife, Cookie, who struggles to win his ­father’s approval — on the Golden Globe-nominated show.

Smollett, who is also a singer-songwriter, is gay.

Friday’s developments were the latest in the tale that began Jan. 29, when the alleged attack took place — and has since created a firestorm of controversy, including theories that the entire incident was a hoax perpetrated by Smollett to save himself from getting written off the show.

Smollett has said he had just flown back to Chicago, where he lives in the ritzy Streeterville neighborhood, and popped out at around 2 a.m. to grab a bite to eat for himself and his creative director, Frank Gatson.

Smollett said he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, and crossing a street when someone snarled, “Empire.”

“And I don’t answer to ‘Empire.’ My name ain’t ‘Empire,’ ” Smollett recalled Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

“I kept walking, and then I heard, ‘F—-t, Empire n—-r.’ So I turned around and I said, ‘The f–k did you just say to me?’ ”

That’s when one of two attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country, n—-r!” — a reference to President Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again” — and punched him in the face, Smollett said.

The trio began tussling near a set of stairs on East Lower North Water Street before the men bolted on foot, the actor said.

Smollett said he called Moore and told him, “I was just jumped!” — and then noticed a rope around his neck.

“I started screaming, I said, ‘There’s a f–king rope around my neck!’ ” he recalled.

He admitted he was reluctant to report the attack to police.

“Victim did not want to report offense, however, he believed it to be in the best interest to,” the police report said.

The responding officers arrived at Smollett’s home “to find him with white rope draped around neck” and stained clothing from a “chemical substance” that Smollett said the men doused him with, the police report said.

He alluded on “GMA” that his attackers were white.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel the doubters would’ve supported me a lot much more,” he said. “That says a lot about the place that we are in this country right now.”

Several other issues with Smollett’s story also have popped up.

The official police report, based on his account, makes no mention of attackers shouting, “This is MAGA country, n—-r.” It only indicates that they yelled, “Empire, f—-t, n—-r.”

The alleged beatdown occurred in a part of the street where there are no surveillance cameras.

Smollett also has been unable or unwilling to provide details of his attackers, who he only said were masked and dressed in all black.

“I can’t tell you what color their eyes were, and I did not see anything except the second person I saw running away,” Smollett said. “And the first person, I saw his stature. I gave the description as best as I could.”

Smollett has also been scrutinized for not immediately turning over his phone records to corroborate his story — and handing over only heavily redacted copies 13 days after the incident.

He has defended the move, saying it was to protect his privacy.

Abel and Ola Osundairo reportedly flew from the US to Nigeria the day of the incident and were arrested between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. Wednesday at O’Hare International Airport after flying back to Chicago, said Guglielmi, the police spokesman.

The busts of the “Empire”-linked actors fueled reports by Chicago’s ABC and CBS affiliates, which cited numerous sources claiming the brothers helped Smollett stage the attack because he was about to be written off the show.

That theory has been heavily disputed by both police and 21st Century Fox Television executives.

Police also have issued statements reiterating that Smollett is being treated as a “victim” and not a “suspect.”

When police raided the brothers’ Chicago home, they seized bleach, a “black face-mask hat’’ and other items, cops said.

Their lawyer said they were in no way involved in the attack.

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” Schmidt told CBS News. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

Grainy surveillance video from the area did capture two men walking along a nearby street just before the incident.

Police have not confirmed whether the Osundairo brothers are the men in the video, but Smollett has said he is certain the pair in the footage — whoever they are — is responsible for his assault.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he said. “Never did.”"

When Eyman is not busy bankrupting transit funds with his $30 car tab initiative , he's apparently jacking a $70 office chair from an Office Depot in Lacey, WA. According to the Times , footage from the store shows Eyman wearing one of his signature ""Let The Voters Decide"" long sleeve t-shirts as he ""reclines, spins around three times and then stands up and wheels the chair out of the store."" He then goes back into the store to drop a couple hundred dollars on printers. An employee told the police that Eyman ""acted wary"" when he offered to help carry the printers to the car, and then insisted he ""leave the printers on the ground next to his vehicle"" when he got out there. KEY DETAIL: ""The store manager identified Eyman based on his phone number, payment method and, the police report says.""

Eyman didn't respond to my calls, but in a statement e-mailed to reporters he said he's contacted the Lacey Office Depot and is ""expecting a call from the officer in charge to explain what happened,"" adding that he plans to ""cooperate fully"" and ""do whatever is required"" of him. ""It's time Tim Eyman spent some quality time in jail,"" said Eyman's anti-boyfriend, Andrew Villeneuve of Northwest Progressive Institute.

Donald Trump says he didn't need to declare a national emergency for wall funding: ""I could do the wall over a longer period of time.

I'm very much looking forward to reading Justice's Brett Kavanaugh's argument in favor of a President's ability to declare a national emergency that he admits is not an emergency.

Chuck and Nancy aren't having it: “The President’s actions clearly violate the Congress’s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution,"" Pelosi and Schumer said in a statement.

Congressional Democrats aren't having it: The House Judiciary Committee says it's investigating Trumps decision, per Axios. Democrats are also expected to draw up a resolution rejecting Trump's executive order, which, if nothing else, would force Republicans to go on the record allowing the executive branch to encroach upon the central powers of the legislative branch.

Even some Republicans aren't having it: But nobody who really matters. Senators Rubio, Paul, Collins, Murkowski, Alexander, and Toomey all expressed opposition.

A lawsuit has already been filed: On Friday afternoon a group representing Texas landowners filed the first lawsuit against's Trump's declaration, according to Buzzfeed. The ACLU is also expected to file suit soon.

Democrats are already introducing bills declaring a ""national emergency"" on climate change: Look what you started, Trump! In a letter to Congress, Rep.

Maine State Police arrested Steven H. Downs in connection with the killing of 20-year-old Sophie Sergie in April of 1993 at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

Police in Alaska said DNA evidence linked Downs to the crime. He was charged with first-degree murder and sex assault.

Downs, a nurse, was arrested by the Maine State Police Tactical Team late Friday afternoon in the parking lot at the Fireside Inn. Police also searched his home at 132 Hillcrest St. where they obtained a DNA sample, according to a criminal complaint.

“This arrest is the culmination of years of effort and tenacious attention by the department to solve a horrendous murder,” wrote Amanda Price, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Public Safety. “I and the entire department send our heartfelt sympathy to the family of Sophie Sergie and hope this arrest brings some sense of peace.”

A reporter at the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner said of the killing “The Sophie Sergie homicide case is one of the most notorious cases up here.”

According to a reporter at that news agency, Downs was a student a the University of Alaska at Fairbanks from 1992 to 1996.

Police said On April 26, 1993, custodial workers at the UAF campus discovered Sophie Sergie’s body in a women’s bathroom of the Bartlett Hall, a dormitory in which Downs lived. Sophie, a resident of Pitkas Point and previous student at UAF, was in town on personal business and visiting friends on campus.

According to a criminal complaint, Sergie had been sexually assaulted, stabbed multiple times and shot in the back of the head before her body was placed in a bathtub.

An investigation was launched by the UAF Campus Police, but was soon taken over by the Alaska State Troopers. Suspect DNA was recovered during the investigation and a unique suspect profile was identified from the DNA; the information was uploaded into “CODIS” – a national Combined DNA Index System.

Police said that last year, investigators learned of new DNA technologies that might help lead them to the killer. More testing was done and, police said, results revealed that the likely suspect was Downs, who they tracked to Auburn.

Police from Alaska came to Auburn on Monday, according to Maine Public Safety Spokesman Stephen McCausland. They worked with Auburn and State Police over the past few days before Downs was arrested without incident outside the Washington Street hotel.

Downs was being held at the Androscoggin County Jail in Auburn Friday night. He is expected to be returned to Alaska to face the charges.

Court records did not show a criminal history for Downs in the Lewiston-Auburn area.

A little bit over an hour after a Chicago PD spokesman said that the department had canceled a planned press conference on the status of the two brothers brought in a couple of days ago and arrested today related to the attack in the early morning of January 29, the men have been released due to unexplained “new evidence”:

Case Update: Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete. pic.twitter.com/Hswn1Qjgcy — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 16, 2019

The release of Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo at near 9 PM Chicago time surely means that whatever that “new evidence” is, it is a clear game changer for the ever twisting and turning Empire star case.

The cops have also confirmed that the brothers are the two individuals that were shown in the photographs previously released depicting “persons of interest” in the case.

Adding to that, there are incorrect reports that Smollett has now lawyered-up with ex-Trump fixer Michael Cohen’s lawyer Michael Monico. Actually, while there were discussed with Monico, the Empire star has hired attorneys Victor P. Henderson and Todd Pugh being retained by him. Coming from separate firms, the Chicago-based lawyers specialize in criminal defense, perhaps a telling sign.

PREVIOUSLY, 6:20 PM: A planned update on the status of the Jussie Smollett alleged assault case has been put on hold indefinitely by the Chicago police department because of the shooting tragedy today in nearby Aurora, Illinois.

With two suspects in custody and still being questioned by detectives, Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi just alerted the situation of the Empire star via social media:

There will be no press conferences in the Empire case as our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of #AuroraShooting. At this hour, individuals are still talking to detectives. pic.twitter.com/8vlAougfsw — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 16, 2019

There were five deaths and multiple police officers injured from the now deceased active shooter at the Henry Pratt Company later on Friday in Aurora. Today’s terrible Aurora massacre is not to be confused with Aurora, Colorado where there was a mass shooting that left 12 dead and 58 wounded from gun fire at a screening of The Dark Knight Returns in 2012.

Even due to the President’s Day holiday on February 8, being that the arrested Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo have been in custody for near 48 hours, the duo could be formally charged by midnight in the Windy City – or have to be released

To that end, and as the investigation by a variety of agencies continues in the Chicago suburb, any press conference or update in the Smollett case is looking more like it too will happen in the next day or so.

Almost three weeks after the Empire actor was supposedly violently attacked in the early hours of January 29 by a duo chanting racist and homophobic slurs, the Osundairo brothers were brought in formally on suspicion of assault and battery by cops Friday

At least one of the brothers, who were picked up returning to Chicago at O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday, has appeared as an extra in the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong co-created series in its second season.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime,” said Chicago PD spokesman Guglielmi declared earlier Friday of the arrested siblings.

This comes one day after local media were slammed by police for “unconfirmed” and “inaccurate” reports that the alleged assault on Smollett in the Windy City was staged as a career move. Soon afterwards, Empire broadcaster Fox soundly rejected suggestions that the actor who plays openly gay Jamal Lyon on the hip hop drama was being written off the series, a reason given in reports earlier in the day claiming the attack was staged.

On February 14, Smollett gave his first sit-down since the January 29 attack to Good Morning America. The actor told co-host Robin Roberts that he thought he was targeted in the street attack last month because of his repeated public criticism of President Donald Trump. Earlier this week Smollett handed over phone records from within the hour of the 2 AM incident. GMA’s Roberts noted in the interview segment that Chicago police said the records were “limited and heavily redacted.”

Asked about the doubts and rumors that have sprung up on social media and elsewhere since the attack, Smollett said, “If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.”"

The 36-year-old actor required hospital treatment after a suspected racist and homophobic attack last month, and Chicago police have confirmed that two brothers — who were previously treated as “potential suspects” — have now been arrested.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained that detectives investigating the incident had “probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.”

The actor has told police he was attacked on Jan. 29, 2019, by two men, who he has accused of launching a racist and homophobic attack on him.

Jussie also discussed the incident on “Good Morning America,” saying it had all happened “so fast” while he was out getting food.

He recalled: “I went to the Subway, got my order.

“During that time I texted my manager, thinking that he was still in Australia … I said, ‘Call me when you can.’ He called me immediately and while he was on the phone, I heard as I was crossing the intersection, ‘Empire!’ And I don’t answer to ‘Empire’, my name ain’t ‘Empire.’

“And I didn’t answer, I kept walking, and then I heard, “f—ing ‘Empire’ n—–.’ So I turned around and I said, ‘What the f— did you just say to me?’ And I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘This MAGA country, n—-,’ and he punched me right in the face. So I punched his ass back and then we started tussling.

“There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back and then it just stopped and they ran off.

“It happened so fast. It felt like minutes but it was probably 30 seconds.”"

They have not yet been charged with any crime.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” Anthony Guglielmi, the spokesman, said in a statement.

The arrests reflected progress in an investigation that started at the end of last month, when Smollett told authorities that he had been attacked early in the morning by two masked men who directed homophobic and racial slurs toward him in downtown Chicago. Smollett also told police that the assailants had tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him.

For weeks, the investigators, who treated the case as a possible hate crime, had few leads. They couldn’t find any surveillance footage that showed any attack. However, within days of the reported incident, police released the images of two men who were in the area, whom police considered “potential persons of interest.” After “meticulous investigation with the use of advanced technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses, and transportation records,” police said, they discerned the two men’s identities and detained them Wednesday night. Also earlier this week, police searched their home as part of the investigation.

The revelation that at least one of the men appeared on “Empire” (although it is unknown in what role), fueled social media speculation that at least parts of Smollett’s story were not true. However, Guglielmi said that there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax.”

A lawyer for the two men did not respond to emails and calls requesting comment.

In an interview broadcast Thursday morning on “Good Morning America,” Smollett expressed frustration that his story was being doubted.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,” Smollett told ABC’s Robin Roberts. “A lot more.”

He also said that he was sure that the men in the surveillance images were the ones who attacked him that night.

“Because I was there,” Smollett said. “For me, when that was released, I was like, ‘OK, we’re getting somewhere.’ I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

A spokeswoman for Smollett said late Thursday that the actor had continued answering “routine follow-up questions” from police during the day. She did not respond to a request for comment Friday about the men now being considered “potential suspects.”"

The star of the new Netflix series The Umbrella Academy, Ellen Page, has been making the talk show rounds to promote the program. But she also continues to be an outspoken activist for LGBTQ visibility and rights. On Friday she appeared on Ellen DeGeneres’s show to promote the series, but DeGeneres led off with a series of questions about Page’s recent activism.

And DeGeneres, who recently took heat for appearing to pardon Kevin Hart’s homophobic tweets and statements on behalf of all LGBTQ people, praised Page for her activism while also admitting that with the continual horrifying news cycle, she sometimes keeps her head down.

“I think most of us, we’re so bombarded. You watch the news … we’re bombarded with horrible things going on all the time in every area. Not just antigay. It’s everything,” DeGeneres said. “I think sometimes we just keep our heads down and we keep trying to do what we can.”

The conversation kicked off with DeGeneres commending Page for her appearance on Stephen Colbert’s show following news of an attack on actor Jussie Smollett in which the Juno star railed against the Trump administration and Mike Pence for fomenting anti-LGBTQ hatred.

“I texted you right after I saw that and I also texted Stephen. I just thought it was amazing,” DeGeneres said, noting that the moment had not been planned.

“What people need to know is it’s life or death. People need to know that when you’re growing up in a society that makes you feel like there’s something wrong with you that something needs to be fixed,” Page said after DeGeneres opened the door to discuss what she’d said on Colbert’s show. “It’s extremely dangerous and harmful.”

Page also recently called out actor Chris Pratt for attending an anti-LGBTQ church. Meanwhile, DeGeneres softballed her interview with him.

That’s when DeGeneres pointed out that on Page's series Gaycation, the actress has exhibited the courage to delve into the lives of marginalized, vulnerable LGBTQ people in countries where homosexuality is banned. DeGeneres, who famously came out publicly in 1997 and subsequently had trouble finding work for a few years, then admitted, “We just keep our heads down and we keep trying to do what we can.”

Page, who came out at an LGBTQ youth conference in 2014, responded by speaking about some of the shared experiences of queer people.

“We have so little representation in the media and we don’t learn about LGBTQ history in schools,” Page said. “These are the things that we need. You know what it’s like, Ellen.”

“I do,” DeGeneres replied.

“You know what it’s like to grow up and internalize homophobia and live with that shame that poisons you,” Page said.

“Oh, I do,” DeGeneres agreed.

The Eagles were racking up turnovers faster than points. Passes were being thrown at players’ feet. Shots were sailing over the basket. Layup attempts were being hurled into the rim.

And then, in the nick of time, Gabrielle Wener and her teammates figured it out.

Wener scored 16 points, nine coming in the fourth quarter, and No. 5 Messalonskee rallied to beat equally cold No. 4 Gardiner, 39-33, in the Class A North quarterfinals at the Augusta Civic Center.

“They stayed together,” said Messalonskee coach Keith Derosby, who also got eight points from Alyssa Genness. “It’s just about waiting, trusting that eventually those shots will drop.”

They dropped for Messalonskee, but never did for Gardiner, which went 8-for-49 from the field.

“We said if we hold them under 40, there’s no way we lose this game,” said coach Mike Gray, whose team was led by 11 points and 11 rebounds from Aimee Adams and six points and 10 rebounds from Bailey Poore. “We had a shot, we just didn’t make any shots. That’s what it comes down to. I thought we defended as well as we have all winter, I thought we rebounded as well as we have all winter. They just made shots down the stretch and we didn’t.”

Despite their struggles, the Tigers led for most of the game, and took a 20-19 lead into the fourth quarter. Messalonskee had hit only six of 35 shots at that point, but the Eagles quickly gained some momentum. Emily Parent (seven rebounds) hit a 3-pointer to put the Eagles in front 22-20, and Alyssa Genness, Mackenzie Mayo and Sarah Lowell followed with baskets to bump the lead to 28-21 with 4:43 to play.

Gardiner struck back, getting two free throws from Adams and two baskets from Maggie Bell to make it 28-27. The game was up for grabs again, but the Eagles coaches had noticed a crack in the Gardiner defense.

“My coaching staff, Coach (Tommy) Hill and Coach (Pam) McGuan, were really good about recognizing some of the spacing,” Derosby said. “They recognized that, when Gabrielle was going up to that foul line, how they reacted. So we just started off the foul line, giving her some more space to move.”

Wener quickly benefited from the adjustment. She converted a three-point play to make it 31-27 with 3:02 to go, countered a pair of Gardiner free throws with another basket with 1:47 to go, then had a layup and two free throws to make it 37-31 with 57.2 seconds to play.

“We were able to make those open cuts. My teammates were able to make unbelievable passes, and I was able to finish in the end,” said Wener, who had a double-double with 10 rebounds. “We were a lot more hyped going into the fourth quarter. We were determined that this wasn’t going to be our last game.”

After shooting 17 percent through the first three quarters, the Eagles shot 70 percent in the fourth.

“Gardiner, that’s a great team, coach Gray does a great job. They scheme their defensive plan, switching out of that zone and that man,” Derosby said. “It gave us some fits.”

Particularly in the first half, when a combination of mixed shots and Gardiner’s aggressive defense saw the Eagles trailing 15-11 at halftime.

“I think it’s overthinking sometimes. Knowing what’s being run and trying to counteract that in our head,” Derosby said. “Sometimes instead of catching it and taking a breath, and then making your decision, (they’re) just trying to do everything. Think, pass, shoot, all in one motion. That’s pretty hard to do in this game.”

The Eagles were struggling, but the Tigers couldn’t take advantage. They shot 3-for-21 in the second half, missing a crucial chance to put their opponent away.

In the fourth quarter, it came back to haunt them.

“I think they just didn’t go in,” Gray answered when asked if the shooting struggles were a result of nerves. “They did a really good job of extending the pressure, especially on Jaycie (Stevens) outside. I think if we make a few layups, they can’t cheat out as much as they were, and that’s going to open her up.

“If we made one or two, that might turn things around. We just never could get that stretch where we could get a couple in a row.”

Media reporter for 'The Hill' Joe Concha weighs in on the Jussie Smollett hate crime controversy on Wednesday's 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'





TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: It's looking increasingly possible that the attack you just heard about may not have been the attempted lynching it has been hyped as. But it doesn't matter. It's too late now. To those who only casually follow the news, they will hear only the press' initial breathless coverage which treated the incident as an obvious hate crime, yet another consequence of Donald Trump's America, another Trump voter bashing someone on the street.



Some parts of the media are still treating the story that way despite what we have learned in the last two weeks. A recent piece in the online website, apparently, ""Daily Beast"" argued that we should believe Smollett on the basis of his skin color. That sort of openly racist politically motivated journalism is increasingly the norm.







Covington worked the same way. Supposedly we could tell that a few high school boys were evil because of the way they looked and the way they smiled and the way their parents presumably voted.



Well, take a look at BuzzFeed's supposed smoking gun of the President ordering his lawyer to lie to Congress. There was no proof it was true. There never was any proof of it, but because it matched an established narrative, everybody knew what to call it.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT, CNN: It would be certainly a bombshell information.



JIM SCIUTTO, ANCHOR, CNN: BuzFeed's latest bombshell report.



WOLF BLITZER, ANCHOR, CNN: White House is slamming a bombshell report by BuzzFeed.



UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And in a bombshell report from BuzzFeed.



CHUCK TODD, ANCHOR, MSNBC: If the BuzzFeed bombshell is true.



ERIN BURNETT, ANCHOR, CNN: The bombshell report.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Thesaurus, please. Dumb people have a weakness for news cliches, it's unbelievable. Stuff like that happens every couple of weeks. But nobody in the press ever seems to learn or change? Why is that? Joe Concha writes about this stuff for a living for ""The Hill"" newspaper and he joins us tonight.



So, Joe, I'm recognizing a repetitive pattern of behavior where people who are supposed to soberly digest the facts and bring them to the public are instead jumping to wild conclusions that comport with their political beliefs and then not apologizing or changing that. Why is that?



JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: Because Tucker, how do you learn from when you are a little kid all the way through when you're an adult with a career? You learn by being held accountable for things.



So if you make a major mistake and it's funny because we talked about this, the mistakes are never made, let's put it this way. When was the last time you saw a major mistake in any big journalism piece any big outlet against a Democratic lawmaker.



But when mistakes are made, there is never almost with exceptions ramifications, suspensions, actual firings, so if you know you can get away with something, you just keep doing it.



But one thing I'm noticing with this story here, Tucker, if you google Jussie Smollett and attack, almost every headline I see says ""attack."" There is no word, and it's very key here before it alleged attack. When you take ""alleged"" out, it becomes fact. Like Pearl Harbor was attacked. When you take ""alleged"" out, suddenly it becomes absolute truth.



So, in this case let's put it this way, if I'm a journalist, I remove the noise here. I remove the fact that Smollett is a celebrity. I remove the fact that he is anti-Trump. You know, that's not a big surprise. I remove the fact that these were pro-Trump alleged attackers that went after him and I want to find evidence to support the claim. How do you find the evidence?



Smollett said he was on the phone during the attack with his manager. All right, so a man says he was attacked by two men, right? So if he is on the phone, then, therefore, he should turn over his phone records. When he does, he heavily redacts them and his excuse is that he doesn't want the Chicago Police to see his contacts?



Okay, how about the manager? Has he turned over his phone? Reportedly, he hasn't. So when you take that evidence out of this story, you have to question it.



So when I watch that interview tomorrow with Robin Roberts on ABC, she better press him on that point. Why wouldn't you turn over the only evidence that's available if we haven't seen this on camera?



CARLSON: She is not going to press him on the point. You can be sure about that. But let me ask you this, so I almost feel -- I mean, it looks to me like maybe this guy got over his skis, made up the story. We have seen this a lot. Maybe it's real. I mean, I don't know.



But I do know that two sitting U.S. senators, Harris and Booker both immediately shoot statements calling this a lynching. Now, that scares people. It divides the country. It's racially inflammatory. If it turns out this isn't real, should they be forced to apologize for doing that?



CONCHA: And the only way they will apologize, Tucker, is if the press presses them on that.



CARLSON: Exactly, that's right.



CONCHA: You made this comment. You read back the comment. Now, we have learned and, again, we don't know, but let's say we do learn, what do you have to say now? You know that's not going to happen.



And, look, it's that theme that we talked about over and over again. All Trump stories - not all, almost all come from a foundation of guilty. Whether that's yes, Trump must have collusion with the Russians, therefore, he is guilty. The Covington kids must have attacked the Native American, therefore, he is guilty.



When you come from that foundation, of course, these are the conclusions that are going to be drawn, Tucker.



CARLSON: That's exactly right. I mean, we have known this for generations. Any good editor makes certain that his reporters are honest enough not to act like this. But nobody cares anymore. No one does. Joe Concha, charges thank you. Great to see you."

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said authorities had probable cause to believe the suspects committed assault and battery against Smollett. But they had not been charged as of Friday afternoon.

Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

The police spokesman said that there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

The two suspects, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on “Empire,” Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man’s job was.

The men were identified as Nigerian brothers, The Associated Press reported. CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said both were arrested for suspicion of assault and battery. One of the suspects was on “Empire.”

TMZ reported the names of the suspects, but CPD officer Michelle Tannehill said to The Daily Caller News Foundation over email they “do not have the names of the persons of interest.”

Smollett reported two men beat him up, tied a rope around his neck, said racial and homophobic slurs and threw an unidentified chemical substance on him on Jan. 29, according to The AP.

He claimed that the attackers said “This is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country,” in a follow-up interview with CPD.

TMZ originally reported the alleged attackers were white and they were told twice that their reporting reflected Smollett’s version of events accurately.

CPD said the attack could have been racially motivated in a statement released after the incident was reported. (RELATED: Chicago Police Say ‘Empire’ Actor Refuses To Turn Over Phone Records During Alleged ‘MAGA’ Attack)

The “Empire” star disputed that he ever said the attackers wore MAGA hats in a Good Morning America interview Thursday. Smollett added he believed more people would have supported instead of doubted him had he said the perpetrators were Muslim, Mexican or ‘someone black.’

WATCH:

Several media outlets and journalists circulated allegations from sources that Smollett and the two men were conspirators and the attack was staged. Guglielmi, however, said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate” on Twitter Thursday.

Two Nigerian brothers identified as ""persons of interest"" in the alleged hate attack on Jussie Smollett could face criminal charges, according to their lawyer.

It's unclear what the men, identified as Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, could be charged with, however, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News.

""They are baffled about why they are people of interest,"" Ms Schmidt told the network. ""It's an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it's not my guys.""

She said the men, who have not been identified, worked with Smollett on the set of his hit TV show Empire and worked out with him at the gym.

But she insisted her clients had nothing to do with the alleged assault on January 29 in Chicago - in which Smollett claims two men shouted racist and gay slurs at him, punched him, doused him with a ""chemical substance"" that could've been bleach and threw a noose around his neck.

Ms Schmidt said the brothers were just as stunned as everyone else over the 2am beat down.

""This is someone that they know, this is someone that they've worked with,"" she said. ""So they don't want to see somebody go through that.""

Sources told the Chicago affiliates for both ABC and CBS that investigators were looking into whether the men helped Smollett stage the attack because he was being allegedly set to be written off the show.

The latest reports on the Jussie Smollett attack are getting more and more disturbing.

With two men of Nigerian descent — with connections to Empire — being arrested on Friday, there seems to be some amount of credence being lent to the theory Smollett staged the attack himself.

But why would he do such a thing?

One reporter claimed on Thursday that a working theory was the Empire star was being written off of his hit show.

Frankly we’re not sure why a hate crime is supposed to have stopped that — is the idea that the writers would be afraid to look like they were piling on and reverse course?

In any case, the theory gets tanked by the show itself. We already saw a statement from 20th Century Fox, who said:

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

The show’s writers agreed:

The writers of Empire have never planned or even discussed writing @JussieSmollett off of the show. — Empire Writers (@EmpireWriters) February 15, 2019

And co-creator Danny Strong tweeted:

There is 0% truth that @JussieSmollett was going to be written off of Empire. This rumor is totally false. He is the third lead and one of the most beloved characters on the show. Writing him off the show has NEVER even been discussed. — Danny Strong (@Dannystrong) February 15, 2019

How did this theory come about at all?

We do know there is going to be a big death on the show. A plotline this season involves flashforwards which show Lucious standing over a casket — but not who is inside. Showrunner Brett Mahoney told EW the death would be an “impactful” one.

Maybe TV fan speculation got conflated with actual reporting of the facts?

We’ll be closely following any updates from the Smollett case to keep you informed.

Two Nigerian brothers identified as ""persons of interest"" in the alleged hate attack on Jussie Smollett could face criminal charges, according to their lawyer.

It's unclear what the men, identified as Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, could be charged with, however, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News.

""They are baffled about why they are people of interest,"" Ms Schmidt told the network. ""It's an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it's not my guys.""

She said the men, who have not been identified, worked with Smollett on the set of his hit TV show Empire and worked out with him at the gym.

But she insisted her clients had nothing to do with the alleged assault on January 29 in Chicago - in which Smollett claims two men shouted racist and gay slurs at him, punched him, doused him with a ""chemical substance"" that could've been bleach and threw a noose around his neck.

Ms Schmidt said the brothers were just as stunned as everyone else over the 2am beat down.

""This is someone that they know, this is someone that they've worked with,"" she said. ""So they don't want to see somebody go through that.""

Sources told the Chicago affiliates for both ABC and CBS that investigators were looking into whether the men helped Smollett stage the attack because he was being allegedly set to be written off the show.

Chicago Police confirmed to ET on Friday that the two men who have been questioned by police since earlier this week were arrested Wednesday night.

A spokesperson for Chicago Police confirmed to ET that it's the same two individuals who were captured on surveillance video around the same time as the attack on the Empire star occurred in the early morning hours of Jan. 29.

""Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney. While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim [Smollett] is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,"" Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Communications Officer for Chicago Police, told ET earlier on Friday. ""For clarification, the two individuals interviewed are classified as potential suspects. Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.""

Police have yet to release the names of these men or any information on why they were arrested. Stay tuned to ETonline as the story develops...

As previously reported, Smollett told police that he was approached by two men as he was walking around Chicago in the early hours of Jan. 29 who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, and at one point wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance -- now believed to be bleach -- on him.

On Thursday, police questioned Smollett again and raided the home of the two aforementioned men. According to reporter Charlie De Mar, who took to Twitter to share the report, the two men were ""of Nigerian decent [sic] and appeared as extras on the show [with Smollett]. Police took bleach, shoes, electronics and more.""

Fox has no comment regarding the arrest of the two men associated with the attack on Smollett. Additionally, Fox cannot confirm the two men were extras on Empire.

Rumors began circulating earlier this week, claiming that Smollett orchestrated his own attack in response to allegedly being written off Empire. However, the network and studio released a statement to ET, denying Smollett's character was being dropped from the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,"" the joint statement read. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

This all comes after Smollett made his first television appearance since the attack, appearing on Good Morning America to recount the incident.

""I heard as I was crossing the intersection, I heard, ‘Empire!’ I don’t answer to Empire,” he recalled. ""My name ain’t Empire. And I didn’t answer. I kept walking and then I heard ‘f****t Empire n****r’ so I turned around and said, ‘The f**k did you just say to me?’”

""It was so fast,” Smollett explained of his delayed reaction to the rope. “It felt like minutes, but it probably was, like, 30 seconds, honestly. I can’t tell you, honestly. I noticed the rope and I started screaming. I said, ‘There’s a f**king rope around my neck.’""

New evidence found during police interrogations cleared them of any connection to the attack. Police is continuing its investigations into the incident.

On Wednesday, Chicago Police arrested two brothers in connection to the attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett last month. Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi announced on Friday that the brothers were ""potential suspects,"" though they haven't been charged with any crimes—and at least one suspect worked on Empire, the Associated Press reports.

The brothers—identified by their attorney as Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, who are of Nigerian descent—were detained at Chicago's O'Hare airport, where they had just gotten off a flight from the country.

As Chicago's ABC 7 reported Thursday, police were looking into the possibility Smollett staged his own attack, but Guglielmi has since said the claim was unfounded. According to him, the detectives on the case have no reason to believe it was a hoax.

Smollett went on Good Morning America Thursday morning, speaking to Robin Roberts about how his side of the story has come into question.

""It feels like if I had said [my attacker] was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now,"" he said in the interview. ""It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth. You don't even want to see the truth.""

In the aftermath of the attack, sources close to Smollett allegedly told TMZ his attackers were white, wore ski-masks, and shouted racial and homophobic slurs as they beat him, poured bleach on him, and tied a rope around his neck. Other reports claimed that he told police his attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country."" But on GMA, Smollett denied some of those rumors, telling Roberts he never told the police the attackers were wearing MAGA hats.

""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.""

As of yet, investigators still haven't said if Smollett knew the two men personally. Earlier, he reportedly told police he believed that the shadowy figures in a surveillance photo of the area were his attackers. And police told ABC they've had their eyes on the two men they arrested for a while now.

Gloria Schmidt, the Osundairo brothers' attorney, has said they're innocent, and insists they're just as broken up about Smollett's attack as others.

“When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified,"" Schmidt told CBS. ""This is someone they know. This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that.""

Smollett has yet to comment on the arrests.
