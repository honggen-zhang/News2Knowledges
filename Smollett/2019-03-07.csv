Cops working the Jussie Smollett case allegedly had seriously loose lips, and now the police force is launching an internal investigation.

Chicago PD tells us its Chief of Detectives opened the investigation out of concerns the force was leaking like a sieve. CPD adds there's been a ton of ""inaccurate"" info in the media, and they want to know who's putting it out there.

A police spokesman tells TMZ ... ""When there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.""

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the police during a CNN appearance saying the leaks were a thinly veiled attempt to skewer the actor."

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers ‚Äì part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest ‚Äì plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years ‚Äì and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd‚Äôs police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, ‚ÄúYou are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that‚Äôs why I stopped the chokehold.‚Äù

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect‚Äôs rights. She apparently jumped on the officer‚Äôs back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

‚ÄúBlack people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,‚Äù Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. ‚ÄúSo, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it‚Äôs like come on.‚Äù

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne‚Äôs been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol‚Äôs Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

‚ÄúIf you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,‚Äù Horne told WBFO. ‚ÄúSo, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.‚Äù

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne‚Äôs case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

The deplorable secretary of HUD Ben Carson warned Lynne Patton, Eric Trump‚Äòs former party planner, to not attend Michael Cohen‚Äòs congressional hearing.

‚ÄúI knew she was going to appear, knew she wanted to do that,‚Äù Carson told Austin Statesman reporter Asher Price. ‚ÄúI left that to her discretion. I mentioned to her a lot of people would have negative things to say about the things she said. I wanted to make sure she understood that.‚Äù

He continued, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really watch it. I was too busy. But I did hear about it.‚Äù

But, of course, Carson still found a way to stand by Trump when asked how he felt that many people said Patton was a prop.

‚ÄúI was much more concerned about the fact someone who has questionable reliability, suddenly has become a beacon of all that‚Äôs true. I just found that kind of a farce, the whole thing,‚Äù he said.

In case you missed it, Cohen said that Trump was ‚Äúa racist.‚Äù Therefore, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows babbled, ‚ÄúLynne Patton says she would not work for a man who is racist‚Ä¶ She disagrees with you. She says as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, that there is no way that she would work for an individual who was a racist.‚Äù Meadows, who somehow seems to believe Patton represents all African-Americans, asked, ‚ÄúHow do you reconcile the two of those?‚Äù

As Patton stood silently behind Meadows, willingly debasing herself even more than she already has as part of the Trump administration, Cohen said, ‚ÄúAsk Ms. Patton how many Black people are executives at the Trump Organization? The answer is zero.‚Äù

During Cohen‚Äôs opening remarks he said about Trump, ‚ÄúHe is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries ‚Äòshitholes.‚Äô In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äòshithole.‚Äô This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States.‚Äù

He continued, ‚ÄúWhile we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only Black people could live that way. And, he told me that Black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.‚Äù

Patton later defended herself on Fox News by saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve said it before, I‚Äôll say it again. The president does not see color, race, creed, religion. What he sees is success and failure. Trump has time and time again done so much for the Black community and I‚Äôm proud to be a part of it.‚Äù

The NAACP is the latest civil rights group to voice concerns.

CNN ACCUSED BY NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS OF LACKING DIVERSITY

‚ÄúIt is vital that news organizations reflect the diversity of our country, which includes people of color in key decisionmaking roles which are responsible for shaping news coverage and providing nuanced perspectives, especially around issues directly impacting Black America,‚Äù the NAACP said in a statement on Thursday. ‚ÄúCNN‚Äôs lack of black representation in leadership roles is troubling and another example of the media industry‚Äôs reluctance to address an issue that continues to plague newsrooms across the country.‚Äù

‚ÄúCNN‚Äôs lack of black representation in leadership roles is troubling and another example of the media industry‚Äôs reluctance to address an issue that continues to plague newsrooms across the country.‚Äù ‚Äî NAACP

Earlier this week, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) elevated CNN to a ‚Äúspecial media monitoring list‚Äù over its diversity concerns and CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker's refusal to even discuss the lack of black executives.

The NABJ specifically expressed concerns ‚Äúabout the lack of black representation within the ranks of CNN‚Äôs executive news managers and direct reports to CNN President Jeff Zucker.‚Äù The group noted that ‚ÄúZucker has no black direct reports‚Äù and that the network doesn‚Äôt have a single black executive producer or vice president on its news side.

‚ÄúThis concern, coupled with Zucker‚Äôs refusal to meet with a four-person NABJ delegation, has prompted NABJ to place CNN on a special media monitoring list,‚Äù NABJ's director of communications, Kanya Stewart, said in a website post.

The NAACP echoed the worries regarding Zucker, putting additional pressure on the high-powered executive.

‚ÄúNAACP finds is offensive that CNN President Jeff Zucker refuses to address this issue. ‚Äî NAACP

‚ÄúNAACP finds it offensive that CNN President Jeff Zucker refuses to address this issue,"" the organization said. ""We are far beyond the point of accepting simple visibility as an instance of true diversity. For major corporations like CNN and its parent company, WarnerMedia, diversifying the media landscape must become a part of a company‚Äôs corporate responsibility rather than always as a response to intolerance and implicit bias.‚Äù

CNN‚ÄôS VAN JONES COMPARES JUSSIE SMOLLETT TO JACKIE ROBINSON: ‚ÄòTHIS IS THE FALL OF AN ICON‚Äô

The NAACP declared that it will stand by NABJ ‚Äúuntil concrete steps are taken by CNN‚Äù to urged parent company WarnerMedia to conduct a diversity and inclusion audit of its news division.

‚ÄúWe will continue to hold the media industry accountable for their insufficient response and actions toward diversity,‚Äù the NAACP statement concluded.

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier in the week, CNN defended its decision not to meet with the group of black journalists, noting that it didn‚Äôt want to work with Roland Martin, who is on a four-person delegation team that has met with other news organizations about diversity. CNN honchos object to Martin‚Äôs role in a 2016 town hall event between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as the impetus to deny the meeting.

Then-CNN contributor Donna Brazile famously leaked a potential question to Clinton ahead of the CNN event, where Martin‚Äôs cable network TV One was a partner.

""For months, we have been working with NABJ to schedule a meeting because the relationship between CNN and NABJ is very important to us. Unfortunately, the significant and reckless damage that Roland Martin did to CNN while partnering with us during a 2016 Democratic Town Hall has made any meeting that includes him untenable. Mr. Martin displayed an unprecedented and egregious lack of journalistic ethics and integrity by leaking questions prior to the town hall,‚Äù a CNN spokesperson said in a statement.

The Hollywood Reporter wrote on Thursday that Martin has said, ‚ÄúWe ain't meeting unless I'm in the room.‚Äù

CNN and Zucker have faced diversity questions before. Back in 2017, a federal judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit against then-parent Time Warner claiming widespread racial discrimination at CNN.

Last year, a study by TheWrap indicated that CNN has ‚Äúsignificantly fewer women serving in visible on-air roles than either Fox News or MSNBC.‚Äù"

CBS Chicago and other media are reporting that ‚Äúdozens‚Äù of workers might have been fired for looking at the records without authorization. So far, the hospital has declined comment, but reports indicate that some of the workers claim they simply scrolled past the records and didn‚Äôt view them.

A Northwestern spokesman, citing privacy rules and company policy, declined comment Thursday.

Federal laws limit who has access to medical records. The privacy rule applies to all forms of individuals‚Äô protected health information, whether electronic, written, or oral. The security rule is a federal law that requires security for health information in electronic form. Successful lawsuits have been filed in many past cases of unauthorized access, with some cases resulting in awards of millions of dollars.

Celebrity medical records are particularly tempting targets. Locally, UCLA Medical Center fired at least 13 employees in 2008 and suspended at least six others for snooping in Britney Spears‚Äôs medical records during her hospitalization in its psychiatric unit.

Smollett was treated on Jan. 29 in the Northwestern emergency room after his alleged attack in downtown Chicago, a confrontation police now claim he staged. He is due back in court later this month to face charges."

‚ÄúCelebrity supersedes criminality,‚Äù Dowd writes, and when Oprah repeats those words before an audience composed primarily of rape and sexual abuse survivors, a hushed ‚Äúooh‚Äù ripples the air in Manhattan‚Äôs Times Center auditorium. Oprah nods knowingly. ‚ÄúMmm-hmm. If you love that line,‚Äù she adds, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll love this one: 'How can you see clearly when you‚Äôre looking into the sun? How can an icon be a con?‚Äô‚Äù

Some may be asking themselves that very same question with regard to R. Kelly, in spite of the pile of testimony against him, much of it provided in the court of public opinion by way of Lifetime's docuseries ""Surviving R. Kelly."" On Wednesday Kelly‚Äôs unhinged explosion during an interview with Gayle King aired on ‚ÄúCBS This Morning,‚Äù revealing a man so out of touch with public perception and so in denial about his alleged behavior that one had to wonder what possessed him to go on national TV in the first place. (Then again, see: Jussie Smollett. Seems that yet-to-be-named ""itis"" going around these days.)

King interviewed Kelly at his home in Chicago‚Äôs Trump Tower ‚Äî where else could he live but Trump Tower? ‚Äî where, at the time, he was free on bond and awaiting trial on 10 charges of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four victims, three of whom were minors at the time they allege that they had sex with him. Hours after the interview first aired Kelly was taken into police custody due to a failure to pay more than $161,000 in child support.

King's cool comportment during the interview has earned her high praise among her peers. As Kelly leaps out of his chair in a rage gesticulating wildly and cursing, King stares straight ahead throughout her subject‚Äôs tirade, unfazed and barely blinking.

Advertisement:

Not once does she raise her voice. ‚ÄúRobert,‚Äù King says evenly as he stabs the air above her with his forefinger, ‚Äúwe have to have a conversation. I don‚Äôt want you just ranting at the camera.‚Äù

Rant he does, to the point that King and the production team pause for a moment while Kelly‚Äôs publicist calms him down. When he finally settles back into his seat, he declares, ‚ÄúI need help.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of help?‚Äù King asks, to which Kelly responds, ‚ÄúThis is the kind of help I need‚Ä¶I need somebody to help me not have a big heart.‚Äù

Advertisement:

This is the stuff that makes late night hosts and the writing staffs of those series, along with ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live,‚Äù sharpen their verbal harpoons. But returning to Dowd‚Äôs quote, the lesson here is not to be blinded by the light but to see, with sharp-edged clarity, what we can learn about our culture‚Äôs relationship with and understanding of abuse.

Winfrey‚Äôs ‚ÄúAfter Neverland‚Äù debuted on HBO and OWN after part two of Dan Reed‚Äôs documentary aired, and her special has been in the works at least since the end of February. There was no way to know back then that Oprah's best friend would air an interview with another famous alleged abuser of minors within a day or two of ""After Neverland""'s debut. But it's a good thing that they are on the airwaves in close proximity: they are coincidental companion pieces, educating the audience about the rolling effects of abuse and the common traits of abusers.

Advertisement:

The crossover is obvious with regard to subject matter, although Oprah cogently opines that the word ""abuse"" lacks accuracy and is confusing. She points out that survivors such as Wade Robson and James Safechuck, the central subjects of ‚ÄúLeaving Neverland,‚Äù didn‚Äôt realize they‚Äôd been abused until much later in life, which is typical of many survivors. Whether Kelly's live-in girlfriends Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage will say the same one day is unknown. On Thursday CBS aired their interview with King, in which they defended the singer and accused their parents of trying to extort the star, with Clary going as far as to claim her parents encouraged her to take sexual videos with him to blackmail him.

Clary's and Savage's parents appear in ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which shows their attempts to extricate their daughters from the singer's orbit. Their families describe them as ""brainwashed."" To King, Kelly claims that Clary and Savage handed their daughters over to them: ""What kind of father, what kind of mother, would sell they daughter to a man? How come it was it OK for me to see them until they wasn't getting no money for it?"" (After Wednesday's interview aired, however, Savage connected with her family in a phone call after having been out of contact since 2017.)

In ""After Neverland,"" Robson uses the term ‚Äútraining‚Äù to describe how Jackson allegedly molded their psyches. From night one, Robson says, Jackson told him he loved him, and what he was doing was an act of love, and that God brought them together. He was around seven years old at the time he alleges the abuse began. Jackson would have been 31. Robson observes that through this and subsequent encounters over the years, he was trained to protect Jackson.

Robson also observes of Jackson, ‚Äúthe grooming had started long before we ever met him, you know? Because he was who he was. He was such a massive figure who represented himself as an angel."" Robson adds, ""long before ever meeting him the first time, so much had been set up already that I was, and I think my mother, my whole family, was already surrendered before I met him.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter Neverland,‚Äù Oprah explains, was conceived of after she saw Dan Reed‚Äôs documentary and realized he demonstrated in four hours what she says she could not do in the 25 years of ‚ÄúThe Oprah Winfrey Show,‚Äù over the course of which she taped 217 episodes on sexual abuse. ‚ÄúI tried and tried and tried to get the message across to people that sexual abuse was not just abuse,‚Äù Oprah explains. ‚ÄúIt was also sexual seduction.‚Äù

She goes on to explain that seduction doesn‚Äôt merely refer to the victims themselves but, in Jackson‚Äôs case, their families. ‚ÄúThe reason the idea of Michael Jackson or any major person committing sexual abuse against children challenges so many people is because in every family you have to face that some things are not the way they appear to be,‚Äù Oprah observes. ‚ÄúAnd what people have to accept in their own families is that people can do good things, they can be loving and helpful, and also be an abuser and a person who does bad things. Both can be true.‚Äù

Jackson is not family, although to millions of people who have profoundly integrated their love for his music into their lives, he might as well be. The same can be said (albeit on a much smaller scale) of Kelly, whose reputation for seducing underage girls and allegedly keeping women as sex slaves received a deep exploration in ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly.‚Äù

Kelly is known to the mainstream population as the creator of the inspirational single ‚ÄúI Believe I Can Fly,‚Äù but R&B fans also know him as the man behind such sexually suggestive hits as ‚ÄúIgnition‚Äù and ‚ÄúBump n‚Äô Grind.‚Äù Never has Kelly been expressly associated with innocence by a wider audience; in fact, unlike Jackson, I‚Äôd wager that before he was acquitted on child pornography charges in 2008, most pop music consumers didn‚Äôt think much about him at all. Afterward the case became comedic fodder for the likes of Dave Chappelle and the cartoon series ""The Boondocks."" Never mind that the case concerned a film allegedly featuring Kelly having sex with a girl who may have been as young as 13 at the time.

But if we have Kelly on the brain now, it‚Äôs because of the multiple claims of illegality have been dragged into the light so many times over the years that it became impossible for authorities to refrain from taking action. Kelly did not participate in ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly,‚Äù which is just as well. Like ‚ÄúLeaving Neverland,‚Äù that series was a means of giving his victims, including his ex-wife Andrea Kelly, a voice.

King‚Äôs CBS News interview, on the other hand, shows America classic abusive behavior acted out by a star. Kelly claims that the more than 50 people in the Lifetime series, including a former tour manager who confirms he enabled Kelly's controlling behavior, are ""lying on him."" He yells, histrionically weeps and accuses the public and his former spouse of engaging in character assassination. Answering King‚Äôs query about his reputation for preferring young girls, Kelly says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt look at ‚Äòmuch younger than me‚Ä¶I just look at ‚Äòlegal.‚Äô‚Äù

Advertisement:

He speaks to the camera, and to men specifically using ‚Äúguys‚Äù and ‚Äúman‚Äù as he rails at Americans who believe the allegations against him.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs stupid, guys! Is this camera on me?‚Äù he asks King, who replies, somewhat exhaustedly before he takes off, ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs on.‚Äù

‚ÄúUse your common sense!‚Äù Kelly bellows, looking directly into the lens situated behind King. ""Forget the blogs, forget how you feel about me. Hate me if you want to, love me if you want. But just use your common sense.‚Äù

He follows his tearful declaration about having too big of a heart with, ‚ÄúMy heart is so big, people betray me and ‚Äî‚Äù he punches his palm for emphasis ‚Äú‚Äî I keep forgiving them.‚Äù

Advertisement:

‚ÄúYou sound like you‚Äôre playing the victim here,‚Äù King says in response. ‚Äú‚Ä¶When I listen to you, it sounds like you‚Äôre playing the victim card.‚Äù

In summary, Kelly displays classic symptoms of abusers: gaslighting (‚Äúuse your common sense!‚Äù), uncontrollable emotional displays, deflection and claiming victimhood.

A number of people cited also noticed these traits last fall during another significant news event, Brett Kavanaugh's high-strung, tearful response to Christine Blasey Ford‚Äôs testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, answering her detailed account of her claim that he attempted to rape her the 1980s, when they were both in high school, with spite-filled rage and tears at his reputation being forever besmirched.

He was confirmed to the Supreme Court nevertheless, because those inclined to believe Kavanaugh (i.e. those with a vested interest in what he can do to support their political position) framed his aggressive behavior as passionate defense and a natural result of frustration.

Advertisement:

Kelly's sphere of influence is minuscule in comparison, although he was once reportedly well-connected in the music community and, according to the docuseries about him, within local police departments. That level of pull doesn't come close to the power afforded to a well-connected white Yale graduate who has steadily ascended in national politics. At any rate, even that appears to be amply diminished.

But people who have some experience with abuse and abusers of any strain, whether physical, verbal, psychological, sexual ‚Äî each adopts plays from the same book ‚Äî may have recognized a few classic tactics in Kelly's eruptive display.

Wouldn‚Äôt it be interesting for CBS to call this out during the prime-time special devoted to Kelly‚Äôs case , scheduled to air Friday at 8 p.m. on the network? According to a CBS's release about the special, it will include as-yet un-aired portions of King‚Äôs 80-minute interview with Kelly, adding ""CBS News journalists will explore the allegations of abuse against Kelly, his denials and more."" It could provide one of those teachable moments that Oprah strives to pass along.

Alas, there remains that matter of the blinding sun. Many are still dazzled by Kelly despite the legal weight pressing down on him. The reason King was able to interview Kelly in his home this week is because on Monday a 47-year-old woman posted the $100,0000 bond for the 52-year-old singer, identifying herself on the record as ‚Äúa friend.‚Äù

The meme-ability of Kelly‚Äôs eruption has already taken hold of social media, inevitably lampooning his showing-out for its entertainment value as opposed to examining it as a symptom of what Oprah refers to in ‚ÄúAfter Neverland‚Äù as ‚Äúthis insidious pattern that‚Äôs happening in our culture that we refuse to look at.‚Äù Millions are bound to be drawn to CBS' coverage of Kelly's evolving reckoning.

Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ""destroying"" his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, a day after the R&B star was jailed for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is charged with sexually abusing three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ""CBS This Morning."" He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse, and his voice broke as he asked, ""How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can't work?""

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ""zero"" relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, he ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a ""sex cult.""

Experts said Kelly's appearance was risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That's why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

""In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,"" said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ""I would document every word they said ... (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.""

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ""historically it's a bad idea,"" Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly's case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

""A lot of the public already thinks he's guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,"" Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ""this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary"" to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locks himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding that the star ""may not know all the evidence against him.""

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she's 14. And police in Detroit were looking into a woman's claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ""knowingly"" have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äî but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ""stick to a script.""

""If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,"" he said.

On Wednesday's broadcast, Kelly's emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ""big heart"" who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ""I didn't do this stuff! This is not me!"" He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ""I'm fighting for my (expletive) life.""

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ""not about music.""

""I'm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can't do it"" because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ""You all just don't want to believe it.""

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ""expecting to leave. He didn't come here to go to jail,"" said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly's finances were ""a mess.""

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äî Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äî also are set to air. Savage's parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying on Wednesday that Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day.

Smollett says that he was attacked last month by two men who were shouting racist and homophobic slurs at him. He claims that the attackers put a rope around his neck and poured some sort of chemical, which smelled like bleach, on him. The actor was subsequently taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital on January 29, where he was treated for his injuries. Sources say that multiple workers were abruptly terminated for accessing the records related to his treatment.

One nurse told the station that she had, in fact, scrolled past the Empire actor‚Äôs chart while trying to access another individual‚Äôs information. That nurse says that she was fired at the end of her shift last week without the chance to explain the situation. She is going to appeal the decision and says that several other workers were similarly fired.

A hospital administrator told The Chicago Sun-Times that she was also fired. She said that a co-worker had asked her if Smollett had checked into the hospital under an alias and she looked the information up, assuming it was a professional request. She was later fired and was told that she had inappropriately accessed the actor‚Äôs files, which is a violation of the hospital‚Äôs policy.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get any information about [Smollett]. I never clicked on his name and entered his record,‚Äù she said.

A few weeks later, she was pulled into a meeting with human resources and her boss to discuss the situation.

‚ÄúThey called it a ‚Äòhuge breach,‚Äô and I said, ‚ÄòIf that‚Äôs the case, don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs a training issue?'‚Äù she told the Sun-Times.

Then, at the end of last month, she attended another meeting where she was let go from her position.

‚ÄúThey again said I accessed [Smollett‚Äôs] record, and I said I didn‚Äôt access his record,‚Äù she said.

The administrator said that she didn‚Äôt know how many people had been fired in the situation, but that the night of Smollett‚Äôs arrival was a big deal and the event was all over the news that evening.

Smollett is accused of faking the attack because he was unhappy with his salary on the show. He allegedly paid two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, who worked with him on the show to stage the event. He has been charged with felony disorderly conduct and for filing a false police report."

The Empire actor was treated at the medical facility after allegedly being attacked by two men in January.

The employees reportedly gained access to Smollett's medical chart after he had been accused of staging the attack. One of the nurses who was terminated claimed the entire incident was a misunderstanding and simply glanced at the record while looking for another patient's information. Nevertheless, she was fired last week for allegedly viewing the actor's charts. She is appealing the termination and says many other hospital workers may have been let go for the same reason.

On Jan. 29, Smollett was rushed to Northwestern after he had been allegedly attacked and put in a noose by two unknown men screaming racial and homophobic slurs at him. Many fans and celebrities took to social media to condemn the hate crime, and display their support for the Empire actor. However, following an investigation conducted by Chicago police, Smollett was charged for allegedly orchestrating the stunt and hiring the men to stage an attack.

Many reports have attempted to pinpoint why Smollett would attempt to pull off such a hoax, suggesting it may have been an effort to secure more pay on the Fox series, or simply to garner more publicity. Empire producers have stated they don't believe Smollett's alleged plot had to do with his compensation, as he never indicated he was dissatisfied by his rate.

But according to Chicago police, there's ""a lot more evidence"" that has yet to be shared with the public, that suggests Smollett staged the assault nearly two months ago. The police Chief did reiterate that Smollett, like any person who has not been tried for a crime, remains under the ""presumption of innocence."" Many celebrities have come to Smollett's defense, despite the mounting evidence against him, including Queen Latifah and Empire co-star Terrence Howard."

‚ÄúI was glad that he didn‚Äôt because as you see there‚Äôs much more to the conversation and he doesn‚Äôt stay an angry man the whole time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMost of the time he is very calm, he‚Äôs very levelheaded.

Fox News mixing up Black people is normal for the conservative network. Back when the Queen of Soul died on August 16, 2018, every network on the planet was covering her death, but Fox News posted a photo of Patti LaBelle instead. See the photo below with Patti LaBelle in the corner:

‚ÄúWe sincerely apologize to Aretha Franklin‚Äôs family and friends,‚Äù a statement said. ‚ÄúOur intention was to honor the icon using a secondary image of her performing with Patti LaBelle in the full screen graphic, but the image of Ms. Franklin was obscured in that process, which we deeply regret.‚Äù

One nurse from Northwestern Memorial Hospital told CBS Chicago that they and others were fired by bosses for looking at Smollett's medical records after he was treated in the emergency room on January 29.

The nurse did not give their name but said in their case, they were merely scrolling past Smollett's record to get to another patient's file.

Dozens of employees from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago have been fired for looking at Jussie Smollett's medical records after he walked into the emergency room (shown) on January 29 claiming to have been assaulted

They said hospital bosses still fired them and that others received similar treatment.

The hospital did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's inquiries on Thursday afternoon.

It remains unclear how many employees were allegedly terminated as a result of the case.

Smollett, who will return to court March 14 to face a felony disorderly conduct charge for allegedly making the entire story up, went to the hospital in the early hours of the morning on January 29 after speaking to police.

He had some scratches and bruising on his face and also claimed to have bruises on his ribs.

Police say that brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo punched him during the allegedly staged attack but that he cut himself on the face to make it look more believable.

The Empire actor vehemently denies staging the attack and maintains he is the victim of a hate crime.

Smollett is shown left in his mugshot and right in the emergency room FaceTiming with Empire creator Lee Daniels on the night of the attack

When they charged him last month, prosecutors and police abhorred Smollett for what they said was a waste of police time and resources.

The Chicago Police Department spent weeks combing through security footage and interviewing witnesses as part of the probe while Smollett performed to sold out audiences and went on Good Morning America.

If he is convicted, he may have to repay some of the money that was spent in the investigation.

His lawyers maintain that he is innocent and that the police department has 'trampled' his presumption of innocence by leaking details of their investigation throughout.

The department's officers and investigators say they treated Smollett as a victim until the two brothers who he identified as his attackers confessed that the entire attack was a hoax.

They said Smollett orchestrated the hoax because he wanted a higher salary."

Kelly‚Äôs attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ‚Äúknowingly‚Äù have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äî but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ‚Äústick to a script.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,‚Äù he said.

On Wednesday‚Äôs broadcast, Kelly‚Äôs emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ‚Äúbig heart‚Äù who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this stuff! This is not me!‚Äù He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my (expletive) life.‚Äù

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly‚Äôs finances were ‚Äúa mess.‚Äù

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äî Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äî also are set to air. Savage‚Äôs parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying on Wednesday that Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day."

However, city officials including Mayor Rahm Emanuel still believe Smollett hired the two men in MAGA hats to put a noose around his neck and attack him. While we may never know exactly what happened that night, the unfortunate reality is that some people are psychologically prone to playing the victim, often as a result of complex childhood trauma that results in insecure attachment and, occasionally, personality disorders.

‚ÄúThis is an extreme case, but if you dig deep enough, you‚Äôre probably going to find some early experiences that informed the way he developed and contributed to what was ultimately pathological,‚Äù Alex Ribbentrop, a therapist and clinical social worker who specializes in treating trauma, told Fatherly.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do things in a vacuum.‚Äù

Developmental psychologists generally agree that our earliest experiences and relationships have a significant and inevitable influence on who we become, across the board. Attachment theory states that when these relationships are unstable and needs are not met, babies and children form insecure attachment styles that can cause them to act out, often for the rest of their lives.

Thanks for the feedback! Oops! Something went wrong. Please contact support@fatherly.com

People with insecure attachment tend to be either anxious or avoidant. Anxious people cling to victim roles because taking responsibility for themselves is too overwhelming, so they play the helpless card. Avoidant people are more antisocial, and usually come off more as perpetrators rather than victims. Although Ribbentrop cannot diagnose Smollett without a proper assessment, he notes that avoidant individuals tend to manipulate scenarios to make themselves look like victims.

In extreme instances of anxious and avoidant attachment, people develop full-blown personality disorders. Personality disorders are diagnosable mental conditions characterized by chronic problems in relationships and daily functioning. People who consistently play the victim display some behaviors consistent with ‚ÄúCluster B‚Äù personality disorders. These include antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and histrionic personality disorder, which are characterized by dramatic, overly emotional, and unpredictable behaviors.

‚ÄúWith trauma, oftentimes you‚Äôre going to see an acute behavior that sticks out where someone is egregiously crossing the line‚Äîpersonality disorders that are correlated with early childhood trauma experiences,‚Äù Ribbentrop says.

It‚Äôs important to note that trauma, attachment, and self-victimization all happen on a spectrum. People who play the victim to the extent of the Smollett allegations are almost always going to display personality disorder characteristics, whether they receive a diagnosis or not. However, a lot of everyday self-victimization doesn‚Äôt involve actors or thousands of dollars. It can as simple as misinterpreting a dirty look.

Whether they have a personality disorder or not, the challenge with people who play the victim is that most people do not see themselves as playing. If Smollett was lying, there‚Äôs a good chance he‚Äôs not going to admit it to himself, let alone other people. For some people who struggle with insecure attachment, it might be enough for a friend or a loved one to point out this victim mentality to get them to see it. But for many people who experience it to an extreme degree, the consequences have to make life untenable to force a change.

In some way, people who play victims legitimately are victims‚Äîof early childhood trauma and personality disorders. They have likely been hurt and need to heal, they‚Äôre just going about it all wrong. It can be challenging to have compassion for people who play the victim, but sometimes compassion is simply a matter of understanding where the awful behavior is coming from and setting boundaries.

‚ÄúThe compassionate thing to do is to allow someone to take responsibility for their actions so they can learn and grow from them, but it needs to come from a place of understanding,‚Äù Ribbentrop says.

‚ÄúSometimes compassion is a hug. Sometimes, it‚Äôs a kick in the butt.‚Äù"

Kelly arrives at the Daley Center for a hearing in his child support case at the Daley Center in Chicago, on March 6, 2019. (Ashlee Rezin/Chicago Sun-Times via AP)

R. Kelly Says Ex-wife Destroyed His Name, Others Stole Money

CHICAGO‚ÄîR. Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, March 7, a day after the R&B star was jailed for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is charged with sexually abusing three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ‚ÄúCBS This Morning.‚Äù He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse, and his voice broke as he asked, ‚ÄúHow can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can‚Äôt work?‚Äù

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ‚Äúzero‚Äù relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, he ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly,‚Äù which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a ‚Äúsex cult.‚Äù

Experts said Kelly‚Äôs appearance was risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That‚Äôs why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

‚ÄúIn my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,‚Äù said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ‚ÄúI would document every word they said ‚Ä¶ (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.‚Äù

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ‚Äúhistorically it‚Äôs a bad idea,‚Äù Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly‚Äôs case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

‚ÄúA lot of the public already thinks he‚Äôs guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,‚Äù Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ‚Äúthis kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary‚Äù to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locks himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding that the star ‚Äúmay not know all the evidence against him.‚Äù

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she‚Äôs 14. And police in Detroit were looking into a woman‚Äôs claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly‚Äôs attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ‚Äúknowingly‚Äù have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview‚Äîbut only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ‚Äústick to a script.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,‚Äù he said.

On Wednesday‚Äôs broadcast, Kelly‚Äôs emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ‚Äúbig heart‚Äù who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this stuff! This is not me!‚Äù He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my (expletive) life.‚Äù

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly‚Äôs finances were ‚Äúa mess.‚Äù

Dozens of employees at Northwestern Memorial Hospital have reportedly been fired after allegedly improperly reviewing the actor‚Äôs medical records.

Smollett was treated at the hospital on January 29 after he claimed to have been violently attacked by two men outside a Subway restaurant.

CBS Chicago reports:

Sources said those workers have been terminated after gaining access to the ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù actor‚Äôs medical chart. Smollett has since been charged with staging the whole incident. One of the nurses said it was a misunderstanding, and claimed she never even accessed Smollett‚Äôs chart, but she was fired last week and believes many other nurses and staffers were fired for the same reason. The nurse said she was called in at the end of her shift last Tuesday, fired on the spot and escorted out of the hospital.

The nurse went on to say that she was never given a chance to explain herself and insists she never looked at the actor‚Äôs chart, she simply scrolled past his name in the hospital database while searching for another patient‚Äôs records.

She is now appealing her termination.

Honestly, hospital workers absolutely should not have been reviewing Smollett‚Äôs‚Äìor any patient‚Äôs‚Äìcharts without permission. No if‚Äôs, and‚Äôs, or but‚Äôs. There are very clear laws about that sort of thing. (See the HIPPA Privacy Rule.)

At the same time, if Smollett hadn‚Äôt have lied about the attack and checked into the ER for self-inflicted injuries that he could then include in a bogus police report, none of this would have ever happened.

And if the nurse is telling the truth, and she really didn‚Äôt look at his chart, then she‚Äôs yet another innocent bystander in this whole mess.

When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Northwestern Memorial Hospital said it doesn‚Äôt comment on the their workers‚Äô employment statuses.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court March 14. Though he denies any involvement in the attack, producers have cut his role from the remaining episodes of Empire this season.

Kelly's tears,[],https://media.salon.com/2019/03/cry-baby-kelly.jpg,"['abuse', 'tears', 'alleged', 'victims', 'valeria', 'r', 'danger', 'kellys', 'women', 'victim', 'survivors', 'smith', 'smollett', 'kelly']","America has a long history of oppressing women, people of color and the LGBTQ community. Imagine representing all three. For hundreds of years, all of these groups fought, marched, protested, risked their lives and sometimes died to secure their rights, freedoms and the ability to simply be heard. It's still tough; however, something special is happening in this country, and finally we are we are starting to see changes, however small.

Social media movements like #TimesUp, #MeToo and #BLM have been giving victims of oppression spaces to share their stories. We are seeing historic justice being brought against people once thought to be bulletproof like Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer. Talented women like director Ava DuVernay are rising in Hollywood. We're seeing African Americans be nominated and win Oscars more than any time in history, and rusty racist Confederate statues are falling down all over America.

The formulas for these changes are extremely complex and the result of countless hours of organizing. But empowering victims to tell their stories, and harnessing the collective energy they inspire, is a trait each movement shares. The personal story can simplify a complex systemic problem a movement is trying to rectify. The meanest oppressors, racism-deniers and rape apologists buckle at the knees when they can connect with a victim‚Äôs personal story that touches their heart and allows them to see humanity in a person who may not share the same social context. The power of sharing hardships has been the most valuable currency to deposit in the bank of change.

But if you know America, you know all banks eventually get robbed.

Take this case in Baltimore. Valeria Smith is an aspiring rapper. You may not have heard of her yet ‚Äî she only has around 1,700 followers on Instagram where she posts as @shalavou. This young woman‚Äôs world was flipped upside down one night last December. While riding through the city after a birthday celebration with her dad Keith Smith and stepmother Jacquelyn, she and her father say a panhandler approached their car window begging for money to feed her baby. According to her father, Jacquelyn rolled down her window to give some money, and the panhandler stabbed her in the neck and snatched her purse. Jacquelyn died from her wounds.

Keith and Valeria went on a local media tour¬≠ explaining the ills of Baltimore city, demanding justice for Jacqueline and answers for her killing. Keith went as far as advocating to get a bill passed that would ban panhandling, as a way to honor her death. The story of Jacquelyn's murder caught national attention. Oprah even tweeted to her 42 million followers, ‚ÄúThis story struck my heart. I‚Äôve done this a 1k times. But will think twice before ever doing again. To J.S. family I hope her death gets people ‚Äúwoke‚Äù to change!‚Äù

Three months later, however, Baltimore police say that Keith and Valeria lied about how Jacqueline was killed, and arrested the father and daughter duo in Texas just miles from the Mexican border, charging them with Jacqueline Smith's murder.

A story about how a woman's kind heart got her killed flipped in an instant, although the underlying theme ‚Äî manipulating goodwill with evil intent ‚Äî seem as if it still applies.

Keith and Valeria Smith could have won Oscars for their performances as a family of victims who survived the random murder of their loved one. In this clip, Valeria breaks down in grief in front of TV news cameras as she pleads for information about and mourns the unfairness of her stepmother's brutal killing:

There's no word yet on motive, but what makes this story stand out is how willing the duo were to step into the public roles of violent crime victim survivors. They didn't keep their heads low and ask for privacy in this difficult time of grief. They stepped in front of cameras and reaped all the attention that came after.

But we also have people playing up their alleged victim status who don‚Äôt want for fame or money, and that‚Äôs when things really get strange.

The alleged racist and homophobic attack on ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett sent his fans, and the new fans he gained after his report of the attack, in rage. Smollett claimed to have been walking down a Chicago street late at night when two white men attacked him, throwing a noose around his neck and dousing him with bleach. Smollett portrayed himself in follow-up appearances as a tearful victim of a hate crime who bravely fought back, and people cheered him on.

During the investigation, an apparently overwhelming amount of evidence surfaced ‚Äî including text messages from alleged co-conspirators with ""Empire"" affiliations, false time stamps, injuries that didn't match Smollett's statement, and video camera footage ‚Äî which lead the Chicago police department to believe that Smollett orchestrated his own attack, though a definitive motive remains elusive. And though he has been charged and is awaiting his trial, Smollett denies his involvement. If this was a theatrical performance, not a real crime investigation, we would say Smollett has not broken character once.

Then this week, R. Kelly sat down for an interview with CBS anchor Gayle King, breaking his silence since the Lifetime docuseries ""Surviving R. Kelly"" detailed decades of rape and abuse allegations against the once-popular R&B star. Last month Kelly, 52, was charged with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse against four women, three of them underage girls, from 1998 to 2010.

When asked by King about the allegations of abuse his ex-wife Andrea levied in ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" the singer became outraged. He cried. He wailed about the unfairness of the accusations and how they have affected his relationship with his children. ""What kind of woman would tear down a dad who's trying to have a relationship with his kids?"" he pleads, seemingly in anguish.

Kelly has been described as a ""master manipulator."" Kitti Jones told Inside Edition that ‚Äúhe could make you feel like you're wearing red and you're wearing blue.‚Äù Here he appears to be angling for sympathy from viewers, casting himself as the victim of his ex-wife, rather than the alleged perpetrator of decades of abuse against women and girls. Soon after the interview he was arrested again and at press time remains in custody for failure to pay court-ordered child support.

In Kelly's case, there's enough evidence out there, especially after the docuseries release, to cast doubt at the authenticity of his performance. And yet it will work on some, at least for a while. It always does.

The same storytelling strategies that have helped bring about positive change are now being used to manipulate the public for sympathy. When true expressions of grief, anger and fear that survivors display are co-opted in bad faith by people who want the empathy and uplifting attention that survivors now ‚Äî in some cases, finally ‚Äî receive, it makes it that much harder to use individual stories as rallying points for activist causes."

If so, congratulations, you might just be a far-leftist like outspoken Hollywood actor Jussie Smollett or Democrat Mayor, of Lamar, South Carolina, Darnell Byrd-McPherson.

In fairness to volunteer Mayor Byrd-McPherson, at least she was sincere when she dialed up local authorities in early February to report that a bigot had sprayed a ‚Äúyellow, sticky substance‚Äù on her 2017 Symphony Silver Hyundai Elantra Sport and her husband‚Äôs soft-top 1998 Buick Roadmaster.

‚ÄúLamar Mayor Darnell Byrd-McPherson said someone came onto her property Wednesday night and vandalized her cars,‚Äù local station WPDE reported at the time. ‚ÄúByrd-McPherson said the vandalism maybe [sic] investigated as a hate crime.‚Äù

‚Äú[D]uring the 70s, crosses were burned in the yard of our home when my Mother was involved with the civil rights movement. On this very same corner in this very same front yard!‚Äù she said to the station. ‚ÄúAgain, we are grateful the person or persons did not try to take our lives but the culprits will be identified and prosecuted.‚Äù

And she really believed it too: ‚ÄúI likened it as a hate crime because No. 1, there‚Äôs a history in our town of Lamar,‚Äù she would later say to Newsweek about a month later.

‚ÄúIt ignited some fear in my spirit. My God, who would do that? It was something; it was just unnerving to me,‚Äù she continued, adding that the fact that only their cars had been allegedly targeted in the neighborhood was horrifying: ‚ÄúTo me that was the message.‚Äù

See photos of the allegedly bigoted substance below:

Except the only ‚Äúmessage,‚Äù if you want to even call it that, was that Mother Nature has a wickedly hilarious sense of humor. How so? It turns out the ‚Äúyellow, sticky substance‚Äù was most likely just pollen.

‚ÄúWe found it to be pollen,‚Äù Darlington County Sheriff‚Äôs Office Lieutenant Robby Kilgo confirmed to Newsweek.

It reportedly only took a rudimentary investigation by a sergeant and a deputy for Kilgo‚Äôs team to conclude that the substance ‚Äúhad a yellowish tint to it and that it‚Äôs a type of powder similar to pollen.‚Äù

Whoops.

In fairness to McPherson, she‚Äôd thought so too initially, up until her husband and her neighbors filled her mind with paranoia.

‚ÄúThe incident happened last night. Even though I drove my car today, I thought it was pollen. My husband and our neighbor noticed the cars looked like someone had spray painted on both our vehicles, which were parked in our front yard,‚Äù she said to WPDE at the time of her initial report.

What‚Äôs insane is that now that her husband and her neighbors have convinced her that a hate crime was perpetrated against her, nothing can convince her otherwise.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something,‚Äù she said to Newsweek. ‚ÄúSomething that‚Äôs sticky that‚Äôs stuck to my car and took two different solutions to get it off.‚Äù

But there‚Äôs more. She now believes that someone‚Äôs trying to kill her.

HERE‚ÄôS WHAT YOU‚ÄôRE MISSING ‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a police officer who came to me and said, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs rumors out there that they‚Äôre going to assassinate you,'‚Äù she claimed to Newsweek.

‚ÄúShe had asked the local law enforcement to file a complaint about the purported death threat as well,‚Äù the outlet reported.

Thanks to her complaints, the case was referred to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. However, the statewide investigative law enforcement agency ultimately chose to not launch a probe for obvious reasons ‚Ä¶

Obvious reasons that continue to fly over Byrd-McPherson‚Äôs head, amazingly enough. Regarding her future, she reportedly just wants to come together.

‚ÄúWhat do we need to do in Lamar? I say, we need to come together,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere should be something else‚Ä¶. But there‚Äôs always these remnants of racism,‚Äù she said to Newsweek.

And remnants of delusion too.

A quick glance through Twitter shows that plenty of other people have found their cars covered in pollen:

The difference is that none of these ‚Äúvictims‚Äù cried their hearts out to the police about racism. Why not? Because they haven‚Äôt been indoctrinated by the Democrat Party into believing they‚Äôre victims.

Think of all we‚Äôve witnessed in the past few weeks alone, examples ranging from the outrageous to the ridiculous.

Jussie Smollett. Jeff Bezos. Patriots owner Robert Kraft. ‚ÄúKayak killer‚Äù Angelika Graswald, convicted of letting her fianc√© drown in the Hudson River, posing for Elle magazine underwater in her own bathtub. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret what happened,‚Äù she said.

Former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson, called out for plagiarizing at least six passages in her book about the state of journalism ‚Äî which she denied before admitting to making ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù that nonetheless should not ‚Äúovershadow what I think is a really interesting book.‚Äù

Michael Cohen sitting before Congress and testifying, minus any real emotion, that he is a liar, a fraud and a craven opportunist. The Jackson estate suing HBO rather than offering recompense, let alone apologies. The president cursing during a speech at CPAC. ‚ÄúThe Bachelor‚Äù‚Äôs entire season hanging on whether a 27-year-old virgin will actually have sex with at least one of his finalists!

As a culture, we seem to have divested ourselves of shame ‚Äî real shame, not the cheap and easy kind so easily doled out online, where anyone accused of ‚Äúage-shaming‚Äù or ‚Äúbody-shaming‚Äù is expected to express, well, shame. Otherwise, there is never any reason to apologize, to admit full-on wrongdoing, let alone express deep, palpable shame over one‚Äôs behavior.

We‚Äôve seen it in the stance of so many #MeToo monsters, who appear not just defiant but confused as to why they are castoffs, pariahs, or facing criminal court. R. Kelly just gave a truly unbelievable interview to Gayle King in which he insisted that the numerous women who have accused him of statutory rape, abuse and of holding them hostage are all lying. It is he, said Kelly, who is the real victim here ‚Äî while jumping out of his seat and erupting in front of King. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my f‚Äìking life!‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúAre you all trying to kill me?‚Äù

Anti-Semite Mel Gibson still makes movies. Congenital liar Brian Williams still anchors a nightly newscast. The governor of Virginia is still in office after a racist picture from his medical school yearbook appeared. The lieutenant governor of Virginia is still in office after being accused of sexual assault.

It‚Äôs impossible to overstate what we‚Äôre losing. Shame is crucial in well-functioning societies. It‚Äôs an evolutionary adaptation that keeps us cooperating, considerate, and safe. There‚Äôs a reason one of the most memorable scenes in all of ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù was Cersei‚Äôs naked walk through the town square, pelted with food and human waste, to a group chanting one word: ‚ÄúShame!‚Äù

We were once sophisticated enough to fake it if we didn‚Äôt feel it.

No more.

The last great public expression of shame, I think, was in 1995, when actor Hugh Grant went on ‚ÄúThe Tonight Show‚Äù to express his deep mortification for, of all things, getting caught with a hooker. It seems such a quaint offense in our era of real sex scandals, ones that now include assault, rape, human trafficking rings and pedophilia ‚Äî yet such was the threat to Grant‚Äôs rising career that he had to ask the American public for forgiveness.

‚ÄúShowing the embarrassed face that everyone wanted to see,‚Äù as the Los Angeles Times put it.

Why apologize when someone else will surely come along, doing or saying something even more egregious?

Not long after came the erosion, in politics and pop culture: Al Sharpton in a position of influence. Pam Anderson and Tommy Lee‚Äôs sex tape in 1998. Bill Clinton wagging his finger and telling the American people, regarding intern Monica Lewinsky, ‚ÄúI did not have sex with that woman.‚Äù OJ Simpson‚Äôs book called ‚ÄúIf I Did It‚Äù in 2007.

And all of this unfolding in a reality TV landscape with cameras in bedrooms and boardrooms, resulting in a culture less about apology and remorse than ‚Äúowning it‚Äù ‚Äî bad behavior excusable or outright acceptable so long as one doubles down.

In 2016, it was conventional wisdom, in media and political circles, that Donald Trump was completely unelectable after he said John McCain wasn‚Äôt a war hero because ‚ÄúI like people that weren‚Äôt captured.‚Äù After the ‚ÄúAccess Hollywood‚Äù ‚ÄúGrab them by the pussy‚Äù tape was released, to no apology of any kind by Trump and no real consequence, shame became irrelevant.

Yet here we are, ironically living in a perpetual outrage cycle that moves so fast, we forget yesterday‚Äôs controversy today, because a new one has supplanted it. Why apologize when someone else will surely come along, doing or saying something even more egregious? The danger is, of course, that apologies become seen as weak, remorse so rare that we barely recognize it.

And that would truly be a shame."

John Lewis

Yahoo News

A Pennsylvania billboard has sparked an outcry and accusations of racism ‚Äî but the man who put it up insists that he‚Äôs simply trying to strike up a ‚Äúconversation‚Äù about race.

As Pittsburgh‚Äôs WPXI reports, the controversial digital billboard stands on Route 422 outside Worthington, Pa. Its changing screen features multiple messages. One reads ‚Äúwhites have rights,‚Äù while another features a photo of actor Jussie Smollett, who is being investigated for an alleged hate crime hoax.

‚ÄúJussie Smollett hangs himself! Sets ‚Äòrace‚Äô relations back 100 years,‚Äù it reads.

A third message features images of various politicians ‚Äî including Rep. John Lewis and Rep. Maxine Waters ‚Äî and accuses them of being ‚Äúblack racists.‚Äù

John Placek, who owns the billboard, denied any racist intentions.

‚ÄúRacism is misunderstood in America and I want to have the conversation,‚Äù he told WPXI. ‚ÄúWe need to get over: I‚Äôm black. You‚Äôre white. You‚Äôre Hispanic. Who cares? I don‚Äôt care about that. I do care about how you act and how you stand for my flag, our flag.

‚ÄúWe gotta get people talking,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe gotta get them excited. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done. The board was never meant to hurt anybody. I would never do that. I‚Äôm a patriot. I‚Äôm an American. Period.‚Äù

But critics say his messages are inflammatory.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it as thought-provoking,‚Äù Michael Allshouse, who called the billboard ‚Äúracist,‚Äù told WPXI. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it as instigating thoughtful discussion as much as it is provoking and agitating.‚Äù

Many took to Twitter to slam Placek‚Äôs attack on Lewis, who is a civil rights hero.

One problem with real racists is that they don't actually know what racism is. They think it's simple bigotry but it's much deeper. It's systemic.

A new digital billboard in Pittsburgh has folks talking for all the wrong reasons, and many are now speaking out against the ad‚Äôs ‚Äúdivisive‚Äù message.

‚ÄúFirst time I saw it was just complete and utter shock,‚Äù resident Michael Allhouse told station WXPI of the billboard on Route 422 near Worthington, which features images of prominent Black members of Congress, including Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), and dubs them ‚ÄúBlack racists.‚Äù

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J) also appeared on the billboard.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it as thought-provoking,‚Äù Allhouse continued. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it as instigating thoughtful discussion as much as it is provoking and agitating. I do view it as racist.‚Äù

The billboard, purchased by local man John Placek, also features messages that dissolve from ‚Äúwhites have rights‚Äù to one about embattled actor Jussie Smollett, who‚Äôs accused of staging a racist and homophobic attack against himself.

Placek told WXPI he isn‚Äôt racist, however, just a ‚Äúproud patriot.‚Äù

‚ÄúRacism is misunderstood in America and I want to have the conversation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to get over: I‚Äôm black. You‚Äôre white. You‚Äôre Hispanic. Who cares? I don‚Äôt care about that. I do care about how you act and how you stand for my flag, our flag.‚Äù

Despite outrage over the board‚Äôs provocative messaging, Placek said his goal was to spark a conversation.

‚ÄúWe gotta get people talking,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe gotta get them excited. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done. The board was never meant to hurt anybody. I would never do that. I‚Äôm a patriot. I‚Äôm an American. Period.‚Äù

That‚Äôs the question many have been asking since a host on the network confused CBS This Morning‚Äòs Gayle King with ABC‚Äôs Good Morning America‚Äòs Robin Roberts.

According to Deadline, during a segment that aired Wednesday on Fox‚Äôs The Five, host Jesse Watters thought he was giving King a compliment for her unflappable composure and professionalism during her now, much publicized R. Kelly interview, which aired Wednesday.

Both women have interviewed newsmakers with King‚Äôs interview and with Roberts‚Äô interview with actor Jussie Smollett before he was arrested on charges of faking a hate crime attack.

During their sit down this week, the 52-year-old singer had a meltdown while King sat in her chair, composed and waiting for him to finish. The internet was quick to turn still shots of the incident into memes, and while Watters attempted to join in on the praise towards the journalist, it became very clear he was out of his element.

‚ÄúHats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco,‚Äù Watters said which instantly set off a chain reaction of awkward responses from his co-hosts.

Watters was corrected in real time by commentator Dana Perino, who jumped in saying, ""That was not Gayle King. Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview."" Watters then apologized multiple times, even holding up a whiteboard later in the broadcast featuring a marker-scribbled apology to both anchors.

As his momentary perceived embarrassment was quickly followed by his and his coworkers' ability to laugh it off, Twitter users were quick to note the underlying racism of the mixup. Jemele Hill of The Atlantic tweeted, ""That awkward moment when you realize all black women anchors don't look alike.""

Others on Twitter turned their attention to the only Black anchor present, Juan Williams, who tried to pivot the conversation elsewhere as Watters began apologizing.

Sources told CBS2 Chicago that dozens of workers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital were abruptly terminated after gaining access to Smollett‚Äôs medical chart following an attack that police now say was staged.

One nurse who was fired told CBS2 that she and others did not access Smollett‚Äôs chart, but scrolled past it while looking for other patients‚Äô names.

She told the station that she was fired at the end of her shift and not given a chance to explain, and that she thinks they were all fired for the same reason. The nurse said she is appealing her termination.

The hospital declined to comment to CBS2, citing company policy that prohibits commenting on employment status. The Hill has also reached out to the hospital.

Smollett checked into the hospital last month, saying he was attacked by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, shouted pro-Trump slogans, tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him.

Chicago police said last month that Smollett paid the two men to stage the assault.

He has since been charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, and faces one to three years in prison. He was released on $100,000 bail and maintains his innocence. He has been cut from the final episodes of this season of ‚ÄúEmpire.‚Äù"

Unfortunately, his story was allegedly fabricated, but its effect on me and on the Black community remains quite real.

This has set a dangerous precedent for the Black community, as Smollett has shown that Blackness can be strategically used for personal gain, rather than community empowerment. If this precedent is indicative of a new trend, the proud legacy of Civil Rights activists could be diminished and dismissed altogether.

Civil Rights pioneers like MLK, Rosa Parks and James Baldwin meant to empower future generations to advocate for ourselves with integrity. But, if Blackness becomes a tool for the opportunistic, the word racism will lose its meaning and consequently, Black activists will lose their influence.

In our current political climate, real hate crimes are on the rise and racial tensions are growing nationwide; the Southern Poverty Law Center tracked 1,020 active domestic hate groups in 2018, part of a growing trend that spiked circa 2016. In our current racial climate, with real hate crimes on the rise, claims like Smollett‚Äôs cheapen the Black experience in a way that we can‚Äôt afford.

One of the most frustrating parts of being Black in the modern world is our inability to effectively call out the racism we experience on a daily basis, as we‚Äôre told that we live in a ‚Äúpost-racial‚Äù world ‚Äî meaning that racism is just a thing of the past.

Those who claim that we live in a ‚Äúpost racial‚Äù world were begging for a scandal like this, and Smollett has effectively proven to them that racism is no longer a problem. Now, they can use his case to claim that Black people have either exaggerated or fabricated our racist encounters just like he allegedly has.

One of the most frustrating parts of being Black in the modern world is our inability to effectively call out the racism we experience on a daily basis, as we‚Äôre told that we live in a ‚Äúpost-racial‚Äù world ‚Äî meaning that racism is just a thing of the past.

In recent years, ‚Äúpolite,‚Äù passive, implicit forms of racism are now accompanied by overt displays of aggression in incidents such as the Charlottesville attacks and a plethora of police brutality cases that would take too long to list.

In light of this, Black people have to effectively call out racism wherever it exists to protect and serve our community, and, more importantly, others have to listen. Unfortunately, events such as these mean that when Black people call out real racism, our voices may fall on deaf ears.

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve wanted to call out the racism in subtle digs like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so articulate,‚Äù which is code for ‚ÄúYou can speak English? But that‚Äôs just for white people! The simulation is glitching.‚Äù Then, of course, there‚Äôs the fetishing nicknames like chocolate and caramel (refer to ‚ÄúFinding Nemo‚Äù: Black people are friends, not food).

I normally bite my tongue when I hear these things because I think these remarks are minute forms of racism, but Smollett‚Äôs precedent threatens to turn all racism into minutiae that could be discounted altogether, just because one boy cried wolf.

In an individual sense, I‚Äôll admit I felt kind of foolish for writing a very personal article about an allegedly fabricated story. As a Black gay man, I identified and sympathized with Smollett, and I rallied behind him when he told fans it was time to be ‚ÄúBlacker and gayer,‚Äù but now that inspiring message has turned into a cheap platitude.

This obviously won‚Äôt change my identity or how I express it, but I won‚Äôt pretend that it hasn‚Äôt injured my pride. Smollett‚Äôs alleged fraud dealt a blow to all those who defended him, and it will take time for both the Black and LGBTQ+ communities to process this damage and repair our public image.

Unfortunately, this news came in the midst of Black History Month, a time to celebrate Black excellence and dignity. This scandal serves as a harrowing reminder that we as Black people are responsible for carrying the African American legacy into the future, and that we must do it with the dignity and integrity that Jussie Smollett clearly lacks.

In the Black community, we have a saying: When we like or support someone they‚Äôre ‚Äúinvited to the cookout.‚Äù So, I have a heartfelt sentiment to offer Smollett: We don‚Äôt want your potato salad with the raisins in it, keep your dry chicken to yourself and don‚Äôt even think about showing up with that unsalted mac and cheese. You‚Äôre no longer invited to the cookout, and your Black card is declined.

Raymond Mathews wants you to remember the history of real Black activists, not opportunists.

Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired today, a day after the R&B star was jailed for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is charged with sexually abusing three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ‚ÄúCBS This Morning.‚Äù He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse, and his voice broke as he asked, ‚ÄúHow can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can‚Äôt work?‚Äù

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ‚Äúzero‚Äù relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, he ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly,‚Äù which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a ‚Äúsex cult.‚Äù

Experts said Kelly‚Äôs appearance was risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That‚Äôs why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

‚ÄúIn my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,‚Äù said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ‚ÄúI would document every word they said ‚Ä¶ (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.‚Äù

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ‚Äúhistorically it‚Äôs a bad idea,‚Äù Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly‚Äôs case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

‚ÄúA lot of the public already thinks he‚Äôs guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,‚Äù Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ‚Äúthis kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary‚Äù to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locks himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding that the star ‚Äúmay not know all the evidence against him.‚Äù

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she‚Äôs 14. And police in Detroit were looking into a woman‚Äôs claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly‚Äôs attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ‚Äúknowingly‚Äù have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available today to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äî but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ‚Äústick to a script.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,‚Äù he said.

On Wednesday‚Äôs broadcast, Kelly‚Äôs emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ‚Äúbig heart‚Äù who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this stuff! This is not me!‚Äù He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my (expletive) life.‚Äù

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly‚Äôs finances were ‚Äúa mess.‚Äù

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äî Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äî also are set to air. Savage‚Äôs parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying on Wednesday that Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day."

By Peter Svab

The man accused of assaulting a conservative activist at the University of California‚ÄìBerkeley has been charged with three felonies and a misdemeanor, according to Alameda Superior Court online records.

Zachary Greenberg, 28, was charged March 5 with assault ‚Äúlikely to produce great bodily injury,‚Äù battery with serious bodily injury, criminal threats, and the misdemeanor‚Äîvandalism with damage of less than $400.

If convicted, the first two felony charges carry sentences of up to four years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000; the third chargecould result in a maximum of one year in prison. The misdemeanor may result in jail time of up to a year and a fine of up to $1,000.

On March 1, campus police booked Greenberg into jail after he was believed to be the man who was caught on camera punching conservative activist Hayden Williams on the university‚Äôs campus on Feb. 19.

Greenberg allegedly hit Williams multiple times, including one punch directly in the face, which was caught on video and widely circulated online.

Greenberg‚Äôs bail was set at $30,000, KTVU‚Äôs Henry Lee reported.

Greenberg wasn‚Äôt in custody as of March 6; his arraignment was scheduled for 9 a.m. that day at the Wiley W. Manuel Courthouse, online records show.

Sucker Punch

The incident happened when Williams was manning a table recruiting for Turning Point USA (TPUSA), a conservative student organization that operates on 1,400 campuses.

Williams told The Epoch Times‚Äô ‚ÄúAmerican Thought Leaders‚Äù show that the display included signs reading, ‚ÄúHate crime hoaxes hurt real victims‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis is MAGA Country‚Äù‚Äîa reference to the case of Jussie Smollett, a TV actor charged with staging a racially motivated attack on himself and framing supporters of President Donald Trump by claiming the attackers referenced Trump‚Äôs campaign slogan ‚ÄúMake America Great Again.‚Äù

At some point, Williams was approached by two men who verbally accosted him. He said he started to record the men with his phone about six to seven seconds into the confrontation.

One of the men, alleged to be Greenberg, knocked the phone from his hand. Williams picked up the phone and continued recording. The man started to shove and drag him. ‚ÄúYou want to hit me? I‚Äôm going to shoot your [expletive],‚Äù he said at one point. Finally, after hurling several more curses and insults, he punched Williams in the face and promptly left, leaving Williams with a badly swollen eye.

Williams is a field representative for the conservative Leadership Institute, a training organization for conservative activists. Neither he nor Greenberg was a student of or is employed at the university, the university said.



Williams Responds

Williams said his approach to the incident, such as recording it, followed some recommendations of the Leadership Institute.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really the only way we can hold these people accountable, is by first and foremost, is documenting these incidents as they happen,‚Äù Williams told Fox News. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs really one thing we teach at Leadership Institute, is just try and record everything, and don‚Äôt retaliate, because the left will use anything they can to try to distort the facts.‚Äù

Williams‚Äôs attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, said she was pleased to see progress in the case, though she pointed to a previous case of 2017, when Eric Clanton, a former community college professor, hit a Trump supporter on the head with a bike lock during a rally at the campus. The Alameda County District Attorney‚Äôs office let Clanton off with three years of probation.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre happy that the authorities seem to be taking this seriously, but we‚Äôll suspend judgment on how seriously until we see the resolution of this case,‚Äù Dhillon said.

She called the attack ‚Äúthe very epitome of fascism, the use of violence to silence your opponents and making people afraid of expressing their views.‚Äù

Trump Responds

During the annual CPAC conference on March 2, Trump brought Williams on stage, saying, ‚Äúhe took a hard punch in the face for all of us.‚Äù

Williams said many students across the country face attacks and intimidation if they express their conservative values or support for the president.

‚ÄúThese students do it because they have a love of our nation and freedom and, frankly, a love for you, Mr. President,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo, if you keep defending us, we‚Äôll keep defending you.‚Äù

Trump recommended that Williams sue Greenberg, the university, ‚Äúand maybe sue the state.‚Äù

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the good news,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to be a very wealthy young man. That‚Äôs OK. Go get them, Hayden!‚Äù

Trump announced, to long and thunderous applause, that he‚Äôll issue ‚Äúan executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech if they want federal research dollars.‚Äù

University Responds

In response to the Feb. 19 incident, university officials repeatedly condemned the attack and pledged commitment to free speech.

‚ÄúWe readily admit that this university ‚Ä¶ is unable to prevent a lone bad actor who was neither employee or student from engaging in reprehensible behavior on a campus spanning 1,200 acres and a population of 50,000 people,‚Äù Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said in a March 2 release.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see a way to do that, but that doesn‚Äôt mean our police force and the administration don‚Äôt awaken every morning trying their best to deter criminal behavior and keep our campus safe.‚Äù

The university was forced to step up its efforts to protect free speech after a national outcry over how it handled disruptions of prominent conservative speakers on campus, including protests and riots by far-left groups that had ramped up since the 2016 elections.

Mogulof said that in 2018, the university spent more than $4 million ‚Äúto ensure that our conservative students could safely and successfully hold events on campus and invite speakers of their choice to these events.‚Äù

Conservative student groups have since hosted a number of speakers on campus, Mogulof said, including TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk, Rick Santorum, Dennis Prager, Heather MacDonald, Candace Owens, Dave Rubin, Steve Simpson, Antonia Okafor, and Allie Stuckey.

‚ÄúNot a single disruption. No opposition. No protest. No [media] coverage,‚Äù he said.

One nurse said she believes the firing was a miscommunication and is appealing the termination.

Sources told CBS 2 that workers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital were fired for gaining access to Smollett's medical chart when he visited the hospital's emergency room after he claimed he was attacked by two men.

The nurse who claimed the situation was a misunderstanding said she never even accessed Smollett's chart, but she was fired last week and believes many other nurses and staffers were fired for the same reason.

She said she was called in at the end of her shift last Tuesday, fired on the spot and escorted out of the hospital without being given the chance to ask questions or offer an explanation. She said she never accessed Smollett's chart, but simply scrolled past it when looking for another patient's name.

She said she believes others may have been fired for scrolling past the name as well.

A spokesperson for Northwestern reportedly told CBS 2 that company police prevents him from commenting on the employment status of any employees.

Smollett arrived at Northwestern on Jan. 29, claiming he was walking home from a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. when two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him. He said they beat him, put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

Smollett has since been charged with filing a false police report after authorities said they believe he orchestrated the incident as a ""publicity stunt"" because he was upset with his Empire salary. He has pleaded not guilty and remains free on bond.

Police said Smollett paid two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, $3,500 by check to stage the attack, including pouring bleach on him and placing a noose around his neck.

Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson told Good Morning America that Smollett ""damaged"" Chicago's reputation with his alleged claims and that he hurt legitimate victims of hate crimes.

""I just want people to understand that's a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department,"" Johnson said.

""I just hope people don't judge other folks that are victims of these types of crimes because this is just one particular incident. That's the damaging part of it,"" he continued. ""You damage the city's reputation. We don't need any help with that; we really don't.""

Following Smollett's arrest, FOX announced that he was cut from the final episodes of Empire's current season."

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly‚Äôs finances were ‚Äúa mess.‚Äù

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äî Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äî also are set to air. Savage‚Äôs parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying on Wednesday that Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day."

Kelly are defending the R&B singer, who faces allegations of sexually assaulting teenage girls.

In a tearful interview broadcast on Thursday, Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage (aged 21 and 23, respectively) accused their own parents of trying to extort money from the performer.

The parents of the two women say their daughters have been brainwashed by 52-year-old Kelly.

""I'm crying because you guys don't know the truth,"" Clary said as she sobbed during the interview with CBS.

Clary called her father ""very manipulative,"" and accused her parents of telling ""lies for money.""

""If you can't see that you're ignorant and you're stupid,"" she said.

Kelly, who was in the room during the women's interview, pleaded not guilty last month to charges that he sexually assaulted three teenage girls and a fourth woman. He has denied similar abuse allegations for decades. He was tried on child pornography charges in 2008 and found not guilty.

The new charges were brought after a Lifetime television documentary series featured interviews with seven women, including his ex-wife, Andrea Kelly, who accused him of emotional and sexual abuse.

Clary said her parents encouraged her to make ""sexual videos"" with Kelly when she was 17 so they could blackmail him. She also said her parents had threatened to leak naked photos of her unless Kelly sent them tens of thousands of dollars.

Both sets of parents have denied ever asking for money or receiving money from Kelly.

""We never 'sold' our daughter to him or anyone else ... All of the victims and parents cannot be lying,"" Alice and Angelo Clary said in a statement on Wednesday.

A lawyer representing Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage also said the couple has never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple also said they have not spoken to their daughter for two years.

""At no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,"" attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly was arrested in Chicago on Wednesday for owing more than $161,000 US in child support to his three children with Kelly. He must pay the full amount to get out of jail, a spokesman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said.

In an interview with Gayle King of CBS This Morning, Kelly said he has been in financial difficulties because ""so many people"" who had access to his bank account have stolen from him.

""How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can't work? How can I get paid?"" he said, crying and at times appearing to become hysterical during the interview.

Andrea Kelly's attorney declined to comment on the allegation.

The singer's next child support hearing is set for March 13 and his next court date on the sex abuse charges is scheduled for March 22.

Interviews often 'a bad idea,' say experts

The CBS interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, Kelly whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will ‚Äî likely hoping the raw interview would help sway public opinion.

Experts said Kelly's appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That's why most defence attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

""In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defence,"" said Illinois Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor.

""I would document every word they said ... [and] I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.""

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ""historically it's a bad idea,"" Birkett said.

In Kelly's case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, Calif., attorney and former prosecutor.

If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview. - Fred Thiagarajah , former prosecutor

""A lot of the public already thinks he's guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,"" Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ""this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary"" to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defence, Thiagarajah said, adding: ""He may not know all the evidence against him.""

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she's 14.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ""knowingly"" have sex with underage girls.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äî but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ""stick to a script.""

""If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,"" he said.

On Wednesday's broadcast, Kelly's emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ""big heart"" who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ""I didn't do this stuff! This is not me!"" He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ""I'm fighting for my f--king life.""

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ""not about music.""

""I'm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can't do it"" because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ""You all just don't want to believe it.""

Rising from poverty on Chicago's South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, 12 Play, which produced such popular sex-themed songs as Your Body's Callin' and Bump N' Grind. He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including C√©line Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is I Believe I Can Fly."

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ‚Äúhistorically it‚Äôs a bad idea,‚Äù Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC‚Äôs Good Morning America identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly‚Äôs case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor. ‚ÄúA lot of the public already thinks he‚Äôs guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,‚Äù Thiagarajah said.

Now, it appears that some employees at the Chicago area hospital where he was admitted the night of the alleged hate crime may have let their curiosity get the best of them.

According to CBS Chicago, sources say dozens of workers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital have been terminated for ‚Äúimproperly reviewing the medical records‚Äù of the Empire actor, just so they could sneak a peak at his medical chart.

One nurse, who preferred to remain unnamed, claims it was a misunderstanding, and denies ever accessing Smollett‚Äôs chart. However, she did concede that she and many other nurses and hospital employees were fired last week due to allegations of misconduct concerning Smollett‚Äôs confidential information.

The nurse claims she that at the end of her shift last Tuesday, she was called in by her employers and unceremoniously terminated on the spot, then escorted out of the building, without ever being provided an opportunity to defend herself.

She maintains that she never accessed the actor‚Äôs chart directly, but did innocently scroll past his name while looking for another patient‚Äôs name. She‚Äôs appealing her dismissal and is speaking out because she fears others may have been overzealously fired over the same misunderstanding.

When the station contacted hospital officials for comment on the multiple terminations, a spokesman said company policy prevents him from commenting on the employment status of any of their employees.

Smollett was admitted to Northwestern on Jan. 29, and at the time claimed he was attacked by two assailants who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him. He has since been charged with staging the whole incident in what police believe was a ‚Äúpublicity stunt‚Äù to get a higher salary from for his role on the FOX Network show.

The actor continues to maintain that he is innocent.

Prosecutors said Zachary Greenberg is the man seen in the viral video attacking Hayden Williams, the station said.

Williams ‚Äî a field representative for the Leadership Institute, which trains conservative activists ‚Äî was helping conservative student group Turning Point USA recruit members at UC Berkeley on the afternoon of Feb. 19.

Greenberg was arrested last week and is facing charges of assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury, battery with serious bodily injury, criminal threats ‚Äî all felonies ‚Äî as well as misdemeanor vandalism.

Teresa Drenick with the Alameda County District Attorney's office told The College Fix that felony assault ""does carry a maximum penalty of four years in state prison.""

What did Williams' attorney say?



""It's actually sickening to watch it,"" Williams' attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, said of the attack video following Greenberg's hearing. ""It's outrageous that a man who is exercising his rights on the UC campus is assaulted and subject to physical threats.""

Williams received a black eye as a result of the attack and said he suffered from concussion-like symptoms and that his ears were ringing days after the attack.

Greenberg ‚Äî who is not a UC Berkeley student ‚Äî was ordered not to contact Williams, and he isn't allowed within 100 yards of the campus, KGO said.

What did Greenberg's attorney say?



Greenberg's attorney Alanna Coopersmith focused on her client's right to due process, KTVU-TV reporter Henry K. Smith noted.

""Mr. Greenberg is a 28-year-old man, he was using the library at UC Berkeley to study, he has a clean record,"" Coopersmith said following Greenberg's not guilty plea. ""I realize that many people observing this case are interested in constitutional freedom, and I would remind that one important constitutional freedom is the presumption of innocence, due process of law, due process in courtroom, not on social media or the Internet.""

Coopersmith added that Greenberg is a student ""elsewhere"" but did not give specifics.

What's the background?

Williams told Fox News' Sean Hannity that some Berkeley students got angry at Turning Point USA's recruitment table sign that read, ""Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims."" The network added that the group also had a sign that read, ""This is MAGA Country"" ‚Äî a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

The signs also referred to the controversy surrounding ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was arrested last week and accused by Chicago police of staging a fake hate crime against himself ‚Äî at the hands of Trump supporters ‚Äî to advance his career.

Williams told Hannity the man who punched him claimed Williams and Turning Point were promoting violence ‚Äî and then the culprit got violent himself, even threatening to ""shoot"" him, according to the video of the incident.

I‚Äôll probably never forget the time I stood waiting in line for deli meat at my local Pathmark, when a white man entered the line behind me and was asked what he was ordering before I even had the chance to open my mouth.

My mother did this divide and conquer thing at the grocery store. While she was going in and out of every aisle (something my dad still can‚Äôt stand after 35 years of marriage), my sister picked up the items on one end of the store, and I waited at the meat counter, ticket from the red number dispenser in tow, to get the half pound of smoked turkey breast and quarter pound of provolone cheese we ordered every week.

I was probably in my very early teens at the time, but had little consciousness around the ‚Äúall Black people look the same‚Äù rhetoric. When I asked the man tending the deli counter why he skipped me (because even if my Antiguan mother wasn‚Äôt there to witness it, I could not risk her finding out that it happened and I didn‚Äôt say anything), he looked to the woman he had just served and said, ‚ÄúOh I thought you two were together.‚Äù

Huh? I did not enter the line with the woman. I did not speak to her while he filled her order, and nothing about our interaction should have caused him to believe we were together. Well, except for the fact that we were both Black.

It was my entry lesson into this idea that Black people are all related, and that despite our multitude of hues, facial features, hair texture, etc., to some others, we all ‚Äúlook alike.‚Äù

Over the years I‚Äôve experienced it many times. As a Black editor at a practically all-white magazine, I, on a few occasions, was mistaken for ‚Äúthe other‚Äù Black woman who worked in research. As beautiful as she is, we look nothing alike, nor did we have the same function at the organization. Every time it happened I was irritated and perplexed before quickly reminding myself that as a Black person, despite my unique traits, and own set of accomplishments, I will always be just another indistinct Black woman to some.

I imagine that my reaction is not that far off from the way Gayle King and Robin Roberts feel right now.

Yesterday Fox News anchor Jesse Watters congratulated King for her interview with embattled R&B artist R. Kelly. But what started out as a compliment, quickly took a turn south when Watters went on to say that the interview, which aired on CBS Wednesday morning, was redemption from the sit-down she had with Jussie Smollett last month. The problem with that is King didn‚Äôt sit down with Smollett. Roberts did. And though Watters apologized, the dismissal of these women‚Äôs accomplishments still linger.

King and Roberts are on a very short list of Black women journalists on the morning news. Each of them has an extensive resume going back years in the business and both are talented, successful, and hard-working individuals in their own right. To conflate their identities for what seemed to be a punchline, was both problematic and offensive. To make it plain, it is not okay to not know who these women are.

When you look at the media business and news in general, representation is still an overarching issue. Whether it be the imbalance in what is reported or the lack of diversity in the people who report it, we have a long way to go before we reach parity. So when you have Fox News anchors ‚Äî who by the way were also responsible for mixing up Patti LaBelle and Aretha Franklin last year‚Äî accidentally lumping two prominent anchors together, it serves as a sad reminder of how the rest of the world often sees us.

What each of us brings to the table is important, and unique, and beautiful. It should be respected as such."

‚Ä¢ While the House voted to disapprove of President Trump‚Äôs declaration of a border emergency, all but 13 Republicans stuck with the president.

‚Ä¢ Michael Cohen appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee (welcome to the new Democratic House, everyone) to audition to be the new John Dean. Most of his testimony was expected: We have been getting leaks about what Cohen knows for months. Two items stood out. Cohen denied going to Prague, a claim of the Steele dossier that contributed to the launch of the Russian-collusion investigation. And Cohen said he was continuing to cooperate with the Southern District of New York ‚Äî federal prosecutors looking, beyond the Mueller probe, into other areas of possible Trump wrongdoing. If the president has any vulnerability, it could be here. There were also atmospherics. Woodrow Wilson wanted Congress to be like Parliament serving a prime-ministerial president, not a coordinate branch; most House Republicans obliged, tearing at Cohen like a pack of spaniels. And: Trump and Cohen are now blood enemies, but once they were hand and sock puppet. What does that history say?

‚Ä¢ The 2020 Democratic primary may be a marathon, but it has begun with a sprint to the left as the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris work to out-woke one another ‚Äî alighting, for the moment, on reparations for slavery. The candidates who are for reparations have not yet come to any consensus on what they would entail: Cash payments to some or all black families? A general broadening of welfare intervention on the theory that this would disproportionately benefit black families? The divide is ideological: Senator Bernie Sanders is among those leaning toward a focus on ‚Äúinequality,‚Äù whereas the social-justice Left demands a more explicit focus on race. Reparations are a bad idea for many reasons: There isn‚Äôt some undifferentiated fund of Confederate or plantation-derived capital out there, and much of what afflicts black America is not likely to be cured by a transfer payment. But this is not, at the moment, a question about policy; it is about positioning, a cynical attempt to get a leg up in what we might call the Ta-Nehisi Coates primary, i.e., the race to secure support from influential social-justice figures on the left. While the primary candidates are working through reparations, Democrats in the states have settled on abortion radicalism, extending now into infanticide, as their litmus test. Both positions are deeply unpopular. The walk back will be long and arduous.

‚Ä¢ The House Democratic caucus was recently in a flutter about loss of discipline. Democrats backed a bill to expand federal background checks on gun purchases; Republicans pushed an amendment to require that ICE be notified when illegal aliens try to purchase; freshmen Democrats from swing districts voted with the GOP. Speaker Nancy Pelosi read the moderates a lecture: ‚ÄúWe are either a team or we‚Äôre not, and we have to make that decision.‚Äù Socialist poster-girl Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did her one better, threatening, according to her spokesman, that when ‚Äúactivists ask her‚Äù how such an amendment got attached to such a bill, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre going to want a list of names and she‚Äôs going to give it to them.‚Äù Threats are cheap. The test will be: Can Ocasio-Cortez turn her considerable ability to raise money for herself into a machine that can support primary challengers, and incumbent soulmates, in other districts? That, after all, is the source of Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs power. Money talks louder than talk.

Senator Feinstein, who may not in fact be able to bend at the knee, was having nothing of it and scoffed at the little tykes and their self-important antics: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing this for 30 years,‚Äù she told them, which is true. ‚ÄúI know what I‚Äôm doing,‚Äù she added, which is less true. ‚ÄúYou come in here and you say, ‚ÄòIt has to be my way or the highway.‚Äô I don‚Äôt respond to that.‚Äù The only way it could have been better is if she‚Äôd come out for spanking.

‚Ä¢ President Trump ordered that senior adviser Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, be given a top-secret security clearance, over the objections of top administration officials. The FBI vets candidates, and security officials determine whether to grant a clearance. The president, however, is the ultimate authority and has the power to permit access to classified information. Kushner has done a competent job on such weighty responsibilities as Middle East peace negotiations and criminal-justice reform, but he plainly would have been denied a clearance were he not the president‚Äôs relative. In his vetting process, it emerged that he had potentially problematic foreign associations and heavy business debt; worse, he failed to disclose meetings with Kremlin operatives ‚Äî one during the campaign, with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower (implicated in the Trump-Russia investigation), and another with the Russian ambassador and the head of a Kremlin-tied bank. The administration will take a modest political hit over this, and deserves to.

‚Ä¢ Senate Democrats have defeated the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide standard medical care to infants born alive in the course of attempted abortions. Forty-four senators voted no ‚Äî every Democrat aside from Bob Casey Jr. (Pa.), Doug Jones (Ala.), and Joe Manchin (W. Va.) ‚Äî preventing it from reaching the necessary 60-vote threshold. Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.), the bill‚Äôs sponsor, brought the legislation to the floor in response to Virginia governor Ralph Northam‚Äôs implied endorsement of letting some infants die. Democrats claimed the legislation is anti-abortion and redundant given existing law, but in fact it places no limits on abortion and no comparable federal law exists. Senate Democrats revealed that their dedication to abortion rights is so strong that they are willing to tacitly endorse infanticide.

‚Ä¢ The Trump administration has finalized a new rule that will result in the largest drop in federal funding for Planned Parenthood since the group first began receiving government subsidies nearly five decades ago. The rule forbids the use of Title X family-planning funds ‚Äúto perform, promote, refer for, or support abortion as a method of family planning.‚Äù Planned Parenthood and its defenders claim that the policy will remove necessary health care from millions of American women. In reality, family-planning funds won‚Äôt be reduced at all, merely redirected from groups that commit abortions. The statute governing the Title X program has always declared that ‚Äúnone of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning,‚Äù but that language has been effectively ignored for much of the program‚Äôs history. This welcome change ensures that it no longer will be.

‚Ä¢ At present, all commercial firearm sales involve an instant background check to establish whether the purchaser is prohibited from owning a gun. If the purchaser passes the check, the sale proceeds. If he fails, the sale is halted. If the check comes back incomplete, the government has three days to complete it or the sale goes ahead. This system is not without its problems, but its existence can be justified on the grounds that almost all commercial sales involve interstate commerce at some point, and that, thanks to the maximum three-day window, it is a highly limited imposition on a core right. The Democrats have passed two bills through the House that are far less justifiable. The purpose of their first bill is to extend federal oversight to firearms transactions performed solely within a state, even when the transfer involves no commercial activity. This violates the enumerated-powers doctrine in service of limiting an enumerated right. The purpose of the second bill is to extend the time during which government incompetence can deny a person access to firearms, which, were the first bill to be enacted, could be obtained by no other means. A series of studies has shown that extending background checks to private sales has no effect at all on crime. These bills will languish in the Senate, as they should.

‚Ä¢ Everyone was wrong about the individual mandate, from the Democrats who crafted Obamacare to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which credited the mandate with keeping 14 million Americans insured. Now the mandate is gone, and the consequences are expected to be minimal: A new report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services puts the coverage ‚Äúloss‚Äù at just 2.5 million. The original fear was that healthy people would leave the individual market without a mandate because they could sign up later if they got sick. This would raise premiums for everyone else, leading even more healthy people to leave and beginning a ‚Äúdeath spiral.‚Äù Now it turns out that most Obamacare enrollees have little reason to abandon the exchanges ‚Äî they are heavily subsidized, and the subsidies rise whenever premiums do. The CBO‚Äôs mistake hurt Republicans in their quest to replace Obamacare, as the agency claimed that killing the mandate would increase the number of uninsured dramatically; it also helped Republicans‚Äô tax-reform efforts, because the CBO predicted large savings from repealing the mandate (i.e., enrollees would leave and give up their subsidies). Two wrongs, however, don‚Äôt put the agency anywhere close to being right.

‚Ä¢ Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat and presidential candidate, was among those who greeted the news that the average tax refund this year was smaller than it was last year by lambasting the Republican tax cut as a fraud on the middle class. As we noted in a previous issue, this criticism was absurd. If refunds shrank, it was because tax withholding got more accurate rather than because tax levels rose. Evaluations from across the political spectrum agree that more than 90 percent of tax filers received a net cut. Besides, the complaint was made early in tax season. Data from later on now suggest that the average refund is slightly higher than last year‚Äôs. The news came out the same day that the Democrats running the House Ways and Means Committee repeated the attack. Refunds aren‚Äôt vanishing, but this argument against the tax cut is.

‚Ä¢ Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell, on Capitol Hill, was asked his thoughts about ‚Äúmodern monetary theory,‚Äù a recent fad on the left. He replied with some exasperation about how hard it is to pin down its adherents, who respond to every criticism by saying that their theory has been misunderstood. The theory starts with an accurate claim ‚Äî that governments can borrow more if their debts are in a currency they themselves issue ‚Äî and takes it to imply that governments should rely heavily on debt backstopped by money creation. If inflation rises too high, the MMTers urge, higher taxes should be used to control it. One flaw in this theory is that it depends on politicians‚Äô responding to voters angry about inflation by raising their taxes. A second is that politicians have occasionally tried this gambit (check out the latter days of Lyndon Johnson‚Äôs presidency) and failed. Powell‚Äôs criticism of MMT slipperiness has also been expressed in recent days by Paul Krugman. Which makes it close to unanimous.

‚Ä¢ We recently praised a proposal in the Oregon state legislature to relax zoning regulations, but now the state is headed in a worse, albeit more familiar, direction. Governor Kate Brown signed into law a statewide rent-control bill that caps annual rent increases at 7 percent (plus inflation) and limits landlords‚Äô ability to evict their tenants. Both basic theory and decades of practice tell us that rent control doesn‚Äôt work, but instead discourages the construction of affordable housing and encourages developers to build commercial and luxury properties. This time will be no different, and the eviction restrictions won‚Äôt help. Even if the bill‚Äôs cap on rent is comparatively modest, like all regulations it will likely prove to be the edge of a wedge. Housing is decreasingly affordable, in Oregon as in many states. Rent control is not a solution.

‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù movement has lost one of its leaders. Time‚Äôs Up CEO Lisa Borders resigned after her son was accused of sexual assault. That fact alone would be newsworthy, but what makes this story particularly poignant is that she resigned in part to ‚Äúproactively defend‚Äù her son. Commenting on her resignation, the Time‚Äôs Up board noted that it ‚Äúunequivocally supports‚Äù survivors. As Borders has now learned, it‚Äôs easy to Believe Women until someone you love faces an accusation. Then, the due process you once scorned becomes a lifeline: the only thing standing between your son and the punitive action that could well ruin his life.

‚Ä¢ Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, was charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution after being caught in a police sting of Orchids of Asia, a strip-mall spa in Jupiter, Fla. The massage-parlor racket lures Asian women to the United States with promises of work, entangles them in debts to lawyers and other ‚Äúhelpers,‚Äù often sequesters their passports, and then sends them forth to service clients. The slice of their earnings they command is tiny; to make any real money they must give sexual favors for tips; shame prevents them from coming forward. A dirty, soul-destroying business.

‚Ä¢ Early in February, Representative Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) explained on Twitter that politicians support Israel because ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about the Benjamins baby.‚Äù A storm of complaint forced her to backtrack. But before the month ended she was at it again, telling a crowd at a left-wing D.C. bookstore that pro-Israel Americans think ‚Äúit is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country.‚Äù This brought a blast from Representative Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) who called her remarks ‚Äúoutrageous and deeply hurtful.‚Äù Such attacks, he added, ‚Äúhave no place in the Foreign Affairs Committee.‚Äù Omar sits on it, Engel chairs it. What will the Democratic leadership do? Try to muffle the controversy as long as possible, by passing a resolution condemning such prejudice, without naming Omar and without reassigning her. The lady from Minnesota seems determined to make that as difficult as possible, however. See Proverbs 26:11.

‚Ä¢ A sincere apology is not very common in public life, and maybe not all that common in private life either. Madeleine Albright, a secretary of state under President Clinton, gave one. She was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, and one of the subjects was Russia. In the 2012 general election, President Obama mocked the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, for his concerns about Russia. Albright chimed in with her own criticism. But, in front of the intelligence committee, she said, ‚ÄúI personally owe an apology to now-Senator Romney.‚Äù Why? ‚ÄúI think that we underestimated what was going on in Russia. I was on the CIA external advisory board. There was no question that less money was being put into Russian language and what was going on in Russia.‚Äù Some people have a tendency to forget, said Albright, that a KGB man runs the Kremlin. And he ‚Äúhas played a weak hand very well.‚Äù He has put Russia ‚Äúback on the scene.‚Äù Albright‚Äôs is a reset we can support.

‚Ä¢ The standoff in Venezuela continues, with military and security forces largely remaining loyal to the strongman, Nicol√°s Maduro. Juan Guaid√≥ and the opposition continue to try to tip them. The government succeeded in blocking humanitarian aid to the starving country. Authorities fired buckshot and tear gas at people trying to deliver the aid. That, among other things, revealed the dark heart of this chavista regime. The United States placed sanctions on Venezuelan officials responsible for such actions. That hit them in their pocketbooks, where it hurts. The U.S. also revoked the visas of dozens of others. The wreckers of Venezuelan democracy ‚Äúare not welcome in the United States,‚Äù said Elliott Abrams, the State Department envoy to Venezuela. ‚ÄúNeither are their family members who enjoy a privileged lifestyle at the expense of the liberty and prosperity of millions of Venezuelans.‚Äù People speak of ‚Äúthe right side of history.‚Äù Leaving history out of it, the United States is definitely on the right side.

‚Ä¢ The world has a nervous twitch whenever India and Pakistan reveal their mutual hostility and there is the prospect of a nuclear exchange. Last month, a suicide bomber from Jaish e-Muhammad, one of the most aggressive Islamist groups, killed 42 Indian paramilitary policemen in Pulwama, a town in the part of Kashmir under Indian rule. Reprisal soon followed. The Indian air force attacked the Jaish e-Muhammad encampment, claiming to have killed 300. In a dogfight the next day, Pakistan shot down two Indian MiGs, captured one of the pilots, put him on television, and returned him home. Face saved all around, the world again stopped twitching.

‚Ä¢ For two years the Israeli authorities have been examining charges that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has abused his office. It‚Äôs a witch hunt, Netanyahu maintains; his opponents have tried and failed to vote him out, so they resort to this alternative. Calling for a general election on April 9, he‚Äôd given them one more chance to vote him out. In the runup, however, Avichai Mandelblit, the attorney general, has announced that Netanyahu faces criminal charges of corruption, bribery, and breach of trust, for which he is to be indicted. It is alleged that Netanyahu promoted regulatory changes that benefited a telecom company, in return for which the company‚Äôs news site published items favorable to him; and also that he accepted champagne and cigars to the value of $300,000. The timing of the charges is at best unfortunate, at worst its own abuse. They have wiped out the record of Netanyahu‚Äôs ten-year tenure, and his ratings in the polls have fallen. Whether or not he is found guilty, this is a stricken moment for Israel.

‚Ä¢ Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is in trouble, and that trouble follows a familiar pattern: Young progressive rides into office on a white steed with promises of unprecedented openness and accountability, but quickly gets mired in a predictable scandal involving politically connected business interests, abuse of power, and domestic realpolitik. In Trudeau‚Äôs case, the allegation is that he attempted to bully his justice minister at the time, Jody Wilson-Raybould, into rigging an investigation in favor of Quebec-based SNC-Lavalin, an engineering and construction firm that is accused of bribing Moammar Qaddafi‚Äôs Libya in pursuit of fat infrastructure contracts and then defrauding the same government of hundreds of millions of dollars. A criminal conviction in the matter might have cost tens of thousands of jobs in Canada, and Trudeau and his gang handed down a number of what Wilson-Raybould described as ‚Äúveiled threats‚Äù intended to influence the investigation on SNC‚Äôs behalf. Irrespective of what becomes of the Trudeau government, there is a lesson: What is in theory progressivism in practice is corporatism, an alliance of political and business interests that incentivizes corruption of the kind Trudeau stands accused of.

‚Ä¢ The headline in the (London) Telegraph said a lot: ‚ÄúSaudi crown prince defends China‚Äôs right to put Uighur Muslims in concentration camps.‚Äù Between a million and 2 million of these people have been rounded up. They are subject to torture and murder. The Chinese Communist Party is doing its utmost to wipe out the Uighur language and culture. The Party has turned Xinjiang Province, or East Turkestan, into the most oppressive surveillance region in the world. Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Mohammed bin Salman traveled to Beijing to secure trade deals. Riyadh and Beijing enjoy friendly relations. The Chinese have backed the Saudis 100 percent in their murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist. According to Chinese state media, MBS said this about his fellow Muslims in China: ‚ÄúWe respect and support China‚Äôs rights to take counter-terrorism and de-extremism measures to safeguard national security.‚Äù Xi Jinping could not have said it better. Fred Hiatt, the editorial-page editor of the Washington Post, summed up the crown prince‚Äôs attitude this way: ‚ÄúYou can have your concentration camps. I can have my murder.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Confucius Institutes have always been problematic, when not downright sinister. They are expressions of the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs ‚Äúsoft power.‚Äù The institutes are language-and-culture centers on university campuses throughout the world, and there are almost 100 in the United States. Recent days have seen two reports on Confucius Institutes: one from a Senate subcommittee, one from the Government Accountability Office. Both reports voice well-grounded concerns about the institutes ‚Äî in particular, the CCP influence that comes with them. In 2014, the American Association of University Professors issued a report of its own. AAUP said that universities should either close their Confucius Institutes or renegotiate their agreements with Beijing so as to ensure academic freedom. That makes good sense. Plus, a university can establish its own Chinese program, however humble. Given that the Chinese government is a one-party dictatorship with a gulag and ethnic prison camps, why should an American university be in partnership with it in the first place?

‚Ä¢ The French government has announced a complete ban on cell phones in elementary and intermediate state-run schools, effective next year. The ban will apply not just in classrooms but everywhere; students will not even be able to check their phones between classes or during recess. A parents‚Äô group opposes the ban, while educators seem split: Half fear being turned into gendarmes to enforce the policy while the rest welcome anything that might force the students to focus on their work. Other arguments, pro and con, can be made, mostly depending on circumstance; and that‚Äôs why, instead of issuing edicts from Paris, the best course would be to let local teachers, parents, and residents decide each school‚Äôs policy on their own. But the land that invented laissez-faire rarely practices it.

‚Ä¢ Members of the United Methodist Church, America‚Äôs third-largest Christian denomination, voted in a special conference to reaffirm orthodox Christian teaching against homosexuality. That teaching entails both the decision not to certify ‚Äúself-avowed practicing homosexuals‚Äù for ministry and the understanding that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. The vote for the ‚ÄúTraditional Plan‚Äù on human sexuality was close ‚Äî 53 to 47 percent ‚Äî and angered many within the Methodist fold and in the wider world. Those who adhere to orthodox Christian sexual morality have won a battle in a culture war that they‚Äôre losing, at least here in the West. Their rejection of homosexuality stems from bedrock beliefs about the purpose of sex. To answer the charge of bigotry, they need to situate their beliefs in the context of that larger vision, which is honorable, and to explain it with equal measures of clarity and charity.

‚Ä¢ Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood, transgender students in Connecticut, came first and second in the 55-meter girls‚Äô indoor state track championship this year. Selina Soule, a competitor who was narrowly defeated, pointed out on Fox News that Miller and Yearwood have obvious physiological advantages as biological males. She‚Äôs right. Taller height, greater weight, broader shoulders, stronger grip, bigger lung capacity, more upper-body strength, higher muscle-to-fat ratio, and longer resistance to dehydration are just some of the reasons for the performance gap between men and women in sports. Yet some believe that pointing this out amounts to ‚Äútransphobia.‚Äù Martina Navratilova, nine-time Wimbledon singles champion, found out as much after she wrote in the Sunday Times of London that allowing biological males to compete in women‚Äôs sports based on nothing but their self-reported gender identity was ‚Äúinsane.‚Äù For this she was promptly dropped from the board of a U.S. LGBT sports organization. Thus does women‚Äôs sports disclaim its own history and subvert its own purpose.

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhy would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?‚Äù Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson, himself a black man, asked upon announcing the arrest of Jussie Smollett. Why Smollett would use the symbolism of a noose is obvious: Such shocking, hateful, incendiary details are certain to generate vast quantities of publicity. Smollett, an actor who Johnson said wished to use such exposure to raise his weekly salary for the show Empire (reported by the Associated Press to be more than $100,000), was charged on February 21 with a felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false report after he allegedly paid $3,500 to two brothers to fake a hate-crime attack. The details of that assault looked to neutral observers like low-grade television writing, and the methodical accounts of Chicago reporters who covered the story up close made it clear from the start that there was likely more to things than met the eye. Nevertheless, national activist groups and celebrities rushed to blame the fake attack on the supposedly hateful atmosphere created by President Trump and/or Vice President Pence. If any of these grievance hucksters have apologized for further dividing America, we must have missed it.

‚Ä¢ The big winner at the 91st annual Academy Awards ceremony was Green Book, a soft-hitting, ground-non-breaking buddy comedy about an uneducated white driver overcoming his racial bias in the process of witnessing the racist cloud that trails a gifted black pianist he chauffeurs around the Jim Crow Deep South. Observers who were rooting for an angrier race movie, such as Spike Lee‚Äôs BlacKkKlansman, or a film whose cast is almost entirely black, such as Black Panther, denounced the choice ‚Äî Green Book ‚Äúreeks of bad faith and cluelessly embodies the white-supremacist attitudes it‚Äôs ostensibly decrying,‚Äù wrote Justin Chang in the Los Angeles Times. Lee himself, when the evening‚Äôs last winner was announced, staged an impromptu one-man protest, turning his back on the speech of winning producer Peter Farrelly. Green Book is a trite mediocrity that was anointed solely because the Academy wants to show it stands against racism, but the fracas about its victory demonstrated that, once identity politics rather than quality becomes the chief criterion by which life‚Äôs goodies come to be distributed, the result is not a widely shared feeling of social satisfaction but bitterness and resentment.

‚Ä¢ You know how your spouse is always nagging you to clean the garbage out of the car? Candy wrappers, pencil stubs, packets of tissues with only one left ‚Äî some of history‚Äôs most passionate love affairs have foundered over this issue. But there‚Äôs hope. The next time your beloved renews this complaint, you can remind him or her of the case of Jeremy Taylor, an Oregon man who drove into the wilderness and found himself stranded in deep snow. With his faithful dog, Ally, he stayed in his car for five days, periodically running the engine for warmth (pro tip: always dig out the tailpipe first). Taylor says the only food he had during his ordeal was three packets of Taco Bell ‚Äúfire‚Äù sauce ‚Äî which must have heated him up at least a little and was probably not something the dog was tempted to steal. So don‚Äôt go clearing everything out of that glove compartment just yet: The life you save may be your own.

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWe want to bring a title back to D.C.,‚Äù Bryce Harper, sounding caffeinated, told reporters after the announcement that he was leaving D.C. ‚Äî for Philadelphia, which, after all, some Washingtonians consider a D.C. suburb. The star slugger for the Washington Nationals had just signed a record contract with their rival the Phillies, who are now committed to paying Harper $330 million over the next 13 seasons. Big-sum, long-term contracts usually don‚Äôt work out for the clubs that spring for them. (Ask the New York Mets, who every year until the end of time or 2035, whichever comes first, have to send a check for $1.19 million to Bobby Bonilla, retired from major-league ball since 2001. Better yet, don‚Äôt ask.) Harper, the first-round draft pick in 2010 and the most touted phenom since Sidd Finch, had a great year for the Nationals . . . in 2015. He strikes out a lot, though he walks a lot. He hits a home run every four or five games. A designated hitter at heart, he‚Äôs an outfielder in the National League because it‚Äôs the National League. His contract makes no apparent sense, but good for him. Good luck to the Phils.

NORTH KOREA

No Deal

Donald Trump walked away from talks with North Korea, which was the best possible outcome given that he never should have walked into the talks to begin with.

In the unlikely event that North Korea wanted to give up its nuclear program, it could have demonstrated its commitment over time in low-level talks building toward an agreement. Instead, President Trump took the high-wire route of two direct meetings with Kim Jong-un, giving the North Korean dictator, if nothing else, an incalculable propaganda coup by enhancing his international standing.

Worse, Trump couldn‚Äôt help but make boosterish comments about the Supreme Leader, who enslaves and immiserates his people. In Hanoi, he even professed to take seriously Kim Jong-un‚Äôs denial that he had anything to do with Otto Warmbier‚Äôs murder, as if rogue security services are kidnapping and torturing Americans on their own initiative in the most tightly controlled society on Earth.

All signs were that the North Koreans were heading to a diplomatic win, getting sanctions relief ‚Äî as well as a U.S. liaison office in Pyongyang and a formal end to the Korean War ‚Äî in exchange for steps to dismantle the Yongbyon enrichment facility. This is a version of the sucker‚Äôs deal that the U.S. has fallen for time and again with the North. Pyongyang‚Äôs play is to pocket any economic relief and diplomatic recognition and then cheat on its commitments. Indeed, President Trump revealed that we are aware of a second, heretofore unknown enrichment facility.

For whatever reason, though, the North Koreans pushed Trump on sanctions relief farther than he was willing to go, and the president left the table.

This avoids, for the time being, making the mistake Trump‚Äôs personal diplomacy was headed toward (although we are still foolishly scaling back joint military exercises with the South). Now the president should return to the robust program of economic, military, and diplomatic pressure that his administration was pursuing prior to this detour.

It is a temptation for all leaders, especially Trump, who makes everything personal, to overestimate how much a relationship and direct talks can overcome ineluctable strategic and ideological considerations. It‚Äôs time to realize that Kim Jong-un is not a promising young man. He‚Äôs not going to give up a nuclear program that is central to his regime‚Äôs existence. And he‚Äôll realistically sign on only to a deal that he believes extends the life of his dictatorship.

We hope the failure in Hanoi is the beginning of wisdom."

By Tammy Webber and Don Babwin / Associated Press

CHICAGO ‚Äî Embattled R&B star R. Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts in an interview that aired Thursday, a day after he was sent to jail for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is also facing felony charges that allege he sexually abused three girls and a woman in Chicago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ‚ÄúCBS This Morning.‚Äù He said his ex-wife was lying when she alleged he‚Äôd abused her, and his voice broke as he asked: ‚ÄúHow can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can‚Äôt work?‚Äù

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he couldn‚Äôt afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ‚Äúzero‚Äù relationship with his three children but knew they love him.

The interview, recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sex abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, Kelly whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will ‚Äî likely hoping the raw interview would help sway public opinion.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime series ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly,‚Äù which aired in January. The documentary alleged he held women captive and ran a ‚Äúsex cult.‚Äù

Experts said his appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That‚Äôs why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

‚ÄúIn my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,‚Äù said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ‚ÄúI would document every word they said ‚Ä¶ (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.‚Äù

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ‚Äúhistorically it‚Äôs a bad idea,‚Äù Birkett said.

One recent example was ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. Two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career.

In Kelly‚Äôs case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

‚ÄúA lot of the public already thinks he‚Äôs guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,‚Äù Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ‚Äúthis kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary‚Äù to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding: ‚ÄúHe may not know all the evidence against him.‚Äù

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she‚Äôs 14.

Kelly‚Äôs attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ‚Äúknowingly‚Äù have sex with underage girls.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äî but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ‚Äústick to a script.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,‚Äù he said.

On Wednesday‚Äôs broadcast, Kelly‚Äôs emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ‚Äúbig heart‚Äù who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this stuff! This is not me!‚Äù He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my (expletive) life.‚Äù

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù because of the sex-abuse allegations, he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child-support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for March 13.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly‚Äôs finances were ‚Äúa mess.‚Äù

Following the Wednesday court hearing, the publicist said that the singer ‚Äúfeels good‚Äù about the TV interview.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äî Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äî also are set to air. Savage‚Äôs parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day.

‚ÄúAt no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,‚Äù attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done ‚Äúlots of things wrong‚Äù when it comes to women, but he said he had apologized. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Rising from poverty on Chicago‚Äôs South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, ‚Äú12 Play,‚Äù which produced such popular sex-themed songs as ‚ÄúYour Body‚Äôs Callin‚Äô‚Äù and ‚ÄúBump N‚Äô Grind.‚Äù He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is ‚ÄúI Believe I Can Fly.‚Äù

(Feb. 28)

When we first saw Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch on television in the late 1980s, a sarcastic friend of mine wisecracked, ""Wow, that looks like a pedophile's paradise.""

I tried not to laugh. Like multitudes of others, I had been following Jackson's hit songs and dazzling dance moves since his early days with his brothers in the Jackson Five from Gary, Ind.

I excused his odd excesses -- his cosmetic surgeries, his pet chimp, his ranch in Santa Barbara County with its own amusement park and petting zoo -- as an understandable consequence of his breathtaking wealth and perhaps his urgent need to construct his own fantasyland to make up for the normal childhood he never had.

TRIBUNE COLUMNIST CLARENCE PAGE.

My excuse-making ended with the airing on Sunday and Monday of Dan Reed's unsettling HBO documentary, ""Leaving Neverland,"" a two-part, four-hour re-examination of sexual abuse charges by Wade Robson and James Safechuck, two men who say Jackson sexually abused them at the Neverland Ranch when they were children.

We can now add Jackson's name to those of R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, Woody Allen, Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and others whose commercial success has been disrupted by allegations of sexual misconduct that, in Cosby's case, resulted in a guilty verdict and prison on three counts of aggravated indecent assault.

Sure, it is important to remember, as the Jackson family points out in a response to the documentary, that Robson and Safechuck gave statements on the pop star's behalf in a 1993 sexual abuse case brought by a different boy and settled out of court. Robson also testified on Jackson's behalf in the 2005 case in which a jury found Jackson not guilty of child molestation and administering an intoxicating substance. In its statement, the Jackson family denounced the documentary as a ""public lynching.""

Yet the documentary and the hourlong town hall-style discussion led by Oprah Winfrey that followed make a gut-wrenching case study of what she calls a widely misunderstood and underappreciated aspect of child abuse: the grooming process in which the predator befriends the family, draws the child away from his or her parents and tightens emotional bonds with the child.

After noting that she has hosted 217 episodes on child sexual abuse on her TV talk shows, Winfrey concluded, ""Sexual abuse ... is also sexual seduction.""

That's a bracingly important point. Our stereotypes of pedophiles as violent rapists defy the more common reality of children being persuaded to sympathize with and aid the predator as a sign of love and devotion. Typically, these are children too young to understand what love or sexual relations are all about.

Still, one of the great mysteries that emerged in the early days of the Neverland scandal still haunts us: How could parents leave their children alone with Jackson for what became days at a time?

The answer appears to be a complicated combination of trust and denial by parents who were star-struck themselves by Jackson and his generosity in booking fancy suites and transportation for the families while he went off alone to sleep with their children. ""I always get what I want,"" one mother in the documentary quotes Jackson as saying to her. Indeed, many fans worldwide indulge and even worship superstars like Jackson in a way that can easily encourage a star's worst instincts -- and a deep sense of denial among the rest of us.

Or, as Oprah declared, ""Celebrity supersedes criminality.""

My biggest surprise in watching the Neverland documentary is how much it disturbingly echoed Lifetime's ""Surviving R. Kelly"" documentary, which preceded recent sexual abuse charges against him in late February.

In 2008, Kelly was found not guilty of child pornography charges connected to an alleged videotaped encounter with a 13-year-old girl. But the singer, whose real name is Robert Kelly, was indicted Feb. 21 in Chicago on 10 charges of aggravated criminal sexual abuse of four victims, three of whom were underage. Kelly has been released from jail on $100,000 bond.

In both cases, we again see celebrities facing renewed allegations of sexual misconduct after years of gossip and rumors. But this time we are in the #MeToo era, and the headwind that alleged victims used to face in trying to be heard largely has been replaced by a tailwind that helps them to be heard.

This does not mean, as the Jussie Smollett alleged hate crime hoax in Chicago should teach us, that all complaints are valid. Everyone is still entitled under our system of justice to be considered innocent until proved guilty. But alleged victims also have the right to have their complaint taken seriously.

Should we now boycott the artistic creations of controversial artists? I, for one, cannot hear the music of Jackson and Kelly and the comedy of Cosby without also feeling that a sense of revulsion has replaced my former sense of delight.

In his first interview since being arrested and charged on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse (for which three of the four alleged victims were underage at the time), R. Kelly sat down with CBS‚Äôs Gayle King Wednesday morning for a laborious two-hour conversation that put his endless ‚ÄúTrapped in the Closet‚Äù hip-hopera to shame.

From beginning to end, the interview was a catastrophe: Kelly accused the world of labelling him ‚ÄúLucifer‚Äù when he is simply ‚Äúa man‚Ä¶and by no means a monster;‚Äù he lapsed into a well-timed cry; he screamed and pointed into the camera so hysterically it verged on comical; he stood and erupted into a full-body tantrum, pacing the room and lording over King who warned, with the tone of a mother attempting to calm her child in a supermarket aisle, ‚ÄúRoberrrrt‚Ä¶‚Äù

Many are outraged saying that John Placek, who owns the billboard, is inciting racism and hate through his digital billboard displays, WPXI reports.

However, Placek disagrees that his messaging has racist implications.

According to Entertainment Tonight, the 36-year-old will be featured in next week‚Äôs spring premiere on Wednesday, March 13. Jussie plays Jamal Lyon in the series, the son of Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie Lyon (Taraji P. Henson), who run Empire Entertainment.

The show is currently in its fifth season, which premiered on September 26, 2018. The actor last appeared in Episode 9, ‚ÄúHad It From My Father,‚Äù which aired on December 5 and saw Jamal‚Äôs fiance Kai uncover secrets about his father and the company, causing some friction between the two. The upcoming episode kicks off the second half of Season 5, and will see Jamal and Kai ‚Äútry to figure out where they stand as a mystery begins to unravel.‚Äù

News of his appearance in next week‚Äôs episode did not go over well with some fans of the series, many of whom took to Twitter to express their distaste in his return.

‚ÄúAfter all the #JussieSmollett lies and drama. I could careless about #EmpireonFox returning next week. I been watching since season one‚Ä¶I‚Äôm done!‚Äù a third user wrote, adding in the hashtag ‚Äú#cancelEmpireonFox.‚Äù

Jussie‚Äôs return to television comes amid a major controversy surrounding the actor. In January, it was alleged that the star staged an attack on himself, which Chicago police now believe was orchestrated in an attempt to further his career. It is also alleged that a few weeks prior to the purported hoax attack, Smollett set himself a threatening letter that did not receive the attention he was hoping for.

The actor was charged with filing a fake police report ‚Äî a class four felony that could lead to a maximum of three years in prison. Jussie is currently out on $10,000 bond after surrendering to police in late February, and has maintained his innocence in the matter.

As The Inquisitr previously reported, Empire‚Äòs executive producers announced shortly after his arrest that Smollett would not be appearing in the season‚Äôs final two episodes, though Entertainment Tonight reports that he will still be paid for them.

In a statement, the show‚Äôs executive producers acknowledged that Jussie was an ‚Äúimportant member of our Empire family‚Äù but that they would be trusting the legal system to determine whether or not there is truth to the allegations against him.

‚ÄúWe are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season,‚Äù the statement read.

As of now, it is unclear how Jamal‚Äôs storyline will wrap up this season.

‚ÄúJussie Smollett hangs himself! Sets ‚Äòrace‚Äô relations back 100 years,‚Äù the billboard reads, according to Yahoo News.

Dozens of nurses and other staff members at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago were reportedly fired for improperly reviewing the medical records of actor Jussie Smollett, CBS 2 Chicago reports.

Five things to know:

1. Sources told CBS 2 Chicago the workers, including some nurses and other hospital staff, were terminated last week after gaining access to the actor's medical chart.

2. One nurse told CBS 2 Chicago she was fired after her shift Feb. 26 and escorted off of hospital property. She told the publication she never accessed Mr. Smollett's records and had simply scrolled past them while looking for another patient's name. The nurse said she was not asked any questions about the alleged incident before she was fired and was denied the chance to explain.

3. The nurse told the television station she plans to appeal the hospital's decision and that several other staffers were similarly fired for simply scrolling past Mr. Smollett's records.

4. Mr. Smollett arrived at the hospital Jan. 29, claiming he was assaulted by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him around 2 a.m., the report states. However, police claim the actor orchestrated the attack himself as a ""publicity stunt"" because he was upset with his salary on the television show ""Empire."" Police charged Mr. Smollett with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false policy report, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

5. A spokesperson for Northwestern Memorial told CBS 2 Chicago the hospital cannot comment on the employment status of any staff member.

CHICAGO ‚Äî R. Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, a day after the R&B star was jailed for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is charged with sexually abusing three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ‚ÄúCBS This Morning.‚Äù He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse, and his voice broke as he asked, ‚ÄúHow can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can‚Äôt work?‚Äù

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ‚Äúzero‚Äù relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

................................................................

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, he ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly,‚Äù which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a ‚Äúsex cult.‚Äù

Experts said Kelly‚Äôs appearance was risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That‚Äôs why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

‚ÄúIn my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,‚Äù said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ‚ÄúI would document every word they said ‚Ä¶ (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.‚Äù

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ‚Äúhistorically it‚Äôs a bad idea,‚Äù Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly‚Äôs case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

‚ÄúA lot of the public already thinks he‚Äôs guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,‚Äù Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ‚Äúthis kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary‚Äù to influence a potential jury pool.

................................................................

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locks himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding that the star ‚Äúmay not know all the evidence against him.‚Äù

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she‚Äôs 14. And police in Detroit were looking into a woman‚Äôs claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly‚Äôs attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ‚Äúknowingly‚Äù have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äî but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ‚Äústick to a script.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,‚Äù he said.

On Wednesday‚Äôs broadcast, Kelly‚Äôs emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ‚Äúbig heart‚Äù who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this stuff! This is not me!‚Äù He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my (expletive) life.‚Äù

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

The cringe-worthy moment was shared in a tweet by journalist Justin Baragona:

Fox News' Dana Perino has to correct Jesse Watters after he says ""hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the Jussie Smollett fiasco."" pic.twitter.com/xbZot8H0Yo ‚Äî Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) March 6, 2019

Watters was bashing R. Kelly for his alleged sexual abuse of minors and then moved on to discuss Kelly‚Äôs recent interview with CBS This Morning‚Äòs Gayle King, during which Kelly threw a tantrum and victimized himself. King has since been applauded (and made into a meme) for her calm as Kelly dramatically denied the charges against him. However, Watters felt the need to defend Kelly‚Äôs volatile behavior in the interview.

‚ÄúWhen he had this emotional outburst, I do question whether or not it was planned, but at the same time I see a man who was cornered,‚Äù Watters says in the clip shared by Baragona.

‚ÄúAnd he was acting like a child,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúI agree, hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco.‚Äù

The ‚ÄúSmollett fiasco‚Äù was a reference to the recent interview of actor Jussie Smollett by Good Morning America‚Äòs Roberts. Smollett, who in January claimed that he came under a racist attack by two men screaming ‚ÄúMAGA country,‚Äù has since been charged for staging the attack. The far-right loves to cite Smollett as proof that liberals are hysterical about racism and bigotry.

A panelist immediately corrected Watters, saying that it was not King but Roberts who did the interview. After he was corrected, Watters said, with even more cringe-worthy confidence, ‚ÄúOh, I knew that.‚Äù He then laughed, and others joined in.

To make clear he was truly sorry, not just looking for another laugh about Black people, Watters reportedly apologized on a whiteboard after the mishap, still wearing that smirk on his face.

Ilhan Omar‚Äôs (D-MN) anti-Semitism, but House Minority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) might have just taken the cake.

Clyburn, in an interview with the Hill‚Äôs Mike Ellis, basically told descendants of Holocaust survivors and those who were put in Franklin Delano Roosevelt‚Äôs Japanese internment camps to ‚Äúcheck their privilege‚Äù (h/t Seth Mandel).

The Hill described Clyburn‚Äôs comments thusly:

Clyburn came to Omar‚Äôs defense Wednesday, lamenting that many of the media reports surrounding the recent controversy have omitted mentioning that Omar, who was born in Somalia, had to flee the country to escape violence and spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp before coming to the United States. Her experience, Clyburn argued, is much more empirical ‚Äî and powerful ‚Äî than that of people who are generations removed from the Holocaust, Japanese internment camps during World War II and the other violent episodes that have marked history.

In case one suspects this is an uncharitable paraphrase, here‚Äôs what Clyburn said right after:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious about that. There are people who tell me, ‚ÄòWell, my parents are Holocaust survivors.‚Äô ‚ÄòMy parents did this.‚Äô It‚Äôs more personal with her,‚Äù Clyburn said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve talked to her, and I can tell you she is living through a lot of pain.‚Äù

But Clyburn wasn‚Äôt done. The Hill reports that Clyburn claimed to have a special appreciation for Omar‚Äôs experience after talking with Rep. Norman Mineta (D-CA), who was in an internment camp during World War II. Basically, he has a formerly interned friend, so he totally can‚Äôt be a bigot.

Further, Clyburn suggested Omar is the real victim in all this and that he would try to target a digital billboard in Pennsylvania he claimed is racist.

‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt be targeted. We‚Äôre going to target those people who had her picture on the Twin Towers,‚Äù Clyburn told the Hill. ‚ÄúThis resolution is going to be inclusive; it‚Äôs going to be expansive; and I might just try to add something to deal with that billboard that‚Äôs up in Pennsylvania this morning calling John Lewis and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus racists.‚Äù

So, Omar won‚Äôt be targeted for anti-Semitic remarks, but a random guy in Pennsylvania who put up billboards will be? The billboards take shots at ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù actor Jussie Smollett‚Äôs alleged hate crime hoax, and calls multiple black Democrats, including Lewis and Omar, ‚Äúracists.‚Äù Another billboard says ‚Äúwhites have rights.‚Äù The man who put up the billboards denied he was trying to be racist, saying he was trying to start a conversation that it‚Äôs not just whites who can be racist.

‚ÄúRacism is misunderstood in America and I want to have the conversation,‚Äù the man told WPXI. ‚ÄúWe need to get over: I‚Äôm black. You‚Äôre white. You‚Äôre Hispanic. Who cares? I don‚Äôt care about that. I do care about how you act and how you stand for my flag, our flag.‚Äù

Clyburn‚Äôs comments may be the most outrageous, but he is not the only one now defending Omar and anti-Semitism. Those vying for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination have rushed to defend Omar as well."

However, it appeared some people may have been overstepping to find out the truth.

Several nurses at Northwestern Hospital, where Smollett was treated after his alleged attack in Chicago in January, were fired for looking at the actor‚Äôs medical chart, according to a CBS report published Wednesday.

One of the nurses appealing her firing, claiming it was a misunderstanding and she simply scrolled by his chart. The unidentified nurse ‚Äúwas fired last week and believes many other nurses and staffers were fired for the same reason. The nurse says she was called in at the end of her shift last Tuesday, fired on the spot and escorted out of the hospital. She says she wasn‚Äôt asked any questions and never had a chance to offer an explanation. She says she never accessed the actor‚Äôs chart but simply scrolled past it when looking for another patient‚Äôs name. She‚Äôs appealing and believes other [sic] may have been fired for simply scrolling past the name as well.‚Äù

The hospital declined to comment.

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, ‚ÄúThis is MAGA country.‚Äù

By Feb. 21, he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false report.

The Chicago Police Department claimed Nigerian-American brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo told them the attack was orchestrated by the ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù actor and that they were paid $3,500. However, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were ‚Äúoverstating‚Äù and ‚Äúwent too far‚Äù when they said Jussie sent a hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself.

""Jussie Smollett You will die black fag"" Okay, I'm ready to fight. pic.twitter.com/h42Px47lvW ‚Äî ‚Ñùùïöùïîùïô ‚Ñçùï†ùïûùï† ‚Ñöùï¶ùïíùïü (@Homiekage) January 29, 2019

TMZ also reported, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They‚Äôre also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers‚Äô apartment.‚Äù The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson may have also gone too far when he said Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they ‚Äúobtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‚Äòattack.‚Äô The memo line reads, ‚Äò5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don‚Äôt Go.'‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Go‚Äù is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

TMZ also reported, ‚ÄúThere are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 ‚Äî the day before the ‚Äòattack‚Äô ‚Äî Bon [Abel Osundairo] wrote, ‚ÄòI know you‚Äôre traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.‚Äô Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker‚Äôs peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ‚ÄòThis is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.'‚Äù The $3,500 breakdown was reportedly ‚Äú$600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks,‚Äù according to TMZ reports.

Smollett has maintained his innocence.

Kelly interview that aired on CBS This Morning. During the interview, Kelly lashed out dramatically at his interviewer, Gayle King, screaming and pounding his fists, as she asked him pointed questions about the sexual abuse allegations he is currently facing, and those he has faced in the past.

Through the entire encounter, King remained calm in the face of rage and the possibility of physical harm - leaving viewers in awe of her composure.

It didn't go unnoticed at Fox. But the moment was short-lived when it became clear Jesse Watters didn't know which interviewer he was praising.

Here's the exchange on The Five:

Jesse Watters: Hats off to Gayle King, for totally redeeming herself after the [Jussie] Smollett fiasco.

Juan Williams: Janet, I, you know...

Dana Perino: That was not Gayle King.

Watters: Oh. I knew that.

[laughter]

Perino: Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview.

Williams: One of the things that I think lots of people...

Watters: Sorry for Robin Roberts out there.

[laughter]

Williams: Go right ahead, Jesse. It's cool.

Watters: I apologize.

Robin Roberts faced criticism after her interview with Jussie Smollett on Feb. 14 about the alleged hate crime committed against him. The interview aired on ABC's Good Morning America in the final days prior to his arrest for filing a false police report.

The interview was Smollett's first detailed public account of the alleged attack.

""I will never be the man that this did not happen to,"" he told Roberts. ""I am forever changed,""

At the time, police said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was assaulted around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two ""unknown offenders"" who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on the actor and wrapped a rope around his neck.

One day after the interview aired, police announced they had interviewed two persons of interest who had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation."" On Feb. 21, Smollett was arrested and charged with falsifying a police report. Police said he concocted the story of a hate crime because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"" for his work on ""Empire,"" and that he paid the two men $3,500 to stage the attack after the threatening letter - which police suspect Smollett sent to himself at the Cinespace Chicago Film Studios - failed to attract attention.

Roberts later spoke about the hesitation she felt before that interview, noting she had doubts as to whether she should do it in the first place.

Roberts called her position a ""no-win"" situation.

A Cook County Sheriff's Office official says singer Kelly won't be released from jail until he pays $161,000 in back child support he owes. Sheriff's office spokeswoman Sophia Ansari says Kelly was taken into custody Wednesday during a hearing over the child support and that his next hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. Associated Press

&B singer R. Kelly gestures while making a point during an interview with Gayle King on ""CBS This Morning"" broadcast. The R&B singer gave his first interview since being charged last month with sexually abusing four females dating back to 1998, including three underage girls. Kelly has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse. Associated Press

R. Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ""destroying"" his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, a day after the R&B star was jailed for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is charged with sexually abusing three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ""CBS This Morning."" He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse, and his voice broke as he asked, ""How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can't work?""

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ""zero"" relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, he ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a ""sex cult.""

Experts said Kelly's appearance was risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That's why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

""In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,"" said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ""I would document every word they said ... (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.""

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ""historically it's a bad idea,"" Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly's case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

""A lot of the public already thinks he's guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,"" Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ""this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary"" to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locks himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding that the star ""may not know all the evidence against him.""

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she's 14. And police in Detroit were looking into a woman's claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ""knowingly"" have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview -- but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ""stick to a script.""

""If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,"" he said.

On Wednesday's broadcast, Kelly's emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ""big heart"" who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ""I didn't do this stuff! This is not me!"" He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ""I'm fighting for my (expletive) life.""

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ""not about music.""

""I'm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can't do it"" because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ""You all just don't want to believe it.""

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ""expecting to leave. He didn't come here to go to jail,"" said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly's finances were ""a mess.""

Now, the employee ‚Äî an administrator with an advanced degree ‚Äî is out of a job, after she was told she‚Äôd inappropriately accessed Smollett‚Äôs records, violating hospital rules.

The administrator, who didn‚Äôt want her name used, told the Chicago Sun-Times she was stunned by her dismissal ‚Äî and she suspects others may have been fired or disciplined for doing the same thing.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get any information about [Smollett]. I never clicked on his name and entered his record,‚Äù said the former administrator.

A Northwestern spokesman, citing privacy rules and company policy, declined to comment Thursday.

CBS 2 Chicago first reported the story. A nurse, who was not named, told CBS 2 Chicago she simply scrolled past Smollett‚Äôs chart without actually accessing it.

The nurse said it was a misunderstanding, but she wasn‚Äôt given the chance to offer an explanation. The story, citing unnamed sources, says many more Northwestern employees have been fired in connection with the incident.

Smollett was treated in the hospital‚Äôs emergency room on Jan. 29 after a downtown attack that he claimed was racially motivated, but that police and prosecutors now say was a hoax intended to generate publicity.

The worker who spoke to the Sun-Times said she did not know how many workers were involved.

The day Smollett was at the hospital, his arrival and the alleged attack were all over the news, the worker said.

An employee in another department came to her desk and asked if Smollett been admitted under an alias, the worker said, adding that she didn‚Äôt ask why the information was needed because she believed it to be a professional request.

A few weeks later, the worker was called to a meeting with her boss and a representative from human resources, the worker said.

‚ÄúThey called it a ‚Äòhuge breach,‚Äô and I said, ‚ÄòIf that‚Äôs the case, don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs a training issue?'‚Äù the worker said.

Late last month, she was called to another meeting and told she was being fired.

‚ÄúThey again said I accessed [Smollett‚Äôs] record, and I said I didn‚Äôt access his record,‚Äù the worker said. She said she had worked at Northwestern for two years and had no previous disciplinary issues.

Cook County prosecutors have charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, the charge used for filing a false police report.

Prosecutors say Smollett enlisted the help of two brothers, one of whom worked out with the actor and had been a stand-in on ‚ÄúEmpire.‚Äù Smollett later wrote a check for $3,500 to one of the brothers, prosecutors say.

The brothers were detained and then released without being charged.

Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ""destroying"" his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts in an interview that aired Thursday, a day after he was sent to jail for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is also facing felony charges that allege he sexually abused three girls and a woman in Chicago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ""CBS This Morning."" He said his ex-wife was lying when she alleged he'd abused her, and his voice broke as he asked: ""How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can't work?""

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he couldn't afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ""zero"" relationship with his three children but knew they love him. Kelly

The interview, recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sex abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, Kelly whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will ‚Äî likely hoping the raw interview would help sway public opinion.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which aired in January. The documentary alleged he held women captive and ran a ""sex cult.""

Experts said his appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That's why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

""In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,"" said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ""I would document every word they said ... (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.""

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ""historically it's a bad idea,"" Birkett said.

One recent example was ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. Two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career.

In Kelly's case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

""A lot of the public already thinks he's guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,"" Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ""this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary"" to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding: ""He may not know all the evidence against him.""

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she's 14.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ""knowingly"" have sex with underage girls.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äî but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ""stick to a script.""

""If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,"" he said.

On Wednesday's broadcast, Kelly's emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ""big heart"" who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ""I didn't do this stuff! This is not me!"" He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ""I'm fighting for my (expletive) life.""

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ""not about music.""

""I'm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can't do it"" because of the sex-abuse allegations, he shouted. ""You all just don't want to believe it.""

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ""expecting to leave. He didn't come here to go to jail,"" said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child-support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for March 13.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly's finances were ""a mess.""

Following the Wednesday court hearing, the publicist said that the singer ""feels good"" about the TV interview.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äî Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äî also are set to air. Savage's parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day.

""At no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,"" attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done ""lots of things wrong"" when it comes to women, but he said he had apologized. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Rising from poverty on Chicago's South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, ""12 Play,"" which produced such popular sex-themed songs as ""Your Body's Callin'"" and ""Bump N' Grind."" He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is ""I Believe I Can Fly."""

Kelly interview this week - but mistook her for Robin Roberts instead.

The Fox News host mixed up the two African-American journalists while he discussed the R. Kelly and Michael Jackson abuse allegations on The Five.

'Hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco,' he said, referring to Roberts' interview with Empire star Jussie Smollett on Good Morning America last month.

Watters' co-hosts then began to giggle before Dana Perino corrected him.

'Hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco,' he said, referring to Roberts' interview with Empire star Jussie Smollett last month (left). King is pictured right during this week's R. Kelly interview

'That was not Gayle King,' she said.

'Oh, I knew that,' Watters replied.

'Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview,' Perino then added.

Co-host Juan Williams tried to move the conversation back to the original topic, only for Watters' to interrupt him with an apology to the journalists.

'Sorry for Robin Roberts out there,' he said.

'Go right ahead, Jesse,' Williams replied.

'I apologize,' Watters added as his hosts giggled and he shook his head with embarrassment.

Watters later held up a whiteboard on the show that read: 'I'm sorry Gayle + Robin'.

King has received high praise for keeping her cool while interviewing Kelly for CBS Morning this week.

The R&B star lashed out at King as she questioned him about the numerous sexual abuse charges and allegations he is currently facing.

At one point Kelly called Gayle's questions 'stupid' and then jumped out of his chair, wildly gesticulating just inches away from her.

But King remained unfazed and kept quiet as Kelly thrashed about.

'I really wasn't worried. I never thought that he was going to hurt me,' Gayle, who revealed best friend Oprah called to check on her after the interview, said on CBS.

Watters later held up a whiteboard on the show that read: 'I'm sorry Gayle + Robin' (pictured)

'I thought I might get accidentally clobbered, but I didn't think he'd deliberately try to hurt me. I never felt in danger talking to him.'

Roberts' interview with Smollett aired just two days before he was arrested for allegedly filing a false police report.

The Empire star had made headlines last month after claiming he had been attacked in a hate crime, saying he was targeted because he is a gay black man.

Smollett's Good Morning America interview was his first public account of the alleged attack.

Roberts, 58, told an audience in Brooklyn on Monday that she tried to be as neutral as possible in her questioning of Smollett, but knew that it was a tricky line to follow.

King has received high praise for keeping her cool while interviewing Kelly for CBS Morning this week as he lashed out over her questions

'I'm a black gay woman, he's a black gay man,' she said as she spoke about the pressure she felt to represent the LGBT community.

'He's saying that there's a hate crime, so if I'm too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ""You don't believe a brother"". If I'm too light on him, it's like, ""Oh, because you are in the community, you're giving him a pass.'''

'It was a no-win situation for me,' she explained.

Roberts also revealed she didn't know if she wanted to do the interview, calling it one of the 'most challenging' of her career."

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she‚Äôs 14.

Kelly‚Äôs attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ‚Äúknowingly‚Äù have sex with underage girls.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äì but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ‚Äústick to a script.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,‚Äù he said.

On Wednesday‚Äôs broadcast, Kelly‚Äôs emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ‚Äúbig heart‚Äù who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this stuff! This is not me!‚Äù He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my (expletive) life.‚Äù

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù because of the sex-abuse allegations, he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child-support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for March 13.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly‚Äôs finances were ‚Äúa mess.‚Äù

Following the Wednesday court hearing, the publicist said that the singer ‚Äúfeels good‚Äù about the TV interview.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äì Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äì also are set to air. Savage‚Äôs parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day.

‚ÄúAt no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,‚Äù attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done ‚Äúlots of things wrong‚Äù when it comes to women, but he said he had apologized. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Rising from poverty on Chicago‚Äôs South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, ‚Äú12 Play,‚Äù which produced such popular sex-themed songs as ‚ÄúYour Body‚Äôs Callin‚Äô‚Äù and ‚ÄúBump N‚Äô Grind.‚Äù He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is ‚ÄúI Believe I Can Fly.‚Äù

But Dave what about the girls? Why aren‚Äôt they at fault?

Because girls can be dazzled by celebrities ‚Äì as can boys. When I was 12, I was dazzled by Angela Cartwright and Sharon from the Mickey Mouse Club. I had no way of getting to Los Angeles. But I can tell you, had one of them offered me a plane ticket I‚Äôd have gone and lied about my age.

Especially if my parents had given me permission. Like with R. Kelly‚Äôs girlfriend, Clary, who told Gayle King that her parents instructed her to tell Kelly that she was 18, when she was actually 17 years old.

Wait, 18? She sounds like about age 12 even now! When you‚Äôre 30 years older than your date, the burden is on you.

This whole saga should remind us why we have elaborate and expensive marriage customs ‚Äì both families may be in hock, but at least they‚Äôre prepared for their kids to move out and have sex.

Instead, here, we are witnessing the fifth remake of a Star is Born, except with R. Kelly in place of Bradley Cooper. And that is very different movie."

Sheriff's office spokeswoman Sophia Ansari says Kelly was taken into custody Wednesday during a hearing over the child support and that his next hearing is scheduled for next Wednesday, March 13. (Cook County Sheriff's Office via AP)

CHICAGO -- Embattled R&B star R. Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ""destroying"" his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts in an interview that aired Thursday, a day after he was sent to jail for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is also facing felony charges that allege he sexually abused three girls and a woman in Chicago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ""CBS This Morning."" He said his ex-wife was lying when she alleged he'd abused her, and his voice broke as he asked: ""How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can't work?""

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he couldn't afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ""zero"" relationship with his three children but knew they love him.

The interview, recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sex abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, Kelly whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will -- likely hoping the raw interview would help sway public opinion.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which aired in January. The documentary alleged he held women captive and ran a ""sex cult.""

Experts said his appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That's why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

""In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,"" said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ""I would document every word they said ... (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.""

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ""historically it's a bad idea,"" Birkett said.

One recent example was ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. Two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career.

In Kelly's case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

""A lot of the public already thinks he's guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,"" Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ""this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary"" to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding: ""He may not know all the evidence against him.""

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she's 14.

Reps for ABC declined to comment. Reps for CBS did not immediately respond to request for comment. On Wednesday however, Watters was far from alone in heaping praise on King, who has increasingly become CBS News‚Äô most indispensable anchor.

On Twitter, fans from across the spectrum said her work ‚Äî particularly during Kelly‚Äôs more emotional moments ‚Äî had been a master class of interviewing.

Kelly says ex-wife destroyed his name, others stole money","['Tammy Webber', 'Don Babwin']",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4325840.1551940400!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['stole', 'sexual', 'interview', 'attorney', 'money', 'child', 'sex', 'prosecutors', 'r', 'women', 'kellys', 'destroyed', 'exwife', 'kelly', 'singer']","CHICAGO -- Embattled R&B star R. Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ""destroying"" his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, a day after he was sent to jail for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is also facing felony charges that allege he sexually abused three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ""CBS This Morning."" He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse and his voice broke as he asked: ""How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can't work?""

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he couldn't afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ""zero"" relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, Kelly whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will -- likely hoping the raw interview would help sway public opinion.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a ""sex cult.""

Experts said Kelly's appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That's why most defence attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

""In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defence,"" said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ""I would document every word they said ... (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.""

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ""historically it's a bad idea,"" Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors allege.

In Kelly's case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

""A lot of the public already thinks he's guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,"" Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ""this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary"" to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defence, Thiagarajah said, adding: ""He may not know all the evidence against him.""

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she's 14.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ""knowingly"" have sex with underage girls.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview -- but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ""stick to a script.""

""If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,"" he said.

On Wednesday's broadcast, Kelly's emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ""big heart"" who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ""I didn't do this stuff! This is not me!"" He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ""I'm fighting for my (expletive) life.""

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ""not about music.""

""I'm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can't do it"" because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ""You all just don't want to believe it.""

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ""expecting to leave. He didn't come here to go to jail,"" said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defence attorney said at the time that Kelly's finances were ""a mess.""

After Wednesday's hearing, the publicist said that the singer ""feels good"" about the TV interview.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly -- Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary -- also are set to air. Savage's parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day.

""At no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,"" attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done ""lots of things wrong"" when it comes to women, but he said he had apologized. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centred on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Rising from poverty on Chicago's South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, ""12 Play,"" which produced such popular sex-themed songs as ""Your Body's Callin""' and ""Bump N' Grind."" He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is ""I Believe I Can Fly.""

A nurse at Northwestern Hospital told CBS Chicago she was fired for allegedly accessing his medical chart and says she believes other nurses and staffers were fired for the same reason. The nurse denied the allegation, calling it a misunderstanding.

The nurse told the TV station that she was appealing her dismissal and believes she and others may have been fired for simply scrolling past Smollett's name while looking for another patient.

A spokesperson for the hospital said a company policy prevents the hospital from commenting on the employment status of any employee.

The ""Empire"" star was admitted to the hospital on January 29 after he was allegedly the victim of a homophobic and racist attack. Police now believe Smollett staged the attack and he has since been arrested on charges of filing a false police report.

Kelly remains in a Chicago jail after he said he couldn‚Äôt afford to pay $161,000 in back child support, as more of his nationally televised interview airs.

The R&B star blames his ex-wife for ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù his name and says others have stolen from his bank account.

‚ÄúCBS This Morning‚Äù aired the second installment of its interview with the embattled singer Thursday.

The accused workers were reportedly fired on the spot, and without much explanation, after Northwestern completed its review.

The reason for any possible interest in Smollett‚Äôs charts or health records is because of his ‚Äúhoax‚Äù case that rocked the nation recently.

Smollett had gotten into hot water back on Jan. 29, when he‚Äôd been rushed to Northwestern Hospital for treatment of wounds. No strangeness there‚Äìthe public thought at first‚Äìuntil Smollett claimed that he had been attacked in a hate crime for being black/African-American and a gay man, and his claims turned out to be bogus, according to Chicago police and the city‚Äôs mayor, Rahm Emmanuel:

Smollett had claimed that, as he was walking home from a Subway, the popular chain located at E. Lower North Water Street in Chicago, two people yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, and proceeded to beat him up.

??????: 'Empire' Star Jussie Smollett Beaten in Homophobic Attack By MAGA Supportershttps://t.co/gtqDkd02sr ‚Äî TMZ (@TMZ) January 29, 2019

Chicago police called Smollett‚Äôs allegedly staged attack a ‚Äúpublicity stunt,‚Äù and expressed outrage that he had staged the attack because he was upset with his salary. Smollett has been freed on bond, after his Twitter-gasp-worthy arrest and has pleaded not guilty.

The social media and offline hype around the Smollett story naturally filled the talk waves of Chicago and the world‚Äìand now reports are saying that Northwestern Hospital‚Äôs own staff might have gotten carried away.

Sources from various reports are saying that dozens of workers have been fired on the spot, after they allegedly gained access to the Empire actor‚Äôs medical records.

The United States‚Äô HIPAA laws expressly prohibit unauthorized access to any patient‚Äôs medical records without that patient‚Äôs knowledge and consent.

One of the unnamed nurses who was fired, claims to CBS Chicago that she never herself even accessed Smollett‚Äôs chart.

However, truth has become a spotlighted issue in Chicago, when it comes to Smollett‚Äôs case, and Northwestern Hospital‚Äôs stance is that it clearly does not believe this nurse.

According to CBS‚Äô reports, the nurse was fired last week, and the nurse says that many other nurses and staffers who were fired, were probably for the same reason she was fired.

She says that not only Northwestern terminate her, they escorted her straight out of the hospital.

This former Northwestern nurse is speaking out because she said that those who fired her at the hospital never asked her any investigative questions. No explanation was asked from her either.

She maintains that she was simply scrolling to look at another patient‚Äôs name‚Äìnot Smollett‚Äôs, and that she may have been fired simply because of the scroll.

This nurse who was fired plans to appeal her case with Northwestern Hospital.

Whether her appeal will go anywhere is highly debatable‚Äìas the hospital does not appear to be changing their termination decisions any time soon.

Of note, several other nurses, perhaps dozens of workers who were formerly staffed at Northwestern Hospital have been fired, and this unnamed nurse is adamant that many of them may have been fired for ‚Äúsimply scrolling past‚Äù Smollett‚Äôs name as well.

Northwestern Hospital is standing by its decisions so far:

Northwestern Hospital did not comment more explicitly on the hospital workers‚Äô terminations, when probed by CBS‚Äôs news team.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Our company policy prevents me from commenting on the employment status of any of our employees,‚Äù said Christopher N. King, the hospital‚Äôs media director.

Though it is also reported that Smollett was clearly treated at Northwestern Hospital, King additionally pointed out that HIPAA would not even let him acknowledge whether any patient, Smollett or not, was treated at the hospital.

‚ÄúHIPAA prevents me from acknowledging if a patient received care at Northwestern Memorial Hospital or any other Northwestern Medicine hospital,‚Äù King said, remaining tight-lipped about both the hospital‚Äôs discoveries of their workers‚Äìand of Smollett himself as a patient.

His careful, heavily guarded, and private response prohibiting access to outside parties, is, incidentally, the expected protocol for health-related matters.

Afterward, celebrities gave their sympathies through various forms as well as vows to find justice. Another group of people stated that Smollett staged the alleged attack due to rumors of being kicked off the show after the Chicago Police Department stated that they wished to talk to Smollett once again about the incident.

Recently, the Chicago Police Chief stated that Smollett orchestrated the attack, while Queen Latifah said that she stands with Smollett until further evidence is shown. The public doesn‚Äôt know who to believe.



My point isn‚Äôt necessarily to bash Smollett, because there is a lack of information from primary sources, but to build on a larger problem that happens in our society.



Public figures are individuals who have developed a following either through their artistic or political success or mere wealth.



I do understand the need for such people, given their ability to trickle down information, values and ideas in a way that other institutions may not be able to, but their existence does create problems like this incident. The public doesn‚Äôt know who to believe, and people of similar status often choose a side.



These influential people are on our cable news channels, on columns like these and at conferences. They are our celebrities and even our professors. In fact, we listen to many on a daily basis.



When select individuals have a microphone, physical or virtual, it is powerful in our world ‚Äî so loud because, through one way or another, they are able to move the trajectory of society. So when the possibility of misinformation, or even a misdirection of a quote is possible, we all must be careful.



We all have individuals, organizations or institutions that we look up to but that we should never take at complete face value. We give them power by consuming their information.



Another example of this is during the Clinton presidency when we saw the passing of the ‚ÄúViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act,‚Äù a bill seen as the largest crime bill ever passed. The act was quite extensively implemented with more prisons, more officers, the expansion of the death penalty and even more statutes to charge individuals with.



The Clinton administration was a key factor in its passing, but Bill Clinton later stated that he regretted portions of the bill. One failure here was the lack of consultation with other opinion leaders with different stances on the approach to crime, but the biggest failure was ultimately the public being too trusting of the opinion leaders rather than the politicians or the consultants.



These actions destroyed countless lives and damaged countless communities as a result.



As humans, we have a tendency to search for public figures and value their opinions, which is fine, but we shouldn‚Äôt take every statement or action by people like Jussie Smollett or Bill Clinton at face value because we are all humans, after all.

The accused workers were reportedly fired on the spot, and without much explanation, after Northwestern completed its review.

The reason for any possible interest in Smollett‚Äôs charts or health records is because of his ‚Äúhoax‚Äù case that rocked the nation recently.

Smollett had gotten into hot water back on Jan. 29, when he‚Äôd been rushed to Northwestern Hospital for treatment of wounds. No strangeness there‚Äìthe public thought at first‚Äìuntil Smollett claimed that he had been attacked in a hate crime for being black/African-American and a gay man, and his claims turned out to be bogus, according to Chicago police and the city‚Äôs mayor, Rahm Emmanuel:

Smollett had claimed that, as he was walking home from a Subway, the popular chain located at E. Lower North Water Street in Chicago, two people yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, and proceeded to beat him up.

Smollett‚Äôs claims had drawn so much sympathy from celebrities and the internet‚Äìwith Smollett even sitting down for an interview with ABC‚Äôs Robin Roberts to retell his alleged attack story‚Ä¶

American rapper and actor Queen Latifah says she will stand by Empire actor Jussie Smollett until she sees proof that he staged a hate attack on himself. Smollett has been charged with filing a false police report, and was last week slammed by Chicago police officers for taking advantage ‚Äúof the pain and anger of racism to promote his career‚Äù.

But Queen Latifah said, ‚ÄúThe guy I have seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who is very kind and who is always been cool and sweet. And that is just the guy I know. So, until I can see some definitive proof, which I have not seen yet, then, you know, I got to go with him until I see otherwise.‚Äù

Before the case erupted, Smollett last summer told Billboard that he was struggling with the pressures of fame. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in my 30s and I‚Äôm trying my best to learn that I can‚Äôt bend anymore. I‚Äôm about to break,‚Äù he said.

Queen Latifah, who once appeared on Empire in a crossover episode with Smollett, said on a news show, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know what to make of it. All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.‚Äù

Smollett reported in January that he was attacked by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs. Chicago police initially called it a possible hate crime, but now say that Smollett hired two acquaintances from Empire (brothers Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo) to help him stage the assault."

Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif., rich white), the first grandmother to be elected House minority leader and also the first grandmother elected to be speaker of the House, was shocked, shocked, absolutely shocked, I tell you, but not too upset when discovering then-Minnesota state representative Ilhan Omar's multiple bigoted tweets (since deleted for some odd reason) against Israel. Pelosi was so OK with these euphemistically deemed ""very bad"" tweets (according to the know-it-all East-Coast New York Times) that she appointed the brand-new first Somali Muslim black female refugee (have I missed any significant identifiers?) in Congress, Ilhan Omar (D), to the coveted House Foreign Affairs Committee. Yes, that means she receives highly secret intelligence briefings. Pelosi was also not too disturbed that several years ago, Omar was also quite OK with other Somali refugees living in Minnesota leaving to join ISIS, which some, including the U.S. State Department, think is a terrorist organization. During their trial in Minnesota, she wrote and told a judge to give in to these terrorists, to be nice to them, to show compassion toward them, or they would suffer. If not, she continued, hinting at her approval of extortion, they would not only continue with terrorism, but encourage others to do the same.

""The best deterrent to fanaticism is a system of compassion[.] ... We must alter our attitude and approach; if we truly want to effect change, we should refocus our efforts on inclusion and rehabilitation. ... ""Incarcerating 20-year-old men for 30 or 40 years is essentially a life sentence. Society will have no expectations of the to-be 50- or 60-year-old released prisoners; it will view them with distrust and revulsion,"" read Omar's letter to the judge, as obtained by FOX 9 of Minneapolis-St. Paul. ""Such punitive measures not only lack efficacy, they inevitably create an environment in which extremism can flourish, aligning with the presupposition of terrorist recruitment[.]"" Did I mention that Omar will receive highly secret intelligence briefings? As does House Speaker Pelosi, who presumably does not have sympathy for ISIS terrorists. Presumably. Some members of Congress, who were not OK with Omar's many anti-Jewish tweets and other public statements, put together a mild resolution condemning anti-Semitism ‚Äî i.e., anti-Jewish racist hate ‚Äî which was set to be voted on on Wednesday, March 6. Pelosi was somewhat OK with that. Whoops! Others weren't. Linda Sarsour, the bigoted anti-Jewish, anti-Christian, somewhat anti-men leader of the annual January anti-President Donald J. Trump (R) gathering, misleadingly labeled a Women's March, was so not OK with this, posting a bigoted statement: Nancy is a typical white feminist upholding the patriarchy doing the dirty work of powerful white men. Sarsour continued her rant, rationally whining about something called Islamophobia and its acceptance. According to the ethos of liberalism, Sarsour can't be a racist because she is a politically correct minority ‚Äî two, in fact: Muslim and female. Another protected bigot, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-no Amazon jobs for N.Y. because world ends in 12 years so no kids for me) agreed, asking, But what about other forms of bigotry? She apparently was too busy worrying about farting cows in Iowa to notice that Rep. Steve King, a Republican from Iowa, was removed from his committee assignments because of alleged racist statements. So, perhaps because powerful males of other politically correct backgrounds also strongly objected to this resolution, typically white feminist Nancy Pelosi caved, postponing the vote so the resolution can be modified. The modified resolution will state that bigotry bad. Bigotry and racism defined by liberals bad; all other forms of bigotry and racism that we don't think are bigotry and racism are fine. Additionally, doubting reports of racist attacks by approved minorities such as Jussie Smollett and American Indian Nathan Phillips is racist because they have suffered so much. It is also racist to prove them wrong. The typical Democrats will be totally OK with this modified racist resolution. And unapproved minorities such as Jews, religious Christians, and conservatives will continue to endure the racism of the politically correct racists. Image: Leopaltik1242 via Wikimedia Commons."

Kelly in jail over child support,['Rawaa Talass'],http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/main-image/2019/03/07/1482181-854067293.jpg,"['support', 'defense', 'attorney', 'child', 'sex', 'women', 'r', 'prosecutors', 'kellys', 'jail', 'interview', 'kelly', 'singer']","CHICAGO: R. Kelly‚Äôs day began with a nationally televised broadcast in which he whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe him: He‚Äôd never had sex with anyone under 17 and never held anyone against her will.

The day ended with a trip to jail after the embattled R&B singer told a judge he could not pay $161,000 in back child support he owes his children‚Äôs mother.

Kelly no doubt hoped the raw interview aired Wednesday on ‚ÄúCBS This Morning‚Äù would help sway public opinion about the charges filed last month that accuse him of sexually abusing three girls and a woman. The interview was his first public defense since being charged and the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime series ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly,‚Äù which aired in January. The documentary alleged that he held women captive and ran a ‚Äúsex cult.‚Äù

But experts said his appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That‚Äôs why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

‚ÄúIn my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,‚Äù said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ‚ÄúI would document every word they said ... (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.‚Äù

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but, Birkett said, ‚Äúhistorically it‚Äôs a bad idea.‚Äù

One recent example was ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù identifying two people in a still photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. Two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career.

In Kelly‚Äôs case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

‚ÄúA lot of the public already thinks he‚Äôs guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,‚Äù Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ‚Äúthis kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary‚Äù to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said. ‚ÄúHe may not know all the evidence against him.‚Äù

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15, and a videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she‚Äôs 14. Kelly‚Äôs attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ‚Äúknowingly‚Äù have sex with underage girls.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äî but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ‚Äústick to a script.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,‚Äù he said.

On Wednesday‚Äôs broadcast, Kelly‚Äôs emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ‚Äúbig heart‚Äù who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this stuff! This is not me!‚Äù He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my (expletive) life.‚Äù

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù because of the sex-abuse allegations, he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson, who said Kelly was prepared to pay $50,000 to $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child-support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for March 13.

After his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago, Kelly spent a weekend in jail before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly‚Äôs finances were ‚Äúa mess.‚Äù

Following the court hearing, the publicist said that the singer ‚Äúfeels good‚Äù about the TV interview.

CBS said it interviewed Kelly for 80 minutes. More of the interview is expected to air Thursday.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äî Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äî also are set to air Thursday. Savage‚Äôs parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years and asked Kelly to make her available to talk to them.

‚ÄúAt no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,‚Äù attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done ‚Äúlots of things wrong‚Äù when it comes to women, but he said he had apologized. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Rising from poverty on Chicago‚Äôs South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, ‚Äú12 Play,‚Äù which produced such popular sex-themed songs as ‚ÄúYour Body‚Äôs Callin‚Äô‚Äù and ‚ÄúBump N‚Äô Grind.‚Äù He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is ‚ÄúI Believe I Can Fly.‚Äù"

Kelly says ex-wife destroyed his name, others stole money

Lazarus Jean-Baptiste / CBS via AP

CHICAGO (AP) ‚Äî R. Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ""destroying"" his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, a day after the R&B star was jailed for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is charged with sexually abusing three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ""CBS This Morning."" He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse, and his voice broke as he asked, ""How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can't work?""

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ""zero"" relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, he ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a ""sex cult.""

Experts said Kelly's appearance was risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That's why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

""In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,"" said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ""I would document every word they said ... (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.""

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ""historically it's a bad idea,"" Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly's case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

""A lot of the public already thinks he's guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,"" Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ""this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary"" to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locks himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding that the star ""may not know all the evidence against him.""

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she's 14. And police in Detroit were looking into a woman's claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ""knowingly"" have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äî but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ""stick to a script.""

""If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,"" he said.

On Wednesday's broadcast, Kelly's emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ""big heart"" who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ""I didn't do this stuff! This is not me!"" He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ""I'm fighting for my (expletive) life.""

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ""not about music.""

""I'm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can't do it"" because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ""You all just don't want to believe it.""

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ""expecting to leave. He didn't come here to go to jail,"" said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly's finances were ""a mess.""

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äî Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äî also are set to air. Savage's parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying on Wednesday that Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day.

R. Kelly's day began with a nationally televised broadcast in which he whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe him: He'd never had sex with anyone under 17 and never held anyone against her will.

The day ended with a trip to jail after the embattled R&B singer told a judge he could not pay $161,000 in back child support he owes his children's mother.

Kelly no doubt hoped the raw interview aired Wednesday on ""CBS This Morning"" would help sway public opinion about the charges filed last month that accuse him of sexually abusing three girls and a woman.

One recent example was ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago.

CHICAGO -- Embattled R&B star R. Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ""destroying"" his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, a day after he was sent to jail for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is also facing felony charges that allege he sexually abused three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ""CBS This Morning."" He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse and his voice broke as he asked: ""How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can't work?""

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he couldn't afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ""zero"" relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, Kelly whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will - likely hoping the raw interview would help sway public opinion.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a ""sex cult.""

Experts said Kelly's appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That's why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

""In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,"" said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ""I would document every word they said ... (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.""

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ""historically it's a bad idea,"" Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly's case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

""A lot of the public already thinks he's guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,"" Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ""this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary"" to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding: ""He may not know all the evidence against him.""

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she's 14. And police in Detroit are looking into a woman's claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ""knowingly"" have sex with underage girls. He wasn't immediately available Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview - but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ""stick to a script.""

""If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,"" he said.

On Wednesday's broadcast, Kelly's emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ""big heart"" who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ""I didn't do this stuff! This is not me!"" He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ""I'm fighting for my (expletive) life.""

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ""not about music.""

""I'm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can't do it"" because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ""You all just don't want to believe it.""

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ""expecting to leave. He didn't come here to go to jail,"" said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly's finances were ""a mess.""

After Wednesday's hearing, the publicist said that the singer ""feels good"" about the TV interview.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly - Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary - also are set to air. Savage's parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day.

""At no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,"" attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done ""lots of things wrong"" when it comes to women, but he said he had apologized. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Rising from poverty on Chicago's South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, ""12 Play,"" which produced such popular sex-themed songs as ""Your Body's Callin'"" and ""Bump N' Grind."" He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is ""I Believe I Can Fly.""

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ‚Äúzero‚Äù relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly‚Äôs case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

‚ÄúA lot of the public already thinks he‚Äôs guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,‚Äù Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ‚Äúthis kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary‚Äù to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locks himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding that the star ‚Äúmay not know all the evidence against him.‚Äù

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she‚Äôs 14. And police in Detroit were looking into a woman‚Äôs claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly‚Äôs attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ‚Äúknowingly‚Äù have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äî but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ‚Äústick to a script.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,‚Äù he said.

On Wednesday‚Äôs broadcast, Kelly‚Äôs emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ‚Äúbig heart‚Äù who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this stuff! This is not me!‚Äù He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my (expletive) life.‚Äù

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly‚Äôs finances were ‚Äúa mess.‚Äù

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äî Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äî also are set to air. Savage‚Äôs parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying on Wednesday that Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day.

Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, a day after the R&B star was jailed for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is charged with sexually abusing three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of ‚ÄúCBS This Morning.‚Äù He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse, and his voice broke as he asked, ‚ÄúHow can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can‚Äôt work?‚Äù

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had ‚Äúzero‚Äù relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, he ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly,‚Äù which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a ‚Äúsex cult.‚Äù

Experts said Kelly‚Äôs appearance was risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That‚Äôs why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

‚ÄúIn my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,‚Äù said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ‚ÄúI would document every word they said ‚Ä¶ (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.‚Äù

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ‚Äúhistorically it‚Äôs a bad idea,‚Äù Birkett said.

The nation looks destined to repeat history thanks to a media that is no longer able to objectively perform its job.

The predominantly left-leaning US media has just entered its third consecutive year of open warfare against Donald Trump. This non-stop assault risks aggravating political passions to the point where ‚ÄòTrump Derangement Syndrome‚Äô snowballs into something completely beyond our ability to control. Like full-blown Civil War.

Over the weekend, the Washington Post, one of most prominent serial producers of partisan agitation, published an article entitled, ‚ÄòIn America, talk turns to something unspoken for 150 years: Civil War‚Äô. The piece, which deftly places Democrats above the fray, opens with the following whiff of grapeshot:

‚ÄúWith the report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III reportedly nearly complete, impeachment talk in the air and the 2020 presidential election ramping up ‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs talk of violence, mayhem and, increasingly, civil war,‚Äù the Bezos-owned paper forewarned.

CNN Asks What Would Happen If Trump Refuses to Accept Defeat in 2020 https://t.co/Rw1r0TqUrz ‚Äî Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) February 24, 2019

With a level of audacity and self-righteousness that has become a trademark of the Left, not once did the article float the possibility that just maybe the mainstream media is complicit in the ongoing deterioration of political discourse, or that the Democrats are just as much to blame as the Republicans for the political fallout that now presents a grave risk to the Republic. Midnight in the Americ... Robert Bridge Best Price: $16.87 Buy New $27.80 (as of 08:00 EST - Details)

As many knowledgeable Americans will openly admit, battle lines have been drawn across the political and cultural frontier. This division is perhaps most conspicuous on social media, where friends and family who disagree with our political worldview get the ‚Äònuke option‚Äô and are effortlessly vanquished (‚Äòunfriended‚Äô) with the push of a button. This is a worrying development. The real danger will come when Americans from both sides of the political divide stop talking and start erecting electronic barriers around their political belief systems. Not even family members are spared from the tumult; just because people share the same bloodline does not automatically mean they share the same political views. America, though still green behind the ears, may understand that fact better than many other countries.

The United States has taken part in its fair share of military conflicts over the years, but its deadliest war to date has been the one that pitted Americans against each other. The so-called Civil War (1861-1865), waged between the North and South over the question of Southern secession from the Union, resulted in the death of some 620,000 soldiers from the Union and Confederate armies (and possibly as high as 850,000, according to other estimates).

Put another way, more Americans died in the Civil War than in all of the country‚Äôs other conflicts combined. For a country that has been at war for much of its existence that is a sobering fact.

With that historical footnote in mind, the mainstream media should better appreciate its responsibility for presenting an objective and balanced depiction of modern events. Yet nothing today would suggest that is the case. One need only look at the way it has blotched recent politically charged events ‚Äì like the Covington High School and Jussie Smollett scandals, not to mention the ‚ÄòRussia collusion‚Äô hoax ‚Äì to say that something is seriously out of whack inside of the Fourth Estate. The muzzled mainstream media has simply lost its mind over Donald Trump and can no longer perform its duties with any discernible amount of objectivity.

Indeed, the US leader continues to serve as a pi√±ata for the agenda-driven media, which takes daily swings at him and his administration ‚Äì and despite the fact that his popularity remains very high among voters. Only on the fringes of the media world, in the far away land of Fox News and Breitbart, will the reader find level-headed reports on the American president. This is not to suggest, of course, that Trump is beyond criticism. Not at all. There is a lot not to like about the 45th president. At the same time, however, to assume that Trump and his administration is the root of all evil, as the media would lead us to believe, is not only ridiculous, it is outright dangerous.

With no loss of irony, a good example of the media bias against Trump can be found in the very Post article that frets over the outbreak of another Civil War. While everyone knows that it takes two to tango, you would never guess that by reading this piece. In the sheltered world of the Liberal-dominated media, ‚Äòtango‚Äô is a solo event where the political right is portrayed as engaged in a dance with itself, while the political left watches ‚Äì innocuously, of course ‚Äì from the sidelines.

Michael Cohen, for example, Trump‚Äôs turncoat personal lawyer who committed perjury by lying to Congress, was quoted high in the article as saying, ‚ÄúGiven my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power.‚Äù

Now that is certainly rich. Ever since Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, Washington has been consumed by the Mueller investigation, and amid mindless chatter that Trump is an illegitimate president slated for impeachment. In other words, the last thing that can be said about the Democrats is that they facilitated a ‚Äúpeaceful transition of power.‚Äù In fact, they have hobbled Trump and his administration ever since he entered the Oval Office.

Another pro-Liberal voice dragged into the Civil War story was Robert Reich, who served on Barack Obama‚Äôs economic transition advisory board. The Post linked to an article Reich wrote last year where he posited the fictional scenario where an impeachment resolution against the president is enacted, thus kicking off mass civil strife on the direct command of dear leader. Against the State: An ... Rockwell Jr., Llewelly... Best Price: $5.02 Buy New $5.52 (as of 11:35 EST - Details)

‚ÄúTrump claims it‚Äôs the work of the ‚Äòdeep state‚Äô‚Äù, according to Reich‚Äôs febrile imagination. ‚ÄúSean Hannity of Fox News demands that every honest patriot take to the streets. Right-wing social media call for war. As insurrection spreads, Mr. Trump commands the armed forces to side with the ‚Äòpatriots.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúThe way Mr. Trump and his defenders are behaving, it‚Äôs not absurd to imagine serious social unrest,‚Äù Reich continued. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how low he‚Äôs taken us.‚Äù

Now that is some world-class chutzpah. In fact, it is the same self-righteous, ingratiating tone that weaves itself throughout the Post article. In keeping with the mainstream media‚Äôs non-stop narrative, Trump and the Republicans are blamed for everything that has gone wrong in the country, while the Democrats come off as little angels trying to piece the fractured country back together.

As already mentioned, Donald Trump is certainly not above criticism. Far from it. But for the mainstream media to place all of the blame for the current political malaise at the Republican‚Äôs door is about as responsible as lighting up a cigarette inside of a Chinese fireworks factory. The US media has an unmistakable agenda, and that is to make damn sure Trump is not reelected to another term in 2020. To that end, it has shown a devious willingness to betray all journalistic ethics and standards, which has the effect of increasing the political temperature to boiling point. It then points the finger of blame at the political right for the accumulated pile of pent-up tensions, which are ready to ignite at the first spark.

If the mainstream media continues to slavishly serve just one political master over another, it will only have itself to blame for what comes next. Its prejudiced and agenda-based reporting is a disgrace and really nothing short of a bona fide national security threat.

Kelly‚Äôs day began with a nationally televised broadcast in which he whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe him: He‚Äôd never had sex with anyone under 17 and never held anyone against her will.

The day ended with a trip to jail after the embattled R&B singer told a judge he could not pay $161,000 in back child support he owes his children‚Äôs mother.

Kelly no doubt hoped the raw interview aired Wednesday on ‚ÄúCBS This Morning‚Äù would help sway public opinion about the charges filed last month that accuse him of sexually abusing three girls and a woman. The interview was his first public defense since being charged and the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime series ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly,‚Äù which aired in January. The documentary alleged that he held women captive and ran a ‚Äúsex cult.‚Äù

But experts said his appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That‚Äôs why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù identifying two people in a still photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. Two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career.

In Kelly‚Äôs case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

‚ÄúA lot of the public already thinks he‚Äôs guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,‚Äù Thiagarajah said.

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù because of the sex-abuse allegations, he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson, who said Kelly was prepared to pay $50,000 to $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child-support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for March 13.

After his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago, Kelly spent a weekend in jail before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly‚Äôs finances were ‚Äúa mess.‚Äù

Following the court hearing, the publicist said that the singer ‚Äúfeels good‚Äù about the TV interview.

CBS said it interviewed Kelly for 80 minutes. More of the interview is expected to air Thursday.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äî Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äî will air Thursday. Savage‚Äôs parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years and asked Kelly to make her available to talk to them.

‚ÄúAt no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,‚Äù attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done ‚Äúlots of things wrong‚Äù when it comes to women, but he said he had apologized. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Rising from poverty on Chicago‚Äôs South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, ‚Äú12 Play,‚Äù which produced such popular sex-themed songs as ‚ÄúYour Body‚Äôs Callin‚Äô‚Äù and ‚ÄúBump N‚Äô Grind.‚Äù He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is ‚ÄúI Believe I Can Fly.‚Äù"

Kelly that aired on CBS this week, praise has been nearly universal for interviewer Gayle King, who remained composed as Kelly rose from his seat and lost his composure during the interview.

One Fox News host Wednesday had another bit of praise for King ‚Äî in which he confused her with someone else.

Jesse Watters, the Fox News fixture, appeared on The Five on the network Wednesday. In a discussion of the R. Kelly interview, Watters said (per a tweeted video by Yashar Ali) ‚Äúhats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco.‚Äù

However, the ‚ÄúSmollett fiasco‚Äù ‚Äî the nationally televised interview last month in which actor Jussie Smollett stuck with the story that he had actually been attacked the previous month in Chicago ‚Äî was not conducted by Gayle King. It was, in fact, Robin Roberts, as was pointed out by colleague Dana Perino, who had interviewed Smollett.

‚ÄúThat was not Gayle King,‚Äù Perino said almost immediately after Watters‚Äô faux pas.

‚ÄúI knew that,‚Äù Watters replied. He then apologized and said, ‚Äúsorry for Robin Roberts, out there.‚Äù

Robin Roberts and Gayle King have both been national television personalities for many years, although they don‚Äôt have a great deal in common with one another, except that both are African-American woman newscasters who are around the same age. The also work for different networks ‚Äî Roberts works for ABC News and King for CBS.

‚ÄúKing‚Äôs interview of Kelly has been widely praised. The morning show host maintained her composure as the R&B singer exploded in frustration and broke down in tears.‚Äù https://t.co/KQ9OCLERPE ‚Äî TheNobleJournalist (@noblejonesontv) March 7, 2019

The mistake led to a lot of mockery for Watters on social media and elsewhere, some of which brought up a previous racial incident involving the host, a 2016 segment in which he visited New York‚Äôs Chinatown and asked what were considered insensitive questions. The segment was denounced at the time as ‚Äúrude, offensive, mocking, derogatory and damaging‚Äù by the Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA), per Variety.

The King/Roberts mix-up, meanwhile, brought in a fresh round of condemnation. The website The Root described Watters as the ‚Äúliving embodiment of what a mayonnaise dream deferred would look and act like if it angrily humped a very smug dab of expired bronzer,‚Äù and as ‚Äúa dude who looks like a guy who wanted to be better at sports than he actually was.‚Äù

Roberts spoke this week about the Smollett interview, after the actor was charged with filing a false police report. Per Page Six, the Good Morning America host said that she had been reluctant to do the interview, but defended doing so, on the grounds that the interview was newsworthy."

Had all of these so-called ‚Äújournalists‚Äù who believed Smollett without verifying any of his wild claims actually looked into the matter, they would have realized that Smollett had previously sent himself a fake racist letter, which failed to gain the level of publicity that he had hoped.

Upset that this fake letter didn‚Äôt achieve for himself the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù status that he was aiming for, Smollett then paid his two Nigerian buddies $3,500 each to ‚Äúlynch‚Äù him as he left a Chicago Subway restaurant at 2 a.m., sandwich in hand. Smollett then, as the world is now fully aware, proceeded to blame this fake ‚Äúlynching‚Äù on Trump supporters whom he falsely claimed were wearing ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù hats.

‚ÄúWhen the letter didn‚Äôt get enough attention, [Smollett] concocted the staged attack,‚Äù a corroborated source told CBS 2 investigator Brad Edwards.

President Trump is right: Fake news is a bigger problem than anyone could have imagined

All these mainstream media hacks needed to do to either verify or debunk Smollett‚Äôs claims was to contact Chicago‚Äôs Cinespace Studios, where Smollett‚Äôs Empire show is filmed, to determine the source of the fake racist letter that Smollett says was sent to him, along with a ‚Äúwhite substance‚Äù that later turned out to be ground-up aspirin.

Had they done this, they could have easily put two and two together and determined that Smollett was the source of both the letter and the ‚Äúattack,‚Äù his motive being to victimize himself for 15 minutes of fame. But instead, they gobbled down and digested Smollett‚Äôs fictitious claims, and spread them around as reality.

It‚Äôs the reason why increasingly fewer Americans trust anything they see or hear on the ‚Äúnews,‚Äù because very little of this ‚Äúnews‚Äù is actually real. Once-trusted news outlets like The Washington Post have once again proven that they are unable or unwilling to fact-check anything anymore, especially when it paints President Trump and everyone who supports him in a negative light.

Another glaring piece of evidence against Smollett‚Äôs made-up story about being attacked that the mainstream media completely ignored was a play he had just read for entitled, ‚ÄúTake Me Out.‚Äù This play features a gay character who is attacked using ‚Äúthe same racial slurs Smollett told police his attackers screamed at him, including ‚Äòf****t‚Äô and ‚Äòn****r.'‚Äù

In other words, Smollett ripped the subject matter straight from ‚ÄúTake Me Out‚Äù and used it to make up his own story about being attacked, which the mainstream media then parroted without fact-checking any of it. And chances are Smollett will continue this charade, even though he‚Äôs now been exposed and publicly shamed, claiming that he‚Äôs still somehow a victim in all of this.

‚ÄúOnce Smollett is charged, he will almost certainly try to play the ‚Äòsympathy race card‚Äô by publicly confessing to staging the whole thing,‚Äù says Mike Adams, the Health Ranger. ‚ÄúImportantly, this public confession will be paired with a tripling down on self-victimization: Smollett, I predict, will blame Trump for ‚Äòmaking me do it.'‚Äù

‚ÄúVictimology is now the specialty of the deranged, delusional Left. These are people who don‚Äôt know how to create economic abundance, run a business in a sustainable way or produce anything of value for society. Instead, they become experts in victimhood, and they play the victim card to its fullest,‚Äù Adams adds.

Kelly interview that aired on CBS This Morning. During the interview, Kelly lashed out dramatically at his interviewer, Gayle King, screaming and pounding his fists, as she asked him pointed questions about the sexual abuse allegations he is currently facing, and those he has faced in the past.

Through the entire encounter, King remained calm in the face of rage and the possibility of physical harm - leaving viewers in awe of her composure.

It didn't go unnoticed at Fox. But the moment was short-lived when it became clear Jesse Watters didn't know which interviewer he was praising.

Here's the exchange on The Five:

Jesse Watters: Hats off to Gayle King, for totally redeeming herself after the [Jussie] Smollett fiasco.

Juan Williams: Janet, I, you know...

Dana Perino: That was not Gayle King.

Watters: Oh. I knew that.

[laughter]

Perino: Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview.

Williams: One of the things that I think lots of people...

Watters: Sorry for Robin Roberts out there.

[laughter]

Williams: Go right ahead, Jesse. It's cool.

Watters: I apologize.

Robin Roberts faced criticism after her interview with Jussie Smollett on Feb. 14 about the alleged hate crime committed against him. The interview aired on ABC's Good Morning America in the final days prior to his arrest for filing a false police report.

The interview was Smollett's first detailed public account of the alleged attack.

""I will never be the man that this did not happen to,"" he told Roberts. ""I am forever changed,""

At the time, police said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was assaulted around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two ""unknown offenders"" who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on the actor and wrapped a rope around his neck.

One day after the interview aired, police announced they had interviewed two persons of interest who had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation."" On Feb. 21, Smollett was arrested and charged with falsifying a police report. Police said he concocted the story of a hate crime because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"" for his work on ""Empire,"" and that he paid the two men $3,500 to stage the attack after the threatening letter - which police suspect Smollett sent to himself at the Cinespace Chicago Film Studios - failed to attract attention.

Roberts later spoke about the hesitation she felt before that interview, noting she had doubts as to whether she should do it in the first place.

Roberts called her position a ""no-win"" situation.

Kelly‚Äôs day began with a nationally televised broadcast in which he whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe him: He‚Äôd never had sex with anyone under 17 and never held anyone against her will.

The day ended with a trip to jail after the embattled R&B singer told a judge he could not pay $161,000 in back child support he owes his children‚Äôs mother.

Kelly no doubt hoped the raw interview aired Wednesday on ‚ÄúCBS This Morning‚Äù would help sway public opinion about the charges filed last month that accuse him of sexually abusing three girls and a woman. The interview was his first public defense since being charged and the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime series ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly,‚Äù which aired in January. The documentary alleged that he held women captive and ran a ‚Äúsex cult.‚Äù

But experts said his appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That‚Äôs why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

‚ÄúIn my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,‚Äù said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ‚ÄúI would document every word they said ‚Ä¶ (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.‚Äù

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but, Birkett said, ‚Äúhistorically it‚Äôs a bad idea.‚Äù

One recent example was ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù identifying two people in a still photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. Two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career.

In Kelly‚Äôs case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

‚ÄúA lot of the public already thinks he‚Äôs guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,‚Äù Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ‚Äúthis kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary‚Äù to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said. ‚ÄúHe may not know all the evidence against him.‚Äù

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15, and a videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she‚Äôs 14. Kelly‚Äôs attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ‚Äúknowingly‚Äù have sex with underage girls.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äî but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ‚Äústick to a script.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,‚Äù he said.

On Wednesday‚Äôs broadcast, Kelly‚Äôs emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ‚Äúbig heart‚Äù who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this stuff! This is not me!‚Äù He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my (expletive) life.‚Äù

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù because of the sex-abuse allegations, he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson, who said Kelly was prepared to pay $50,000 to $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child-support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for March 13.

After his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago, Kelly spent a weekend in jail before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly‚Äôs finances were ‚Äúa mess.‚Äù

Following the court hearing, the publicist said that the singer ‚Äúfeels good‚Äù about the TV interview.

CBS said it interviewed Kelly for 80 minutes. More of the interview is expected to air Thursday.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äî Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äî will air Thursday. Savage‚Äôs parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years and asked Kelly to make her available to talk to them.

‚ÄúAt no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,‚Äù attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done ‚Äúlots of things wrong‚Äù when it comes to women, but he said he had apologized. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Rising from poverty on Chicago‚Äôs South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, ‚Äú12 Play,‚Äù which produced such popular sex-themed songs as ‚ÄúYour Body‚Äôs Callin‚Äô‚Äù and ‚ÄúBump N‚Äô Grind.‚Äù He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is ‚ÄúI Believe I Can Fly.‚Äù

This story has been corrected to show that interviews with two women who live with Kelly will air Thursday, not Friday.

The 'Empire' actor has been charged with filing a false police report after claiming he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in January and after he denied staging the assault, the 48-year-old rapper-and-actress has insisted she will continue to support him until someone can provide ""definitive proof"" the incident was a hoax

7 March 2019

She said: ""The guy I've seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who's very kind and who's always been cool and sweet.



""And that's just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof - which I haven't seen yet - then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.""



But the 'STAR' actress admitted she doesn't ""know what to make"" of the scandal, but she hopes everything works out eventually.



Speaking to Zainab Salbi on Yahoo News' 'Through Her Eyes', she added: ""I don't even know what to make of it.



""All I know is that I hope everything works out in the end and everybody basically comes out unscathed.""



Following Jussie's arrest, it was revealed his character, Jamal Lyon, would be written out of the final two episodes of season five of 'Empire' to prevent further ""disruption"" to filming.



Producers including Lee Daniels and Danny Strong said in a statement last month: ""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our 'Empire' family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.



""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.



""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""



The 36-year-old actor has been praised by his legal team as a ""young man of impeccable character"" in a statement that hit out at the way the investigation has been handled.



The lawyers said in a statement: ""Today we witnessed an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.



""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.



""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.""

Yesterday, at Ricochet, Bethany Mandel noted that ‚ÄúThe Woke Always Eat Their Own,‚Äù linking to an item that was promoted to the top of Twitter by their management concerning SJWs grousing about Smith being cast to play Serena and Venus Williams‚Äô father in an upcoming biopic, because ‚Äúsome people [were] questioning the decision for Smith to play a darker-skinned man.‚Äù As Mandel adds:

When you click on the story, the objections appear to just be from a handful accounts, and none of them notable. That hasn‚Äôt stopped Twitter from elevating their complaints to the mainstream, granting them undeserved legitimacy. The purpose is for clicks, for engagement, for conversation on Twitter about the topic. It‚Äôs their business model, and you can‚Äôt fault them for trying to initiate a conversation. The problem is, Twitter (and its ultra-liberal Silicon Valley engineers) are willing to let the enemy of the good be the enemy of the perfect; stoking race wars within the black community in order to do it.

Twitter is the spawning place for lots of what Mickey Kaus calls ‚Äúthe undernews,‚Äù much of which never is touched by the MSM. But how quickly did this non-story emerge from the undernews to the overculture? This fast, as spotted by Power Line‚Äôs Steve Hayward today:

You might think this was limited to the crazed Twitterati, but in fact the ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù made it to the BBC, which demonstrates once again the ‚ÄúBeebs‚Äù atrocious news judgment: Will Smith ‚Äòcasting as Richard Williams‚Äô sparks colourism debate Richard Williams, 77, coached his daughters to become two of the world‚Äôs greatest tennis players, despite having no previous experience of the game. But Smith‚Äôs reported casting in the film has angered critics, who say he is too light-skinned for the part. Colourism is a form of discrimination against dark-skinned people in favour of those with lighter skin from the same race.

‚ÄúAs someone pointed out in the aftermath of Jussie Smollett hoax,‚Äù Hayward writes, ‚Äúthe demand for racism now exceeds the supply, so we have to resort to made-up racism to satisfy the demand for leftists to feel outraged and indignant.‚Äù

Obviously though, there‚Äôs a simple solution to this dust-up. There‚Äôs only person qualified to play the pater familias of the Williams family: Scarlett Johansson."

Some righties found the whole thing suspicious, accusing Corn of having invented the story for attention. Not me. If you were going to fabricate an ominous Tale From Trump‚Äôs America, you wouldn‚Äôt choose an offense that‚Äôs so trivial and the story wouldn‚Äôt place you on the can while it played out. This smacks of a guy who was tired, not thinking clearly, and inclined to overshare about a perfectly mundane experience he‚Äôd had ‚Äî the coin of the realm in Twitter-land ‚Äî rather than a two-bit Jussie Smollett. Plus, he has photos ‚Äî sort of.

I didn‚Äôt want to post a pic of the graffiti because that would be spreading the work of a deplorable. But here‚Äôs a pic showing where it occurred with the message blacked out. No doubt, disbelieving conservatives will still call this a Deep State plot. Oh well. pic.twitter.com/PEBf8p3hC4 ‚Äî David Corn (@DavidCornDC) March 6, 2019

Corn making the whole thing up for easy retweets would be far less weird, frankly, than him observing some men‚Äôs room graffiti and thinking ‚ÄúThe world needs to know about this‚Äù while snapping pictures.

Your exit question: What made this newsworthy in his mind? If the graffiti had been about Nikki Haley, would it still have warranted comment?"

‚ÄúHats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco,‚Äù Watters said. The host was referring to Roberts‚Äô interview with actor Jussie Smollett, who is accused of filing a false police report about an alleged attack against him. Since the mid-February interview, Roberts has discussed her apprehension about conducting the sit-down in the first place, saying that it was a ‚Äúno-win situation‚Äù for her.

‚ÄúThat was not Gayle King,‚Äù co-host Dana Perino interjected after Watters‚Äô statement.

‚ÄúOh, I knew that,‚Äù Watters said, smiling.

‚ÄúRobin Roberts did the interview,‚Äù she continued. Co-hosts around the table laughed.

‚ÄúRobin Roberts,‚Äù Watters said. ‚ÄúSorry for Robin Roberts out there. I apologize.‚Äù

The Fox News host apologized again later on in the show, writing on a small dry-erase board, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Gayle & Robin.‚Äù

King‚Äôs interview of Kelly has been widely praised. The morning show host maintained her composure as the R&B singer exploded in frustration and broke down in tears."

Kelly‚Äôs day began with a nationally televised broadcast in which he whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe him: He‚Äôd never had sex with anyone under 17 and never held anyone against her will.

The day ended with a trip to jail after the embattled R&B singer told a judge he could not pay $161,000 in back child support he owes his children‚Äôs mother.

Kelly no doubt hoped the raw interview aired Wednesday on ‚ÄúCBS This Morning‚Äù would help sway public opinion about the charges filed last month that accuse him of sexually abusing three girls and a woman. The interview was his first public defense since being charged and the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime series ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly,‚Äù which aired in January. The documentary alleged that he held women captive and ran a ‚Äúsex cult.‚Äù

But experts said his appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That‚Äôs why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

‚ÄúIn my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,‚Äù said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ‚ÄúI would document every word they said ‚Ä¶ (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.‚Äù

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but, Birkett said, ‚Äúhistorically it‚Äôs a bad idea.‚Äù

One recent example was ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù identifying two people in a still photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. Two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career.

In Kelly‚Äôs case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

‚ÄúA lot of the public already thinks he‚Äôs guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,‚Äù Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ‚Äúthis kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary‚Äù to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said. ‚ÄúHe may not know all the evidence against him.‚Äù

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15, and a videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she‚Äôs 14. Kelly‚Äôs attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ‚Äúknowingly‚Äù have sex with underage girls.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äì but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ‚Äústick to a script.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,‚Äù he said.

On Wednesday‚Äôs broadcast, Kelly‚Äôs emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ‚Äúbig heart‚Äù who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this stuff! This is not me!‚Äù He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my (expletive) life.‚Äù

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it,‚Äù because of the sex-abuse allegations,‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson, who said Kelly was prepared to pay $50,000 to $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child-support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for March 13.

After his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago, Kelly spent a weekend in jail before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly‚Äôs finances were ‚Äúa mess.‚Äù

Following the court hearing, the publicist said that the singer ‚Äúfeels good‚Äù about the TV interview.

CBS said it interviewed Kelly for 80 minutes. More of the interview is expected to air Thursday.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äì Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äì will air Friday. Savage‚Äôs parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years and asked Kelly to make her available to talk to them.

‚ÄúAt no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,‚Äù attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done ‚Äúlots of things wrong‚Äù when it comes to women, but he said he had apologized. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Rising from poverty on Chicago‚Äôs South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, ‚Äú12 Play,‚Äù which produced such popular sex-themed songs as ‚ÄúYour Body‚Äôs Callin'‚Äù and ‚ÄúBump N‚Äô Grind.‚Äù He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is ‚ÄúI Believe I Can Fly.‚Äù

Kelly interview that aired on CBS This Morning. During the interview, Kelly lashed out dramatically at his interviewer, Gayle King, screaming and pounding his fists, as she asked him pointed questions about the sexual abuse allegations he is currently facing, and those he has faced in the past.

Through the entire encounter, King remained calm in the face of rage and the possibility of physical harm - leaving viewers in awe of her composure.

It didn't go unnoticed at Fox. But the moment was short-lived when it became clear Jesse Watters didn't know which interviewer he was praising.

Here's the exchange on The Five:

Jesse Watters: Hats off to Gayle King, for totally redeeming herself after the [Jussie] Smollett fiasco.

Juan Williams: Janet, I, you know...

Dana Perino: That was not Gayle King.

Watters: Oh. I knew that.

[laughter]

Perino: Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview.

Williams: One of the things that I think lots of people...

Watters: Sorry for Robin Roberts out there.

[laughter]

Williams: Go right ahead, Jesse. It's cool.

Watters: I apologize.

Robin Roberts faced criticism after her interview with Jussie Smollett on Feb. 14 about the alleged hate crime committed against him. The interview aired on ABC's Good Morning America in the final days prior to his arrest for filing a false police report.

The interview was Smollett's first detailed public account of the alleged attack.

""I will never be the man that this did not happen to,"" he told Roberts. ""I am forever changed,""

At the time, police said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was assaulted around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two ""unknown offenders"" who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on the actor and wrapped a rope around his neck.

One day after the interview aired, police announced they had interviewed two persons of interest who had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation."" On Feb. 21, Smollett was arrested and charged with falsifying a police report. Police said he concocted the story of a hate crime because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"" for his work on ""Empire,"" and that he paid the two men $3,500 to stage the attack after the threatening letter - which police suspect Smollett sent to himself at the Cinespace Chicago Film Studios - failed to attract attention.

Roberts later spoke about the hesitation she felt before that interview, noting she had doubts as to whether she should do it in the first place.

Roberts called her position a ""no-win"" situation.

During a recent interview with Zainab Salbi, Latifah explained why she refuses to turn her back on Smollett, despite the reports that the actor staged his own hate crime earlier this year in Chicago.

""Until somebody can show me some proof otherwise, I'm going with him,"" Latifah said on Yahoo News' Through Her Eyes series. ""Because the guy I've seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, whose very kind and whose always cool and sweet, that's the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof, which I haven't seen yet, then, you know, I gotta go with him.""

On Jan. 29, Smollett told police two masked men had attacked him on Chicago streets earlier that day. The 36-year-old actor claimed the men beat him, placed a noose around his neck, and poured a chemical substance on him before shouting, ""This is MAGA country""‚Äîa reference to President Donald Trump's controversial ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Officers initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime, but upon further digging, the Chicago Police concluded Smollett had orchestrated his alleged attack with the help of Abel and Ola Osundairo.

""[...] Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud in the process,"" Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson said during a press conference last month. ""And why? The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary. So he concocted a story about being attacked.""

The actor was eventually arrested on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false report; however, Smollett's legal team has denied the allegations on their client's behalf.

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,"" his legal team wrote in a statement. ""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.""

Smollett is now out on $100,000 bond, and is due back in court March 14.

In wake of the scandal, many celebrities have condemned the actor for carrying out the alleged hoax. Empire executives‚ÄîLee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo, and Dennis Hammer‚Äîalso announced that Smollett's role will be cut from the final two episodes of the current season; however, Entertainment Tonight has reported that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, will appear in the March 13 episode.

Though the outlet does not specify where it got this information, the report cites the episode synopsis: ""Jamal and Kai try to figure out where they stand and a mystery begins to unravel.""

It's important to note that the current season premiered this past September, and that the description for next week's episode was likely written before Smollett's arrest."

Kelly‚Äôs day began with a nationally televised broadcast in which he whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe him: He‚Äôd never had sex with anyone under 17 and never held anyone against her will.

The day ended with a trip to jail after the embattled R&B singer told a judge he could not pay $161,000 in back child support he owes his children‚Äôs mother.

Kelly no doubt hoped the raw interview aired Wednesday on ‚ÄúCBS This Morning‚Äù would help sway public opinion about the charges filed last month that accuse him of sexually abusing four women, including three who were underage. The interview was his first public defense since being charged and the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime series ‚ÄúSurviving R. Kelly,‚Äù which aired in January. The documentary alleged that he held women against their will and ran a ‚Äúsex cult.‚Äù

But experts said his appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That‚Äôs why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

‚ÄúIn my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,‚Äù said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ‚ÄúI would document every word they said ‚Ä¶ (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.‚Äù

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but, Birkett said, ‚Äúhistorically it‚Äôs a bad idea.‚Äù

One recent example was ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù identifying two people in a still photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. Two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career.

In Kelly‚Äôs case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

‚ÄúA lot of the public already thinks he‚Äôs guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,‚Äù Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ‚Äúthis kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary‚Äù to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said. ‚ÄúHe may not know all the evidence against him.‚Äù

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15, and a videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she‚Äôs 14. Kelly‚Äôs attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ‚Äúknowingly‚Äù have sex with underage girls.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview ‚Äì but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ‚Äústick to a script.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,‚Äù he said.

Even Kelly‚Äôs attorney has been critical of letting defendants speak publicly.

On Wednesday‚Äôs broadcast, Kelly‚Äôs emotions swung wildly as he explained he simply was someone with a ‚Äúbig heart‚Äù who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, Kelly angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this stuff! This is not me!‚Äù He cried as he hit his hands together, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting for my (expletive) life.‚Äù

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ‚Äúnot about music.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can‚Äôt do it,‚Äù because of the sex-abuse allegations,‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúYou all just don‚Äôt want to believe it.‚Äù

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ‚Äúexpecting to leave. He didn‚Äôt come here to go to jail,‚Äù said his publicist, Darryll Johnson, who said Kelly was prepared to pay $50,000 to $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays $161,000 in back child support. His next hearing was scheduled for March 13.

The publicist said after the court hearing that the singer ‚Äúfeels good‚Äù about the TV interview.

CBS said it interviewed Kelly for 80 minutes. More of the interview is expected to air Thursday.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly ‚Äì Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary ‚Äì will air Friday. Savage‚Äôs parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years and asked Kelly to make her available to talk to them.

‚ÄúAt no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,‚Äù attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly, who had been free on bail following his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago, acknowledged in the interview that he had done ‚Äúlots of things wrong‚Äù when it comes to women But he said he had apologized and denied doing anything against their will. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

It didn‚Äôt go unnoticed at Fox. But the moment was short-lived when it became clear Jesse Watters didn‚Äôt know which interviewer he was praising.

Here‚Äôs the exchange on ‚ÄúThe Five‚Äù:

AD

Jesse Watters: Hats off to Gayle King, for totally redeeming herself after the [Jussie] Smollett fiasco.

Juan Williams: Janet, I, you know...

AD

Dana Perino: That was not Gayle King.

Watters: Oh. I knew that.

[laughter]

Perino: Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview.

Williams: One of the things that I think lots of people...

Watters: Sorry for Robin Roberts out there.

[laughter]

Williams: Go right ahead, Jesse. It‚Äôs cool.

Watters: I apologize.

Watters apologized a second time later in the show with a note on a whiteboard, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Gayle + Robin.‚Äù

The network also apologized swiftly in August when it mistook singer Patti LaBelle for Aretha Franklin as part of the network‚Äôs obituary for Franklin. As The Washington Post‚Äôs Sean Sullivan reported at the time, ‚Äúthe flub was made all the more ironic by the fact that Franklin and LaBelle reportedly had a long-standing feud that only ended on Thursday morning when the 76-year-old legendary diva passed away.‚Äù

Robin Roberts faced criticism after her interview with Jussie Smollett on Feb. 14 about the alleged hate crime committed against him in Chicago. The interview aired on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù days before he was arrested and accused of filing a false police report.

The interview was Smollett‚Äôs first detailed public account of the alleged attack.

‚ÄúI will never be the man that this did not happen to,"" he told Roberts. ""I am forever changed,‚Äù

At the time, police said Smollett, who is black and gay, was assaulted around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two ‚Äúunknown offenders‚Äù who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on the actor and wrapped a rope around his neck.

AD

One day after the interview aired, police announced they had interviewed two persons of interest who had ‚Äúshifted the trajectory of the investigation."" On Feb. 21, Smollett was arrested and charged with falsifying a police report. Police said he concocted the story of a hate crime because he was ‚Äúdissatisfied with his salary‚Äù for his work on ‚ÄúEmpire,‚Äù and that he paid the two men $3,500 to stage the attack after the threatening letter ‚Äî which police suspect Smollett sent to himself at the Cinespace Chicago Film Studios ‚Äî failed to attract attention.

Roberts later spoke about the hesitation she felt before that interview, noting she had doubts as to whether she should do it in the first place.

Roberts called her position a ‚Äúno-win‚Äù situation.

Jesse Watters, living embodiment of what a mayonnaise dream deferred would look and act like if it angrily humped a very smug dab of expired bronzer, is an idiot.

This has not stopped him from having a too-long and, I guarantee, too-lucrative career at Fox News, where his sole function is to continue being an idiot.

Some time Wednesday afternoon on the Fox show he co-hosts, Watters unleashed the full, dazzling breadth of his punditry: which is to get things all the way wrong while simultaneously being a touch racist. Discussing singer R. Kelly‚Äôs recent sit-down with CBS reporter Gayle King, Watters said:

‚ÄúHe was acting like a child, throwing a tantrum and acting like he was the victim. Like, ‚Äòyou‚Äôre doing this to me,‚Äô and taking no responsibility for himself. I agree, hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the [Jussie] Smollett fiasco,‚Äù Watters said, turning to his co-hosts.

‚ÄúThat was not Gayle King,‚Äù Dana Perino, suddenly the voice of reason, responded.

‚ÄúOh. I knew that,‚Äù Watters responded.

‚ÄúRobin Roberts did the Smollett interview,‚Äù Perino said ‚Äîagain, somehow the voice of reason‚Äîor at the very least, the voice of being able to tell two black women journalists apart .

Roberts admitted to not being sure if she wanted to do the interview at first, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be completely honest, I was like I don‚Äôt know if I want to do the interview or not. I said I don‚Äôt want to sit down with him if he is going to lawyer up. And then I was told, he wants to speak with you because he is outraged by people making assumptions about whether it happened or not.‚Äù

Roberts said that she agreed to the interview because it was a newsworthy story and she was getting the first interview,

‚ÄúThey say, he wants to say things that he has not said and I‚Äôm like, As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he is going on record for the first time, yes I‚Äôll do the interview.‚Äù

Roberts said that she was allowed to press and challenge Smollett on details that were not clear with his story. ‚ÄúI sat down with him and I don‚Äôt know what he is going to say she said. Following up about how he couldn‚Äôt believe people didn‚Äôt believe him well go, You‚Äôre out 2 o clock in the morning, you‚Äôre getting a sandwich, and you won‚Äôt give up your phone.‚Äù

Roberts also said that she tried to be fair due to her ties with African Americans and the LGBT community.

‚ÄúI am a black gay woman. He is a black gay man. He‚Äôs saying that there is a hate crime so if I am too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, you don‚Äôt believe a brother. If I‚Äôm too light on him, it‚Äôs like because you‚Äôre in the community you are giving him a pass. It was a no-win situation for me.‚Äù

Smollett turned himself in one week after the brothers came forward saying the attack was planned. He is now facing disorderly conduct charges for filing a false police report. He is due back in court March 14"
