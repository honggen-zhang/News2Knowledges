Members of the Queer and Trans Faculty and Staff group including Erin Mahoney, Advocacy Chair (top, second from the left) pose for a group picture after spending time the QTFAS Luncheon Wednesday Feb. 6. QTFAS use the monthly lunches to foster a sense of community among queer faculty members at Sac State.

Even on a campus as large as Sacramento State, it’s easy to feel alone, and that is what makes it important to have a group of peers to connect with.

For some Sac State faculty, that group of peers is the Queer and Trans Faculty and Staff group on campus.

“There was already enough fear in my life, it was nice to know that there was a community of peers,” said Ántonia Peigahi, education librarian and faculty senate chair.

QTFAS, which has been meeting since December 2017, had its first BYO-Lunch event of the semester on Wednesday, and hopes to continue having such events regularly.

“There was a desire to create a place where faculty and staff could get together and get to know each other,” said Chris Kent, academic advisor and membership/outreach chair for QTFAS.

Several QTFAS members expressed that their group gave them a sense of community, and though they often echoed each other they are still very much a new group.

“It’s important to recognize part of our lives as LGBTQ doesn’t have to be separate from our professional lives and in fact it shouldn’t,” said Erin Mahoney, administrative support coordinator for the College of Arts & Letters and Advocacy Chair for QTFAS.

QTFAS held its first board meeting of the semester on February 1, focusing on the importance of creating a unified voice.

The need for a unified voice came when QTFAS board members questioned how to respond to events in the news such as the hate crimes committed against Jussie Smollett.

Many members of the board were unsure of how, or even if, they should respond to events in the news since there are no current guiding principles for how the QTFAS board should respond to news and what values it should uphold in such responses.

“I think as a board, we would be exhausted as hell if we responded to everything,” Kent said at the meeting.

The board ultimately decided that they needed a larger document which would explain what QTFAS stood for and when it should respond to news events. Future meetings are planned to create this document as well as a website where it will be found.

QTFAS meets for its BYO-lunch events the first Wednesday of the month and maintains a Facebook and Instagram.

“People are welcome to join us,” Mahoney said."

Behind the Scenes, It’s Clear Chicago Media and Police Doubt Jussie Smollett’s Story

I can’t recall a large crime story where there was a bigger gap between what the police and media are saying publicly, and what they expressing behind the scenes, than the saga involving the recent alleged hate crimeagainst actor Jussie Smollett. Similarly, there may not be a story where you can tell more by what has not happened, in comparison to what actually has occurred

It’s all going to leak. Chicago PD is not known for its love of gays, blacks, or gay blacks. Especially when one such is attempting to manipulate them in a gigantic publicity stunt.

The current public stance of the Chicago police is that earlier this month, at 2 a.m. on a very cold Chicago night, Smollett was the victim of what appears to be a heinous hate crime where he was physically attacked by two men, and humiliated due to his race, homosexuality, and possibly his opposition to President Donald Trump. The Chicago media, in official reports, has largely treated that narrative as legitimate, while chronicling the complete lack of suspects and corroborating evidence as more of a frustration than any indication that something else might be going on here.

Um…Democrat city administration in charge of PD, and Democrat media stenographers staffing the repoorting desks at the major media outlets.

Behind the scenes, however, based on conversations I have had with multiple people covering the story, there is a radically different take on what really did happen to Smollett. In short, there is near unanimity among police sources that Smollett’s story is very likely not true. And that even the media outlets still regurgitating the current “party line” don’t really believe it.

At which point some might ask, “In that case, why are they reporting it as if they do believe it?” Of course, that would be an incredibly naive question.

In my experience, most people are very bad at reading the tea leaves in these types of situations, and it often leads to very inaccurate interpretations of what is really going on. This case has several important elements which, if you know what to look for, make evaluating the actions of the police and news media really rather easy.

With honest, accurate reporting, you shouldn’t have to “read tea leaves,” or read between the lines, or be able to read reporters’ minds in order to figure out what is actually going on. Operative would is “shouldn’t.” Using it betrays more incredible naivete, unfortunately.

The first thing you need to understand about this situation is that, because of Smollett’s persona and the nature of his allegation, no one in law enforcement or the news media wants any part of publicly questioning his story. Everyone knows that if they make any sort of negative implication against a black, gay, liberal, celebrity, victim of a horrible hate crime, that they will be roundly and severely attacked, regardless of whether they turn out to be correct. As a conservative, I look at this as his Political Correctness Force Field. Smollett’s protection here is literally about as strong as it gets, especially in Chicago, a city that has a large black population and is extremely liberal.

It may not be quite as strong among Chicago’s actual Black populations, which is not especially known for LGBTQ friendliness or toleration. But they, of course, don’t matter. What and who does matter is the silk-stocking crowd from the Gold Coast on north, which is mostly white, and rabidly liberal, and who love themselves some beat-up black gay TV celebrities.

So, in this hyper-sensitive media environment, any sort of deviation from the accepted storyline by the police or the news media, much like if your seven-year-old kid is showing subtle signs they no longer believe in Santa Claus, must be given exponentially greater significance than it normally would. Here, both the police and news media in Chicago have provided plenty of those types of veiled indications, both publicly and privately.

Yes, they most certainly have. The lack of a stampede to judgement is most telling.

Among other things, the police have made it very clear they have not yet found any proof of an attack, despite having almost all of Smollett’s movements on surveillance video. They have disclosed that Smollett would not give over his cell phone to verify his timeline of events. They even published photos of “persons of interest” that they had to know were going to be universally mocked for being obviously irrelevant. In my view, none of those important revelations would have been made public in the way that they were, unless there was extreme suspicion within the police force that Smollett’s story was not fully accurate. By extension, media figures would not be being told by their police sources, as I have been told is currently happening both routinely and with vigor, that the authorities are acting on the assumption that they will never find any evidence to fully substantiate Smollett’s story. This isn’t just happening via idle speculation either, the police are doing so with great specificity, even including an alternative theory for what really happened (current attempts to find the origin of the rope found around Smollett’s neck long after the event was over are believed to be the most likely game-changer, if there ever is one in this case). As for the Chicago media, a couple of local television reporters are apparently using Twitter as a confessional for information about the case that their stations currently fear to air. Rob Elgas of the Chicago ABC affiliate, and Rafer Weigel of the Fox station (which carries Smollett’s show Empire) have continually updated the developments, or lack thereof, in a way that paints a much different picture from the one that viewers would see on an actual newscast.

Okay, that’s enough. You should be following Weigel’s Twitter feed, if nothing else, for the freshest updates on Smollett’s ludicrous false flag publicity scam.

My personal hunch is that the Chicago PD will come up with video of either Smollett or somebody close to him buying the rope for his fake noose. At which point the left will lose all interest in poor Jussie. Especially the leftist media, which is most of it."

Page’s criticism came after Pratt appeared on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and talked about being religious and completing a 21-day fast inspired by the Biblical Prophet Daniel. “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part” actor frequently attends Zoe Church, which is modeled after Hillsong Church, a megachurch founded in Australia but which has locations in New York City and Los Angeles, the New York Times previously reported. Variety stated Pratt was also a Hillsong church attendee.

Following Pratt’s appearance on the late-night show, Page took to Twitter to criticize Pratt for attending the church, which she did not name.

“Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too?” She tweeted along with a Hollywood Reporter article about Pratt’s interview.

On Saturday Page, who came out as gay during a 2014 speech in Las Vegas at a conference for the Human Rights Campaign, doubled down on her comment against Pratt and said the actor should “try and listen” to the LGBTQ community.

“If you are a famous actor and you belong to an organization that hates a certain group of people, don’t be surprised if someone simply wonders why it’s not addressed,” the 31-year-old actress tweeted Saturday. “Being anti LGBTQ is wrong, there aren’t two sides. The damage it causes is severe. Full stop. Sending love to all.”

She said in another tweet, “If lgbtq+ people are expressing their pain, their trauma, their experiences … maybe just try and listen? Open your heart, stop being defensive and have compassion. It’s a beautiful and life changing feeling, empathy. Much love truly to all.”

Pastor Chad Veach previously told the New York Times he modeled Zoe church after Hillsong, which is popular among celebrities, including Justin Bieber.

Senior pastor Brian Houston at Hillsong previously said in a 2015 statement that the church does “not affirm a gay lifestyle.”

“We do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid,” he said in a post on the church’s website. “I recognize this one statement alone is upsetting to people on both sides of this discussion, which points to the complexity of the issue for churches all over the world.”

He said that he loves and accepts “people on a personal level.”

“Everyone is welcome at Hillsong church except for known predators, those who are disruptive, or those who have adversarial agendas,” he said, adding that gay people are welcomed at the church but cannot pursue a leadership role.

LOS ANGELES TIMES/TNS

JOHN LAMPARSKI/WIREIMAGE/GETTY IMAGES/TNS

“Empire’’ actor Jussie Smollett is shown in May 2018 at a Fox Network event in New York City.

WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. – “I’m OK.”

That was the first thing Jussie Smollett told the sold-out Troubadour in West Hollywood on Feb. 2 when he walked onstage.

The show was the R&B singer and “Empire” actor’s first public appearance since he reported to Chicago police a vicious attack that authorities are investigating as a possible hate crime.

“I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to,” Smollett said, fighting back tears as he addressed the crowd. “I’m gonna stand strong with y’all. I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let those (attackers) win. I will always stand for love.”

Black, gay, artistic

With that, the room burst into cheers, and Smollett took his voice back.

Family, friends and fans in the audience were profoundly moved by Smollett’s resilience in performing just days after the incident, in which two people allegedly approached the 36-year old actor and musician while

yelling racist and homophobic slurs.

Before Smollett took the stage, his siblings surrounded the microphone to give a brief statement, where Joel Smollett Jr. said, “As his big brother, I wanted Jussie to sit this one out … but tonight is an important part of Jussie’s healing. He’s been a fighter since he was a baby … But above all else, he is the epitome of love.”

In the audience, many fans said they felt a personal obligation to be there and stand up for Smollett and the communities — Black, gay, artistic — that he represents.

‘Five steps back’

The news of the assault “was gut-wrenching to hear, in this day and age.

It was a sobering reminder of hate,” said Carrington Bester of Los Angeles. “It was important to be here to support him. This speaks to his integrity and commitment to his art.”

Jametta Bailey-Hailey, who traveled from Springfield, Massachusetts for the show, said, “I called my mother and literally cried” after hearing news of the attack. For every step forward in the fight against racism and homophobia, Bailey-Hailey said, “it’s like we’re walking five steps back.”

But, Bailey-Hailey added, Smollett’s grit and commitment to music was a glimmer of hope.

“We stand with him, nothing’s going to stop him.” Smollett looked determined not to let the attack define his performance.

Lyrical messages

He did open with a cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Love’s in Need of Love Today,” as apropos a statement as he could have made.

But he danced and sang with genuine joy as he performed songs such as “HaHa (I Love You)” and “Heavy,” a centerpiece of his “Empire” performance that, he admitted, “kinda has a new meaning to me.”

On “Need Freedom,” he drew lyrical connections between what happened to him and a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, as well as the racial tensions that led to numerous protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and the police-shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.

But most of the set turned the ballads and club cuts from his “Empire” and solo work, such as “Insecurities” and “Conqueror,” into implicit assertions of his own resilience.

Gay mentors

He even cracked a few wry jokes about the experience. After telling his story about trying to fight off his attackers, he grinned and said, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

More earnestly, he said that he owed his self-confidence to the example set by the pioneering gay television actor Wilson Cruz (who was in the crowd), and artistic north stars such as Alvin Ailey and James Baldwin.

Stayed optimistic

On the stage, he told the crowd in sharp language that he “fought the … back” against his assailants. But in the end, he dedicated his set to keeping up optimism and kindness, even when one can face such visceral, physical hate.

“This hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop,” he said.

“I’ve been guilty of it too. We who celebrate love can get wrapped up in so much hate. It’s not that we become hateful, but it waters down our love. We can’t let that happen.”"

“And being a former taxi driver there made me familiar with the nooks and crannies of downtown Chicago, especially where Smollett claims to have been attacked. I have heard opinions from others who live in Chicago and they are not buying his story either.”

So, with that in mind, here is Robert Oliver’s open letter to Jesse Jackson about Jussie Smollett:

REV, YOU KNOW THE JUSSIE SMOLLETT STORY IS NOT RIGHT

First, I saw this item in The Guardian:

“Donald Trump has energized violent bigots including those allegedly behind a horrific attack on actor Jussie Smollett, who was attacked last week in Chicago in what authorities are investigating as a possible hate crime, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson has told the Guardian…’The spirit of demeaning and bullying has been revived,’ Jackson said in a phone interview, adding that he believed Trump was pushing the country towards “a crisis.” — https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/02/jesse-jackson-interview-jussie-smollett-hate-violence-us

Rev, you like Trump. Here is a piece from The New York Times in 1997:

“Donald J. Trump received an ovation when he announced that he would donate office space to Mr. Jackson’s civil rights group, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, in 40 Wall Street, a 72-story building he is renovating.

”’He’s out there pushing for a lot of good things,’ said Mr. Trump, who noted that he and Mr. Jackson had become good friends over the years.” –

This is from The New York Post:

“’We need your building skills, your gusto . . . for the people on Wall Street to represent diversity,’ Jackson, a civil-rights leader, said at a Rainbow Push Coalition event in 1999.

“And at a 1998 event in front of the same organization, Jackson said, ‘I now want to bring forth a friend — well, he is deceptive in that his social style is of such, one can miss his seriousness and commitment to success, which is beyond argument.

“’When we opened this Wall Street project . . . He gave us space at 40 Wall Street, which was to make a statement about our having a presence there.’” — https://nypost.com/2016/08/31/jesse-jackson-once-sang-donald-trumps-praises/

And here is a video of you and Mr. Trump at one of your Wall Street events in New York City. You praised him publicly at that event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mWkRdb655A

You and Trump are good friends.

Second, you are in Chicago. So am I, born and raised there. You and I have met each other several times. You know Streeterville at night. You know the Jussie Smollett “attack” story is BS.

I well know that area where Smollett claims he was attacked by “MAGA” people. I know where the Subway sandwich shop is located. It is a 5- minute walk from his home at luxury high rise North Water Apartments at 340 E. North Water Street, not far from where Oprah Winfrey used to live.

NBC News has the “attack” happening near the service entrance where loading docks are. Residents normally do not go in the service entrance. I do not see why Smollett would have a key to that door. The main entrance is on upper Water Street. Google Earth shows that clearly. And that service entrance was just around the corner from North New Street. Therefore, for this attack to logically take place, the attackers with rope and bleach just coincidentally happened to be there when he turned the corner or they were waiting especially for him to go into an entrance were other residents do not go. That area is not safe at 2 am. Drug addicts, cruisers, homeless, etc. can be found on lower Water Street at that time, not “MAGA” people.

I sent the following to the Chicago Police Department yesterday:

“IMPORTANT — Please interview Jussie Smollett again and ask him if and why he went to the service entrance of the North Water Apartments on lower Water which was not safe at all at 2 am. This was reported by NBC News Chicago by Ron Mott. What was he doing on lower North Water at all at 2 am? Why did he not go in the regular main entrance? Also, did building security video have him coming into the main lobby from the service elevator or from the front door upstairs? If he came in from the front door on upper Water Street, he took the stairs. He made the lower Water Street location a detour FOR SOME REASON before he went back home from Subway. If he came in from the service entrance, still why did he go to an unsafe location? Therefore this is a bit of information your investigators should have gotten or should get. Lower Water Street at 2 am has druggies, cruisers, homeless, etc. That is not where you would find “white supremacist MAGA people” hanging out. (By the way, I understand Smollett nor his manager Brandon Moore, who supposedly was on the phone during the attack, DID NOT mention “MAGA country” in the first interview. TMZ reported it as well as reporting a “fractured rib.” Bogus rib fracture. Possibly bogus “MAGA country” mention as well? If the mention of MAGA country was of any significance, would not that have been at the top of their minds as to a description of the suspects?) Why did Smollett want to go down there that time in the morning? If everything happened the way he claims it happened, it seems that 2 men with ski masks on, dressed in all black, with rope and bleach were waiting on him and knew him and exactly where he lived and knew he would show up at the service entrance and not the main entrance upstairs. I have no idea what your official statements say, but I have the feeling there are suspicious elements to his story. I personally do not believe him and that he filed a false police report. You should follow up. Thank you.”

The attached photos show the location of the alleged attack and of the main entrance upstairs on upper Water Street. There is a security video of him coming in the building after the “attack.” People will investigate if he came in from the service elevator or from the main entrance. The answer will shed a lot of light on this case.

Rev, you know that your good friend Donald Trump not was the cause of that bogus attack. And you know the attack was bogus.

BEST WISHES

Robert Oliver

The prestigious award is given to individuals who are role models in public service and create change.

Leon W. Russell, Chairman of the NAACP National Board of Directors, announced he would be honored to present the award to Waters. She is considered to be an inspiration and one of the most dominant and influential women in politics. Water’s 43 years as a public servant first in the State Assembly of California and presently in the U.S. House of Representatives, have benefited United States citizens.

He ended by saying that Waters is a warrior and a queen. She continues to stand tall despite the assaults on African Americans and individuals of color. She should be saluted and her legacy.

Past honorees of the NAACP Chairman’s Award include Senator Barack Obama, former Vice President Al Gore, former Surgeon General Regina Benjamin, The Neville Brothers, Ruby Dee, Tyler Perry, William Lucy, Bono, Danny Glover, Dr. Wangari Muta Maathai, TV One founder and Chairman Cathy Hughes, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Michele Howard,Dr. Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., Jussie Smollett, Rev. Dr. Jamal Harrison Bryant, Rev. Dr. Howard-John Wesley, Rev. Dr. Otis Moss III, University of Mississippi NAACP College Chapter, University of Missouri Concerned Student 1950 Collective, Justice League NYC, and Brittany “Bree” Newsome.

While in public service, Waters never shied away from controversial issues and has been known as being cutting edge.

In the 1980s, Waters founded Project Build, an organization that helps Los Angeles young people in housing developments obtain job training and placement.

After the Los Angeles civil unrest in 1992, Congresswoman Waters was the spokesperson who described the despair and hopelessness of the time.

Waters is the co-founder of the Black Woman’s forum, a nonprofit organization in Los Angeles consisting of over 1,200 African Amerian women.

The Congresswoman has been known for her advocacy for human rights, justice, and international peace. Before becoming a member of Congress, she was a leader in the movement to establish a South African democracy and to end Apartheid.

In 1998, Waters helped develop the Minority AIDS Initiative to address the alarming rate of HIV/AIDS infections among Hispanics, African American, and other minorities. With Waters at the helm, funding for the initiative increased from $156 million in 1999 to $400 million in 2018.

Waters has also introduced legislation to expand medical care for patients with cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.

She has been a leader in the women’s movement and has given financial support and encouragement of women running for public office.

Millennials have nicknamed her “Auntie Maxine,” and she has become a force within the Democratic Party. The hip-hop music community has praised her understanding of young people and their need to self-express.

The Watts Skill Center was renamed the Maxine Waters Employment Preparation Center in her honor. The facility provides employment opportunities and education to those residing in the Watts, California area.

The 50th NAACP Image Awards will take place on March 30, 2019, at 9 pm ET. Russell will be presenting the award.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Ellen Page doubled down on her criticism of celebrities that attend anti-LGBTQ churches after making headlines Thursday for calling out Chris Pratt for attending Hillsong Church.

""If you are a famous actor and you belong to an organisation that hates a certain group of people, don't be surprised if someone simply wonders why it's not addressed,"" tweeted the 31-year-old actress. ""Being anti LGBTQ is wrong, there aren't two sides. The damage it causes it severe. Full stop. Sending love to all.""

Page on Thursday criticised Pratt, 39, for attending an ""infamously anti-LGBTQ"" church after he appeared on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert and discussed his religious side.

The Guardians of the Galaxy star sat down with Stephen Colbert to promote The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, and Pratt said he just finished a 21-day Daniel Fast that he took part in through his church and that his pastor encouraged. He also said the pastor shared with him words of wisdom about balancing fame and his inner self.

""If the spotlight that is shining on you is brighter than the light that's within you, it will kill you,"" Pratt recounted to Colbert.

Page tweeted about the appearance and the pastor shortly after, writing, ""Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti LGBTQ so maybe address that too?""

Pratt attends Hillsong Church, which other celebrities like Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner and Justin Bieber have also flocked to. The megachurch was founded in Australia but now has locations in New York City and Los Angeles.

Carl Lentz, who leads the New York branch, came under fire for saying in 2015 that homosexuality is a sin and that a gay member could never hold a leadership position. And that same year, when two male choir members of the church got married, Brian Houston, the church's global senior pastor, released a statement against them.

Pratt's rep did not immediately respond to Variety's request for comment.

Page, who appeared in the X-Men films as Kitty Pryde and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2007 for her role in Juno, came out as gay in 2014 and has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights. She co-hosted the 2016 Viceland documentary series Gaycation about LGBTQ cultures around the world.

She appeared on the Late Show on January 31 ahead of the premiere of her Netflix series The Umbrella Academy. There, she spoke out against the alleged racist, homophobic attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett, and condemned Vice President Mike Pence's anti-LGBTQ policies and his support of conversion therapy.

""If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them -- you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen?"" Page said. ""Kids are going to be abused, and they're going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street.

Smollett tells the story of walking down the street in sub-zero temperatures and being attacked by two men wearing MAGA hats and screaming racial and homophobic slurs at him. Was this a hate crime?

Maybe it was. And then, maybe he wasn’t attacked at all.

The incident occurred in Chicago, a city torn by racial strife and massive distrust of the police. John Ziegler of Mediaite writes of how the investigation is unfolding:

Among other things, the police have made it very clear they have not yet found any proof of an attack, despite having almost all of Smollett’s movements on surveillance video. They have disclosed that Smollett would not give over his cell phone to verify his timeline of events. They even published photos of “persons of interest” that they had to know were going to be universally mocked for being obviously irrelevant. In my view, none of those important revelations would have been made public in the way that they were, unless there was extreme suspicion within the police force that Smollett’s story was not fully accurate. By extension, media figures would not be being told by their police sources, as I have been told is currently happening both routinely and with vigor, that the authorities are acting on the assumption that they will never find any evidence to fully substantiate Smollett’s story. This isn’t just happening via idle speculation either, the police are doing so with great specificity, even including an alternative theory for what really happened (current attempts to find the origin of the rope found around Smollett’s neck long after the event was over are believed to be the most likely game-changer, if there ever is one in this case).

In truth, the Chicago police are terrified of even hinting they doubt Smollett’s story. There is no major city in the U.S. where the cops are more distrusted by blacks than in Chicago. The police risk a riot if they let it be known they think Smollett is trying to hoax them.

The media — also massively distrusted by blacks in the city for supposedly always placing them in a bad light — is tiptoeing around the hoax story.

As for the Chicago media, a couple of local television reporters are apparently using Twitter as a confessional for information about the case that their stations currently fear to air. Rob Elgas of the Chicago ABC affiliate, and Rafer Weigel of the Fox station (which carries Smollett’s show Empire) have continually updated the developments, or lack thereof, in a way that paints a much different picture from the one that viewers would see on an actual newscast. It is very obvious that if one major news outlet in Chicago had the guts to be the first to openly discredit Smollett’s story, the others would soon follow the leader. But because the risk of being wrong in this situation (see Smollett’s PC Force Field), there is just no incentive to take that dive until and unless the police finally make a definitive statement.

Will the police let the matter die rather than prosecute Smollett? Fox’s Weigel says no:

#ChicagoPolice Supt Eddie Johnson says #JussieSmollett is still being treated as the victim in this case but if the investigation does reveal he made a false report he will be held accountable. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 5, 2019

Since so many have asked me if @Chicago_Police will let #JussieSmollett case go unsolved, I’ll give my opinion. Given the high-profile nature of the crime, I don’t believe so. I believe they’ll either find the perpetrators responsible or charge #Smollett w/ filing a false report — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 8, 2019

I will believe that when I see it.

The cops have subpoenaed Smollett’s phone records. It will be awkward for him if he fights the action. But it won’t matter now. If the police drop the matter without finding the perpetrators, the outcry in the black community will be just as loud. And if they charge Smollett, violence will be likely.

Maybe the cell phone records will buttress the actor’s case. But there are upwards of 30,000 surveillance cameras in the city and not one of them has apparently caught Smollett’s attackers."
