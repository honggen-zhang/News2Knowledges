Smollett said the assailants yelled “This is MAGA country,” bashed his face, crushed his ribs, splashed him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. Smollett’s telling of the hate crime was gobbled up hook, line and sinker by the anti-Trump news media, but Chicago police say it was a hoax. This type of hoax is part and parcel of the left’s broad agenda of victimology, fraudulence and gimmickry, plus gross media gullibility, incompetence and political attention seeking. What’s so troublesome is the fact that despite considerable evidence that the incident was a hoax, no apologies have been issued to either the public or the targets of their malfeasance — President Trump and the Americans who voted for him.

Racial hoaxes have been a major part of the leftist agenda going back decades. In 1987, the Rev. Al Sharpton created the Tawana Brawley hoax, wherein four white men were falsely accused of rape. For perpetrating the hoax, Sharpton was rewarded by receiving national recognition, millions of dollars and a career as a television/radio talk show host, and he ran for president in 2004. He also received 82 invitations to advise Barack Obama’s White House on matters of race.

Most of the nation’s racial hoaxes take place on college campuses. Recall the 2006 Duke lacrosse rape case, in which three affluent white male Duke students were falsely accused of raping a black female stripper. Police exposed Bowling Green State University student Eleesha Long as a liar after she complained about being attacked by Trump supporters the day after his election. At Goucher College in Maryland, scrawlings depicted swastikas and also spelled out the N-word and the names of four black students — including the perpetrator. The Maryland police found out that the perp was a 21-year-old black lacrosse player seeking victimhood. Nonetheless, the incident led to protests, demands for designated safe spaces and demands that incoming freshmen and transfers be required to take a “cultural competency” course.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has compiled some of the most outrageous hate crime hoaxes since Trump was elected. The hate crime hoaxes include claims of attacks on Muslim men and women by Trump supporters. A bisexual woman falsely claimed that Trump supporters were sending her nasty notes. Most of the hate crime hoaxes have been committed by black students. Their charges include the posting of KKK signs, the sending of racist notes and the writing of racist graffiti on a black person’s door with the words “Go Home N——- Boy” and “Whites Only.” A black man was caught on camera spray-painting doors and vehicles with racial slurs, vulgar words and swastikas.

Even professors create hoaxes. Indiana State University professor Azhar Hussain sent bogus anti-Muslim emails to himself, according to police, “trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself.” He was arrested for filing a false police report.

Here’s the good news about the racial hoaxes on the nation’s college campuses: Left-wing college students have a difficult time finding the actual racism they claim permeates college campuses. Thus, they have to invent it. Though it has not been proved yet, these students may have support for their racial hoaxes by diversity-crazed administrators, who nationwide spend billions of dollars on diversity and a multiculturalist agenda. Racial discord and other kinds of strife are their meal tickets.

Black people, as well as homosexuals, should condemn these hoaxes, but so far, most have remained silent. If police are right that Smollett’s claims were a dastardly hoax, it will cause doubt to be cast on future real claims of assault based on race and sexual orientation. It also will have a negative impact on race relations. This is not something to be taken lightly. If Smollett is found guilty of a felony as he is charged, he should suffer heavy penalties, including jail time. There’s a lesson to be learned from one of Aesop’s fables, “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks during a 2016 campaign rally in Amherst, Massachusetts. Associated Press

By Bob Oswald

A 1963 photo of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders with a false caption made the rounds on social media in 2016 after the presidential hopeful announced his campaign. Now that Sanders has announced his bid for 2020, the photo is being shared again.

The photo of Sanders was taken as he was being arrested during a protest over mobile classrooms that were installed because of overcrowding in black schools in the Chicago Public Schools system, according to The Associated Press.

The classrooms were seen as perpetuating segregation. The photo shows Sanders bent over as two police officers hold his arms to remove him from the protest.

Recent posts of the photo claim Sanders was being arrested for attacks against civil rights protesters in 1963, The Associated Press said.

Other uses of the photo are more specific, claiming Sanders, then 21, was arrested for throwing eggs at black civil rights protesters, according to Snopes.com. The caption with the post said, ""This is the side of Bernie Sanders that CNN and the fake news media don't want you to know.""

However, Chicago magazine reported in 2016 that Sanders' ""activist record got a boost"" as a result of the photo resurfacing, Snopes said.

Sanders was found guilty of resisting arrest and fined $25, AP said.

Obama isn't seeking leniency for Smollett

A recent Facebook post that claims former President Barack Obama had intervened on behalf of actor Jussie Smollett is false, according to PolitiFact.com.

Smollett was charged last week with making a false police report after he claimed he was the victim of a racially motivated, homophobic attack Jan. 29, according to The Associated Press.

The post said Obama ""urged (Chicago Mayor) Rahm Emanuel to pressure prosecutors in Chicago to not charge"" Smollett. It also claims Obama said, ""The sooner we bury this the better.""

Obama spokeswoman Katie Hill told PolitiFact the ""internet rumor is completely absurd.""

The social media post, which first showed up Feb. 20, has been shared 3,000 times and was flagged by Facebook in an effort to combat false news and misinformation, PolitiFact said.

The Facebook offering includes a photo of Emanuel leaning over to speak with Obama.

Emanuel served as White House chief of staff during Obama's term, and that photo is at least 10 years old, PolitiFact said.

The rumor has also appeared on Twitter and included photos of Obama and Smollett, PolitiFact said.

And Harris isn't Smollett's aunt

In other false Smollett news, U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris in not the ""Empire"" actor's aunt, according to Snopes.com.

The rumor was posted last month on Twitter by conservative radio host Kevin McCullough, Snopes said.

McCullough later deleted the tweet.

Other people forwarded the claim, pointing to the fact the California senator and Smollett's mother share the common surname Harris.

Harris has one sister, named Maya, born in Illinois and only 16 years older than Smollett, according to Snopes.

Smollett's mother, Janet (Harris) Smollett, is from New Orleans.

There is no evidence of a familial relationship between Harris and Smollett, Snopes said

Titanic lifeboats didn't discriminate

A post frequently shared on social media claims Malinda Borden drowned at sea when the Titanic sank because she was denied a spot in the lifeboats, which were reserved for only white passengers.

The story is false, according to Snopes.com, and there is no record of black people not allowed on the lifeboats.

The post, which has been circulating since at least 2016, includes an unrelated, old photo of a well-dressed black woman.

The image is so weathered it almost appears she is underwater. The Facebook claim also falsely states black workers aboard the Titanic were not listed among the passengers or victims because they were listed among the property that was lost, Snopes said.

In reality, black passengers were nearly nonexistent among the passengers and crew aboard the Titanic when it hit an iceberg and sank during its maiden voyage in 1912, according to Snopes.

The only black passenger Snopes found was Joseph Phillippe Lemercier Laroche, an engineer traveling to his home in Haiti with his wife and children.

Laroche was the sole member of the family who died, and news articles at the time listed him with the victims, not the property.

There is no evidence anyone named Malinda Borden was aboard the ship, Snopes said.

On Feb. 19, sources told The Blast that the GMA staffers in the room with Roberts and Smollett felt the validity of the actors claims were ""up in the air,"" even after the interview. When Smollett and his entourage left, there was ""immediately a feeling"" among the staff that ""something about Smollett's story was amiss.""

The Blast reports that Smollett approached GMA about doing the interview, which was recorded just as rumors about the alleged attack being a hoax began to surface. The actor specifically asked to be interviewed by Roberts, who appeared as herself in an episode of Empire last year.

During the interview, Smollett slammed rumors the attack was staged.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" he told Roberts. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.""

After more reports suggested it was a hoax, Roberts addressed the controversy surrounding her decision to interview Smollett.

“When I sat down with Jussie, it was Tuesday night in Chicago, at the time to give his first account — publicly give his first account — of what he said happened,"" Roberts said on Feb. 18. “And we have to remember, at that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.”

Smollett claimed he was attacked by two men on Jan. 29, as he walked to his Chicago apartment in the early morning hours. He claimed the men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, poured an unknown chemical on him and put a noose around his neck. He also said the men wore red ""Make America Great Again"" hats.

However, Chicago police now believe Smollett staged the attack after he failed to get attention for a threatening letter he received and was unhappy with his Empire salary. Police said Smollett gave brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo a $3,500 check to carry out the attack.

Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report and disorderly conduct. He was released on $100,000 bail and was removed from the last episodes of Empire's current season.

Smollett has maintained his innocence, while the Osundairo brothers released an apology earlier this week.

""My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,"" their attorney, Gloria Schimidt, said in a statement to CBS 2 Chicago.

""If they want our dollars and we give them by the billions, they’ve got to allow people to speak,"" said Trump in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference.

He did not describe how the executive order would work, or who would judge whether a college or university was not protecting free speech.

During his speech, President Trump brought on stage and praised Hayden Williams, who was punched last week when he was at the University of California, Berkeley, seeking support for the president and conservative causes and criticizing Jussie Smollett, the actor who is facing charges of false reporting to the police in a hate crime he claimed to have experienced.

Of Williams, President Trump said that he should sue Berkeley ""and maybe sue the state."" To loud applause, Trump said, ""He took a hard punch in the face for all of us. We can never allow that to happen."" And he added that after Williams sues Berkeley, ""he's going to be a very wealthy man."" The crowd at the meeting chanted ""USA"" as Trump made these statements.

Video has widely circulated showing Williams being punched.

Trump did not note that Berkeley arrested a man, Zachary Greenberg, for assaulting Williams. Neither Williams nor Greenberg are students at Berkeley. The university had permitted Williams to be on campus expressing his views.

Late Saturday, Berkeley released a new summary of what had happened, reiterating that the university had in this incident not wavered in its commitment to free speech or its willingness to take action in response to the attack on Williams. The statement said that events at the university have been ""willfully distorted and inaccurately reported.""

This is not the first time President Trump has used an incident at Berkeley to suggest that federal research dollars should be cut off over alleged denial of free speech rights.

In 2017, violent protesters (believed by university officials to be from off campus) set fires and damaged property at the university just before a scheduled appearance by Milo Yiannopoulos. President Trump tweeted:

If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017

What he didn't note at that time was that Berkeley officials had allowed Yiannopoulos to speak, calling off the event only amid the violence. Berkeley had defended his right to appear on campus (and he has appeared since), citing principles of free speech even as some on campus said he should be kept away because of views many find offensive.

Terry Hartle, senior vice president for government and public affairs at the American Council on Education, in an interview shortly after President Trump's Saturday speech, called the proposed executive order ""a solution in search of a problem."" He said that is because ""free speech and academic freedom are core values of research universities.""

While ""controversies do arise,"" Hartle said that the norm is for universities to err on the side of promoting free speech. He asked how some federal agency in the future would try to enforce the executive order by determining whether a college had done enough to promote free speech. He predicted that an executive order would lead people to try to create free speech incidents just to stir up controversy.

And Hartle said that federal law gives religious institutions broad discretion about campus activities. ""Would religious institutions be required to have speakers whose views were antithetical to the college?"" Hartle asked. ""Would Yeshiva University be required to host a Holocaust denier?""

Hartle also noted the lack of consistency of the Trump administration about free speech.

""As always in the current environment, irony does come into play. This is an administration that stifles the views of its own research scientists if they are counter to the political views of the administration, such as on climate change. And the president vigorously attacks people like Colin Kaepernick who exercise their free speech rights.""

Peter McPherson, president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said via email, “Public research universities have a First Amendment constitutional obligation to protect free speech. It is an obligation they take very seriously and work hard to protect. Our campuses serve as important forums for the debate of diverse ideas. An executive order is unnecessary, as public research universities are already bound by the First Amendment, which they deeply respect and honor. It is core to their academic mission.”

The Trump Administration Record

Before he was president, Trump called for the National Endowment for the Arts to stop supporting, and for museums to stop displaying art he considers to be ""gross, degenerate stuff."" And while he has been president, his staff has taken actions -- such as blocking critics from the Trump Twitter feed -- that have led to the administration being sued over First Amendment concerns.

Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, gave several speeches denouncing the squelching of speech on college campuses. But Sessions was silent about (and declined to answer questions on) squelching that was done at the behest of Republican politicians, such as when the University of Kansas took down an artwork featuring the American flag after GOP leaders in the state demanded that it come down.

The Trump administration's officials talk regularly about Berkeley. The administration has been silent as Republican legislators in Tennessee have for years tried to kill a student-organized ""Sex Week"" at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville -- an event that does not use state funds.

Views of Groups That Focus on Free Expression

Among organizations that promote free expression on campus, the response to President Trump's Saturday speech was tepid.

The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education released a statement that said in part, ""While we are glad that this important national issue has the president’s attention, we do not currently have any more information on the details of the executive order. We are looking forward to learning more about this initiative in the coming days.""

Jonathan Friedman, project director for campus free speech at PEN America, said via email, ""We need to see the text. On the surface the government reaffirming the importance of free speech on campus is appropriate and essential, particularly at a time of serious threats to open discourse. In practice, new and proposed measures ostensibly intended to protect speech can yield unintended negative consequences for speech, which we've documented in our work. While we at PEN America reserve judgment until a draft of the order is released, we believe that any government action on this issue should be approached in a thoughtful, nonpartisan manner, upholding the universal principles of free speech and academic freedom.""

Debra Mashek, executive director of Heterodox Academy, said via email that ""we need diversity and dialogue, not decrees.""

Added Mashek, “Heterodox Academy encourages individual colleges and universities to advance common-sense policies and practices that promote teaching, learning and discovery. Higher ed would not benefit from a blunt, top-down, partisan decree that politicizes the academy’s core values of open inquiry and academic freedom. Governments cannot legislate campus cultures. In order to create classrooms and campuses that welcome diverse people with diverse viewpoints and that equip learners with the habits of heart and mind to engage that diversity in open inquiry and constructive disagreement, colleges and universities must harness their own values, histories and capacities.”

Could Solomon Amendment Be a Model?

Many in higher education questioned how the executive order might work. Two proponents of the measure, however, say that the Solomon Amendment provides a model.

In an article in National Affairs last year, Frederick M. Hess and Grant Addison, both of the American Enterprise Institute, called for federal funds to be cut off to American colleges that do not support free expression on campus. They said that the precedent for this could be the Solomon Amendment, the 1996 law that barred federal funds from going to colleges and universities that did not permit military recruiting or Reserve Officer Training Corps programs on campus. The law came at a time when some colleges were barring the military from campus, citing its policies (since lifted) of discriminating against gay people. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 upheld the constitutionality of the amendment, which was challenged by law schools.

While there was no dispute that some colleges barred the military, in the case of free expression, some institutions (such as Berkeley) denounced by President Trump can point to evidence that they in fact support free expression.

""New federal guidance in this area has a chance to make free inquiry and free speech relevant to the broader scientific research community in a fashion that it has not been previously,"" says the article. ""The slumbering, silent middle on campus may awaken when accomplished researchers bringing in millions in 'indirect' costs suddenly recognize that the ideological crusades of their colleagues may imperil their laboratories and research projects. Campus leaders who have found it easy to virtue signal by indulging students and faculty demanding constraints on speech will now have a fairer fight on their hands, and they will need to be worried about their biochemistry and engineering faculty departing for institutions eligible for federal funds."""

Trump called Hayden Williams up to the stage as he spoke to the cheering crowd at the conservative conference in National Harbor, Maryland on Saturday afternoon.

Williams was tabling for the student group Turning Point USA on February when a man charged up and accused him of 'promoting violence' before socking Williams in the face, in a shocking attack caught on video. A suspect, 28-year-old Zachary Greenberg, was arrested on Friday.

'Do me a favor - sue him!' Trump told Williams onstage at CPAC, as Williams gave a double thumbs-up. 'He's probably got nothing, but sue him forever. Sue the college, the university, and maybe sue the state.'

'He took a hard punch in the face for all of us, remember,' Trump continued. 'And we can never allow that to happen.'

'He's going to be a very wealthy young man. Go get 'em, Hayden,' the President concluded, shaking Williams' hand and embracing the young activist.

Trump embraced Williams after praising the young activist, and announced an imminent executive order mandating protections for free speech on college campuses

Williams' surprise appearance tied into Trump's announcement during the more than two hour speech that that he will soon sign an executive order 'requiring colleges and universities to support free speech.'

'If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they have to allow ... all people to speak. And if they don't, it will be very costly,' he said.

On Friday, Greenberg was arrested in Berkeley following a 10-day search for the suspect seen attacking Williams on video.

Zachary Greenberg, 28, was charged with assault with a deadly weapon on Friday

He was held on $30,000 bail in Alameda County jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon likely to produce great bodily injury.

He is to be arraigned on Monday at the Wiley W. Manuel Courthouse in Oakland.

Neither Greenberg or Williams are students at the UC-Berkeley.

In a statement to Campus Reform, Williams expressed his view of the news of his attacker's arrest: 'I am grateful to the University of California Berkeley Police Department for its dedication to identifying and arresting the man who attacked me.'

'But while this is a moment for celebration, I remain disappointed by the UC Berkeley Administration, which allowed a culture of intolerance and violence toward conservatives to grow,' he continued.

'I hope UC Berkeley’s leadership will seize on this moment-in-time to take deliberate steps to establish a zero tolerance policy when it comes to violence, and restore Berkeley’s legacy as ‘Home of the Free Speech Movement,' Williams concluded.

Video from the incident shows Williams (left) being confronted by a violent attacker who punched him in the face as he was recruiting for a conservative student group

Williams was running a campus recruitment table for Turning Points USA, a conservative activist group, when he was approached by his attacker in Sproul Plaza.

The sign on the table read 'hate crime hoaxes hurt real victims,' a reference to allegations that actor Jussie Smollett staged a racist and anti-gay attack against himself in Chicago.

Willaims said in an interview with Fox News that a man charged up to the table acting 'erratically' and accused him of 'provoking violence.'

The suspect is heard on video shouting: 'Mother f**ker. You racist little inbred b***h. C**t!'

Williams (left) is seen 'tabling' at UC-Berkley on another occasion last summer

UC-Berkeley campus police said that the attack took place at 3.29pm on Upper Sproul Plaza, and that two men initially approached the table confronting Williams.

'A physical confrontation ensued when one of the two men slapped the phone out of the victim’s hand,' the police statement said.

The attacker then knocked over the table and the two men fought over the phone.

During the incident, the suspect punched the victim several times causing injuries to the eye and nose, police said.

Williams was helping Turning Point USA, but he is not actually a member of the group. Williams is campus representative for Leadership Institute, which runs Campus Reform, the website that first reported on the incident."

AP The two brothers who allegedly helped Empire star Jussie Smollett stage a fake homophobic and racist street assault in Chicago say they have ""tremendous regret"" about it and know the impact it will have on true victims of hate crimes.

​Smollett told police his attackers shouted racist and homophobic slurs and referred to ""MAGA,"" President Trump's political slogan, Make America Great Again.

The brothers were arrested on February 15, detained and interrogated for nearly 48 hours, and finally told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack. Police released them without charges.

Chicago police had insisted all along that Smollett was a crime victim until suddenly he wasn't: On February 20, police charged him with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report. He pleaded not guilty.

On February 21, at a blistering press conference, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that Smollett paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack to look like a hate crime in order to ""take advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

Now the brothers are apologising for their alleged role in the episode. Earlier, on Feb. 18, they also issued a statement in response to inaccurate media reports about their views and citizenship.

""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump,"" the brothers told CBS in Chicago. ""We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

The brothers, who are bodybuilders and also work as trainers, were well acquainted with Smollett because Abel Osundairo, 25, worked on Empire as a stand-in for a character that was Smollett's character's love interest on the show, according to prosecutors.

The brothers worked out with Smollett and one served as his personal trainer, according to Smollett's attorneys. Prosecutors said Abel occasionally sold the drugs to Smollett.

""Today, I'm proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech if they want federal research dollars,"" Trump said before chants of ""USA!"" broke out. ""If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they've got to allow people like Hayden [Williams], and many other great young people and old people to speak. Free speech.""

""If they don't, it will be very costly. That will be signed very soon,"" he added.

Before that, Trump brought up Hayden Williams, a Leadership Institute field representative who was violently attacked in an incident captured on-camera last week while recruiting for a conservative student group at the University of California-Berkeley.

Trump said the attack was ""disgusting"" and joked that, for the benefit of the media, he wouldn't wish similar treatment on the assailant.

""Just for the media, I'm sure he's a lovely young man, just had a little temper tantrum,"" Trump said. ""I've been there before with those people, I don't want to do it again.""

Trump invited Williams to speak, where he received an ovation from the crowd and said he was glad to speak on behalf of conservatives facing ""discrimination"" on campuses.

""I would just like to say, if these socialist progressives had their way, they would put the Constitution through the paper shredder in a heart beat,"" Williams said.

Williams said if Trump kept defending them, they would keep defending him. Trump praised him for being able to take a punch and advised him to sue his attacker, Berkeley and maybe the state of California.



""He took a punch for all of us … Here is the good news,"" Trump said. ""He's going to be a very wealthy young man.""



Williams, who was recruiting for the right-wing student group Turning Point on Berkeley's main plaza on Feb. 19, was accosted by two men who were upset with a sign referencing the harm of hate crime hoaxes in the wake of the Jussie Smollett case. One man flipped over his table, began shoving him and cursing at him, and punched him in the face, leaving Williams with a black left eye.

According to the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office, 19-year-old Ryan M. Salvagno was arrested for allegedly assaulting the man, an 81-year-old wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat who was exiting a store with his groceries, according to NJ.com.

Salvagno reportedly started an argument with the elderly man over his hat and, according to witnesses, continued to harass the man even as he attempted to walk away from the Shop Rite in Franklin Township with his cart full of groceries.

“As the victim turned to walk away, defendant Salvagno was able to grab the victim’s hat and the two struggled for sole possession of the hat,” prosecutor Michael H. Robertson said.

“Salvagno then took the victim by the arm and threw him to the ground, tipping over the victim’s cart of groceries and ultimately throwing the hat to the side,” he added in a statement.

The unidentified victim suffered minor injuries, according to the prosecutor’s office and refused medical treatment or transport to the hospital. The teen was not on the scene when police officers arrived.

Salvagno was eventualy identified by law enforcement officers and he was arrested two days later and “charged with assault, a disorderly persons offense, and harassment, a petty disorderly persons offense, the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office announced,” according to MyCentralJersey.

The teen graduated in 2017 from Franklin High and competed on the wrestling team for the Franklin Warriors since 2014, according to Canyon News. He is scheduled for arraignment on March 14 in Franklin Township Municipal Court.

The incident is the latest in a growing list of violent crimes against President Donald Trump’s supporters and comes after the scandal involving “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett who allegedly staged a fake hate-crime against himself, describing his attackers as wearing MAGA hats.

An 18-year-old Oklahoma student could be facing assault and battery charges after his attack on a minor student wearing a MAGA hat and a Trump flag as a cape was caught on video.

Just last month, a Tennessee man was arrested after he admitted that a couple’s MAGA hats in a Kentucky Sam’s Club triggered him into pulling a gun on them as he allegedly said, “It’s a good day for you to die.”

The attack of the 81-year-old man and the despicable act by the teenager were condemned by Twitter users who reacted to the report of his arrest.

Jussie Smollett of the TV show ""Empire"" has recently been in the media and it's not a pretty story.

The short of it: One night in Chicago he claimed that he was the victim of a hate crime. He said assailants poured bleach on him, roughed him up and hung a rope around his neck all the time yelling racism and homophobic slurs. The Chicago police questioned two men, who are brothers, as possible suspects in the incident. Turns out the men knew Smollett and have worked on ""Empire.""

The men later said that Smollett paid them to create the hate crime. At present, we don't know the full story or whether a hate crime actually occurred or if Smollett orchestrated this incident. But, many are already criticizing the actor for doing this during Black History Month.

Being black and gay and open about it is brave, and comes with it much hate. So, no matter what the outcome of this incident, Smollett has already suffered, and possible been broken by that hate. But, either way, it is heinous - the hate crime or the invention of a hate crime. And, while we don't know yet which is true, we need to realize that one person is not an entire group of people, whether black or LGBT.

There are other people of color who we can celebrate this Black History Month. How about Bayard Rustin, chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington; Janet Mock, activist, author and most recently writer for the TV show ""Pose;"" Alice Walker, author, poet, and advocate; E. Denise Simmons, former mayor of Cambridge, Mass., who during her 2008-2009 term was the first openly lesbian African-American mayor in the United States; Angela Davis, political advocate, scholar, and author; and James Baldwin, author and activist. There are many, many more, but let me end with my sister from Gay Liberation Front, Marsha P. Johnson, who helped create the first trans organization in the nation Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries … STAR!

Los Angeles Times

(TNS)

Police have arrested a man on suspicion of attacking a conservative activist on the University of California, Berkeley campus in an incident that was recorded and widely shared online.

Zachary Greenberg, who is not a UC Berkeley student, was arrested Friday and booked into jail, according to UC police. He is accused of punching Hayden Williams, also not a student at the university, on Feb. 19.

Many conservatives were angered that it took 10 days for police to make the arrest. President Donald Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. this week wrote on Twitter about the apparent delay: “Wonder if it would be the same if a conservative beat up a leftist on the Berkeley campus?”

Berkeley College Republicans posted a video of the incident on their Facebook page last week. The video shows a man cursing and punching Williams in the face in Sproul Plaza, the main gathering place on campus.

“Another conservative was brutally assaulted on our campus while recruiting for Turning Point USA by a tolerant, inclusive liberal,” the Republican club posted on Facebook. “This marks yet another incident where right-leaning individuals on the Berkeley campus have been put in danger for simply exercising their God-given rights to free expression.”

Williams is a field representative for the Leadership Institute, a nonprofit organization that trains conservative activists, he told Fox News. He had been invited to UC Berkeley to help Turning Point USA recruit members, he said.

A sign on the he manned on Sproul Plaza said “Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,” referring to the recent incident involving “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who is accused of faking an attack against himself in Chicago last month.

“Every time I’ve gone to help students at Berkeley for various clubs, there’s always a student or a member of the campus community who will rip up our signs or flip over our table, but this is the first time it’s really escalated to this level of violence,” Williams said on Fox News.

UC Berkeley, the liberal enclave and birthplace of the free speech movement, has become a frequent setting for debates over the First Amendment and conservative beliefs in recent years. An event planned to hear right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos was shut down by angry protests in February 2017, which was followed by a rescheduling of a visit by conservative commentator Ann Coulter.

“Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason. That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here,” UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ said in a statement. “Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.”

Greenberg, 28, was released on bail, according to jail records."

Twenty-five years ago, American media outlets ran ’round-the-clock news circuits on the O.J. Simpson trial. O.J., who was a star on the football field and on the movie screen, was tried on two counts of murder for the June 12, 1994, deaths of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ron Goldman.

O.J.’s infamous trial birthed the controversial concept of the “O.J. syndrome,” which occurs when an individual has become so committed to a lie that the lie becomes real to the liar, despite others knowing it to be untrue. Not only is the liar able to relay vivid details of this fabricated experience, but he or she is also able to convey the occurrence with all the consistencies of a true story.

Smollett’s commitment to his account of the hate crime — even in the face of the Osundairo brothers testifying to its untruth — and the vivid details of that night that he was able to recall (e.g., hearing men yell “This is MAGA country!” and finding a noose wrapped around his neck) are symptomatic of the “O.J. syndrome.” Although the presence of symptoms is not a diagnosis of a disease, Smollett’s persistent preservation of his portrayal of events is indicative of the need to maintain his innocence regardless of any evidence to the contrary.

In Smollett’s case, there are no horrific double homicides of an ex-lover and their friend, or interruptions of grandma’s favorite midday soap operas, or a televised pursuit of the alleged culprit in a white Ford Bronco. There is, however, the hiring of a high-profile defense team, the manipulation of the current state of race relations in this country, and the recounting of a crime that has created as much social outrage as it has created unanswered questions.

In maintaining his innocence, Smollett’s case, like O.J.’s, is thriving off its sensationalism, almost to the point of disbelief. For instance, in the 2010 documentary, O.J. Monster or Myth?, Marcia Clark, a prosecutor in the O.J. trial, said that after the trial had ended, people would come up to her on the street and say, “God, I loved your show.” Now, in the 2019 media coverage of Smollett’s impending trial, you can scroll through Twitter or in the comment sections on Instagram and find a very similar sentiment: “Am I watching an episode of ‘Empire?’ ”

Despite the public’s reluctance to believe his story, what matters most is whether Smollett believes it to be true. Oftentimes, the desire for fame and the preservation of it can lead one down a suffocating path of maintaining public perception. The addiction to fame, which is fed by fans, is often the driving force behind a celebrity’s elaborate lies to secure their social status. If that’s the case, then maybe Smollett is simply engulfed in a deeply rooted self-deception to fan the flames of fame, and the fire has gotten so wildly out of control that he is unable to put it out.

But in the end, as always, the problem with fanning flames is that someone, one way or another, always gets burned."

Back in 2008, John Mulaney began his long working relationship with Saturday Night Live when he auditioned for the show and was instead hired as part of the SNL Writers’ Room. However, it wasn’t until 10 years later, on April 14, 2018, when Mulaney finally got to host the show. The wait for his second hosting gig wasn’t nearly as long, he actually only had to wait 10 months because tonight at 11:30pm on NBC, SNL announcer Darrell Hammond will introduce John Mulaney as SNL host for a second time. Hopefully Hammond will say “John Mulaney” this time. Last season, Darrell Hammond had a little problem with the comedian’s name and introduced him as as John “Mulvaney,” not once but twice.

Hosting last season during SNL – Season 43 and being back again this season, really puts John Mulaney on the fast-track to the Saturday Night Live Five-Timers Club. At this rate, Mulaney will gain membership in…well, another 3 years. The math wasn’t all that hard.

No matter what you call him, John Mulaney has become an SNL fan favorite. When beloved Saturday Night Live alum Bill Hader returned to the show to host last year during SNL – Season 43, he appeared as popular Weekend Update character, club kid Stefon, a character that Mulaney co-created during his days as an SNL writer. It was during that appearance that John Mulaney slid up to the Weekend Update desk himself next to Stefon as his attorney and conceptual piss artist, Shy. This past January, Mulaney made another surprise Weekend Update appearance when he arrived to do a bit with his pal Pete Davidson who had just recently scared the hell out of his loved ones with an online suicide post. The two hilariously reviewed the latest Clint Eastwood movie, “The Mule” which they had seen together while on the road performing during the holiday break. They also took the time to address Pete’s cry for help. We should expect to see more of Mulaney and Davidson working together on tonight’s show. Their movie review was such a social media success, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the comedy duo reprise the bit on tonight’s Weekend Update.

Mulaney’s relationship with SNL‘s Pete Davidson goes beyond just that single Weekend Update appearance. As mentioned, they went out on the road touring together during Saturday Night Live‘s mid-season break and Pete Davidson’s mid-season breakdown. Currently, they’re co-headlining comedy shows in theaters on a tour called “Sundays with John & Pete.” The two have been performing around New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York together and have more dates coming up. Tickets are available at JohnMulaney.com. The double headliner tour is credited by friends and online insiders as having been a tremendous help to Pete Davidson during his latest mental health crisis. They seem like an unlikely pair, but Mulaney and Davidson are proving opposites attract. At the very least, the two comics are fashion opposites. This was very obvious when John and Pete traded clothes for a performance during their second show a couple of Sundays ago in Red Bank, New Jersey. For a look at the two of them after a trip through each other’s closets, check out the article on the IBang titled, “John Mulaney and Pete Davidson Pull a Freaky Friday.”

Last year when John Mulaney hosted Saturday Night Live, he was promoting his new stand up special “John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City” which premiered last May on Netflix and is currently available for streaming. Mulaney, who has already starred in his own sitcom (“Mulaney“) and was a smash hit on Broadway with his comedy partner Nick Kroll in “Oh, Hello!“, has had a great year since his time hosting SNL. He’s been touring the country with and without Pete Davidson, he wrote for the 2019 Golden Globes hosted by Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh, he voiced a second season worth of episodes of the Netflix animated comedy “Big Mouth” created by Nick Kroll, he co-wrote and starred in what’s been called the best and most ambitious episode of IFC’s “Documentary Now!” titled “Original Cast Album: Co-Op,” a hysterical parody of D.A. Pennebaker’s 1970 documentary about Stephen Sondheim’s “Original Cast Album: Company.” The biggest success of the past year for John Mulaney has to be his voice work in the critically acclaimed box office hit animated film, “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” Wait. Make that the Academy Award winning “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” which just won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. Mulaney’s voice role was a breakout favorite for fanboys everywhere. He provided the voice for Spider-Ham, the Looney Tunes inspired cartoon pig version of Spider-Man from a parallel universe who provides the comic relief for the hit animated superhero film. And just this past Sunday, John Mulaney made his Academy Awards presenter debut when he and Awkwafina (“Crazy Rich Asians” and an SNL host herself this season) awarded the Oscars in the Best Short Film categories.

As for tonight’s SNL, let’s see, what could Saturday Night Live possibly grab from this week’s national news for its cold open, sketches, digital shorts and Weekend Update ? Gee, how about former Trump lawyer and current songbird Michael Cohen’s testimony and questioning in front of Congress??. We’re betting that Ben Stiller was glued to cable news coverage of Cohen’s Congressional Q&A to get ready for a possible return SNL tonight as the man the President and conservatives call a rat and the who the liberals call a redeemed, democracy saving hero. There’s also President Trump’s trip to Vietnam where he failed to reach an agreement with North Korea’s dear leader Kim Jong Un. So, we may see Alec Baldwin return as President Trump playing off the real one who couldn’t convince North Korea to give up their nukes with one of his famously “huuuge” deals. But it’s not like Trump went to ‘Nam (finally) and didn’t bring us anything. He did come home clearing North Korea’s Kim Jong Un of any wrong-doing in the imprisonment, torture and death of college student Otto Warmbier. So, we did get another embarrassing endorsement of a vicious tyrant for Baldwin to use as material.

Other items in the news for Saturday Night Live to parody this evening include the Oscars duet with Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper from “A Star is Born” that had everyone gossiping. Cast member Melissa Villaseñor needs to have her brilliant Lady Gaga impression which she recently unveiled on SNL ready to go. Also from the Oscar headlines, there’s Glenn Close going home from the Academy Awards empty-handed yet again. There’s also Jussie Smollett from “Empire” who was arrested and charged with a felony for allegedly faking a homophobic, anti-black hate crime attack on himself by two purported MAGA loving thugs, along with Bryce Harper agreeing to a record-breaking 13-year, $330 million contract with Phillies- the biggest overall free-agent contract in North American sports history, T-Pain being revealed as “The Masked Singer“, the Momo Challenge hoax, the obese rat stuck in an NYC manhole cover grate, and of course, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft getting nabbed by the cops for soliciting sex at a Florida massage parlor.

When John Mulaney hosted Saturday Night Live last season, we saw SNL do a couple of the sketches that Mulaney wrote with different writing partners back when he was part of the Saturday Night Live writing staff years ago. Those originally rejected sketches were produced and brought to life nearly a decade later. One was the outrageous “Diner Lobster“ musical sketch, which was a huge production number parodying “Les Misérables” on Broadway and the other was “Sitcom Reboot” which Mulaney wrote about a TV sitcom creator looking back nostalgically at his 90’s series about a boy and his father who switch bodies and then proceed to try to answer the question on no one’s mind- which one should be sleeping with the mom? We’ll see tonight if Lorne Michaels lets John Mulaney go back through his old SNL files and once again give another retired Mulaney sketch or two a chance to finally live.

We have the promos for tonight’s brand new Saturday Night Live for you to watch below. In the first promo released this week by SNL, we see host John Mulaney reminiscing about the time before he joined SNL as a writer. It’s when he first auditioned to be an SNL cast member. In the promo, we get see several of Mulaney’s many, many, many audition attempts. One even goes as far back as Saturday Night Live‘s inaugural season in 1975. In the next set of promos, Mulaney is joined by musical guest Thomas Rett and cast member Kate McKinnon as they go over some previously rejected SNL promos that Mulaney wrote and couldn’t get on the air. Then we see these “two gorgeous nephews” prepare for an epic Saturday Night Live episode which will be a “singular cultural event,” that is according to Kate McKinnon.

John Mulaney hosts a brand new episode of Saturday Night Live with musical guest Thomas Rhett tonight at 11:30pm et and live across all time zones on NBC!

And next Saturday, it’s another new SNL hosted by Idris Elba with musical guest Khalid!

1. There is little racism in America.

2. The left — white and black — is morally and psychologically impaired.

There is no doubt that most Americans on the left, including black Americans, are distraught over the fact that Smollet faked the “racist” attack on him. Apparently, leftists, Democratic leaders and, most depressingly, many of his fellow blacks wish Smollett had been attacked by white racist homophobes.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a white leftist, tweeted, “I hope this was not something that Mr. Smollett did to himself, or created….”

Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart told MSNBC there has been “an atmosphere of menace and hate” since Donald Trump was elected president, which made “people want to believe” Smollett’s story. Exactly. Capehart, a black leftist, wanted to believe that racists yelling “This is MAGA country” beat up blacks.

Another black leftist who writes hate columns for The Washington Post, Nana Efua Mumford, wrote: “I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did.” Again, exactly. Mumford wanted to believe that racists yelling “This is MAGA country” beat up blacks.

Corey Townsend, the social media editor of The Root, a black-oriented website (founded in 2008 by Harvard black studies scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.), opened his column on his private doubts that Smollett was attacked as he claimed with the words, “I wanted to be wrong.” Three paragraphs later: “But still, I wanted to be wrong.”

This should tell you a great deal about how morally and psychologically sick the left is. And their reactions prove how little racism there really is in America.

Here’s the proof of both these assertions: When American Jews, even most left-wing Jews, heard of the mass killing of Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue, how many were hoping the shooter was truly an anti-Semite, and how many were hoping he was a mentally deranged individual who could have just as easily shot up a church? Or, if a well-known Jew had been beaten at 2 a.m. on a Chicago street, how many American Jews would have wanted the attackers to be Jew-haters, and how many would have wished they were just thugs who wanted money?

As a Jew who has been deeply involved in Jewish culture all my life, I am pretty certain the majority of Jews — certainly liberal and conservative Jews, and even most left-wing Jews — would have wished that neither the Pittsburgh synagogue nor the theoretical attack on a Chicago street I conjured up were perpetrated by anti-Semites.

Why is that? Why do almost all Jews wish attackers of Jews not be anti-Semites, but so many blacks and so many white leftists wish Smollett had been attacked by racists?

Because Jews want to believe there is little anti-Semitism in America while most black leftists and most white leftists want to believe there is a lot of racism in America.

And why is that? Because the left and many American blacks are politically and personally dependent on one of the greatest mass libels in history — namely, that America is a racist country. If just one 1 of 5 black Americans woke up tomorrow and announced, “You know, this a great country for anyone, including a black person, to live in, and the truth is the vast majority of white Americans bear no ill will toward blacks (or any other race or ethnicity),” that would end the Democrats’ chances of winning national elections. The Democratic Party is dependent on nearly universal black acceptance of the leftist libel of America.

And what about the personal? Why do so many black Americans, living in the freest country for all its citizens — and in the least-racist multiracial, multiethnic country in history — want to believe America is racist? That is one of the most important questions all Americans need address at this time.

And there is another one, which I posed in my column last week: Does the left believe its own lies?

“See, what had happened was ...” is a staple phrase in black households that typically proceeds a preposterous explanation for questionable behavior.

But since Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo—the Nigerian-American siblings involved in the allegedly bogus attack on the self-proclaimed “gay 2Pac” Jussie Smollet—aren’t in a position to further incriminate the Empire star who’s facing felony charges for allegedly orchestrating his own MAGA-inspired beatdown, they’ve decided to issue a public, “See what had happened was ...” through their attorney without actually telling us what had happened—a conveniently vague apology, if you will.

According to People, the Osundairo brothers are overcome with “tremendous regret” for their involvement in their poorly executed scheme, while the rest of are wondering why in the hell they pulled this shit during Black History Month.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation,” their statement to CBS Chicago read. “And they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.”

While it’s not looking good for their boy Jussie—who’s spent the aftermath of this debacle being removed from the final two episodes of this season of Empire, being blasted by the gay, black, white, and MAGA communities for his baffling actions, and being slapped with a felony charge for filing a false police report and disorderly conduct—his legal team has maintained its commitment to an “aggressive defense” in fighting the charge.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” his attorneys said in a statement.

Meanwhile, we’re still waiting for Jussie’s “See, what had happened was ...”"

Smollett stepped out with his family for dinner on Thursday night in Chicago. The actor is nowhere to be seen in new photos published by The Blast. He reportedly joined his brother Jake, an unidentified woman and a small security team for dinner at Eddie V's Prime Seafood.

The photos do show Smollett's bodyguard, who led him out of jail last month. The actor was reportedly just behind the recognizable man, keeping a low profile on the street and in the restaurant as well. There was no clear look at his face. Smollett is reportedly staying at a hotel in Chicago to avoid the media frenzy building around his apartment. Eddie V's is just half a mile from his home.

EXCLUSIVE: Jussie Smollett seen for the first time since his arrest. //t.co/AguT5qePaK — The Blast (@TheBlastNews) March 1, 2019

Smollett rode to the dinner date in the same black SUV that he left jail in late last month after his arrest for allegedly faking a hate crime against himself. In addition, he was accompanied by at least one security guard that was with him that day.

The actor and his family did not speak to any reporters on the scene, though Smollett's family has been very supportive of him through the whole scandal.

Smollett's sister, actress Jurnee Smollett, took aim at the media for its portrayal of the whole story. She quoted Malcolm X, saying that news outlets were making the “victim look like the criminal"" in this case.

Still, as the case gets more and more convoluted, Smollett has lost some high profile allies. The actor is now taking a break from his role on Empire, despite producers' early support of him. In a statement, the show's staff said that they trust the legal system, and they simply wanted to bench Smollett to avoid ""disruptions.""

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,"" the producers said. ""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Smollett and his lawyers continue to claim his innocence in this case. This week, Chicago Police Superintendence Eddie Johnson went on Good Morning America, saying that ""there's a lot more evidence"" to support the department's charges against Smollett.

""I just hope people don't judge other folks that are victims of these types of crimes because this is just one particular incident. That's the damaging part of it,"" he added. ""You damage the city's reputation. We don't need any help with that; we really don't."""

University of California police officers booked Zachary Greenberg into jail in the wake of an attack on a member of Turning Point USA, an activist group that supports President Trump. The incident took place on Feb. 19, and the footage, taken by the victim and bystanders, went viral.





“UCPD will formally present the case to the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office for consideration of the filing of criminal charges,” the UC-Berkeley Public Affairs team announced in a campus publication. “Once the matter is presented and reviewed by the District Attorney’s Office, additional information will be made available regarding a charging decision.

Bail for the 28-year-old Greenberg has been set at $30,000, according to local media.

Hayden Williams, a TPUSA activist, was punched while manning a booth adorned by pro-Trump signs and placards critical of Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who is accused of staging a hoax hate crime against himself. Williams began to record the encounter as his critics gathered — “I’m just going to video it for my own safety, because you seem really erratic,” he told one person who accused him of “encouraging violence” — but that angered the pair. He was attacked moments later.

“Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason,” Carol Christ, the university chancellor, said in response to the incident. “That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here. Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.”

Williams is a Leadership Institute staffer who was on campus to help TPUSA recruit new student members. Greenberg is not a student.

“The fact that the victim was not a campus affiliate has no bearing on this case,” campus representative Dan Mogulof said while the search for the attacker was under way. “He had every right to be on campus, and every right to express his point of view.”

""There's a certain culture there that is especially hostile on Berkeley's campus and across the country to conservative students,"" Williams said in an interview with Fox Business Network. ""[T]hey're willing to use violence if they think that you're being too controversial."""

Zachary Greenberg was arrested Friday by university police after a judge issued a warrant for his arrest, Fox News reported. The arrest came a week after officials had closed the investigation, which they reopened Friday.

UC-Berkeley spokeswoman Diana Harvey said Greenberg worked for the college from May 21 to July 9, 2010 as a Department of Psychology lab assistant, according to Campus Reform. He was also “briefly” a non-degree seeking student at the school, Harvey said.

Greenberg faces charges of assault with a deadly weapon and attempting to cause great bodily injury.

The attack on 26-year-old Hayden Williams, which was recorded on cell phone videos, took place Feb. 19 while Williams, a field representative for The Leadership Institute, was recruiting for the conservative college group Turning Point USA.

Williams was standing next to a table with a sign that read, “Hate Crimes Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,” in reference to the Jussie Smollett case, KPIX reported. Williams said he was approached by two men who were angered over the signs.

Williams, 26, was punched in the face repeatedly by one of the men, whom the police later identified as Greenberg, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.

“While every America should be afforded their due process, we believe that the video evidence in this case is incontrovertible,” Charlie Kirk, founder and President of Turning Point USA, said in a statement.

“We hope 28-year-old Zachary Greenberg is prosecuted to the full extent of the law for assault with a deadly weapon, which should be considered an act of hate. Hopefully, this dark chapter will act as a wake up call to those concerned about actual politically motivated hate crimes in America,” he said. “Berkeley and all college campuses across American should be safe havens for free thought and opinions – especially for a targeted conservative minority.”

The delayed response from Berkeley concerning the attack was blasted on social media as indicative of the attitude of colleges toward conservatives.

College officials have pushed back against claims that the investigation received lower priority because the victim was a conservative.

“Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason,” Chancellor Carol Christ and Vice Chancellor for student affairs Stephen C. Sutton wrote in a statement, The Washington Post reported.

“That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here. Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.”

Greenberg is scheduled to appear in court on Monday. He is currently being held on $30,000 bail.

Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) is facing questions after campaign records revealed she paid herself $17,500 as a salary after the midterm elections, in what appeared to be a violation of campaign finance rules, a report said.

Tlaib, a firebrand freshman Democrat from Detroit, has been facing scrutiny over her connections to radical anti-Israel activists and a profane call to impeach President Donald Trump.

She caused an uproar on Capitol Hill earlier this week by insinuating that Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) — her colleague on the House Oversight and Reform Committee — had used Trump family friend Lynne Patton, an African-American, as a racist “prop” during former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s appearance before the panel.

Yet the latest filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) may land the radical congresswoman in hot water with questions on whether her campaign broke the rules after making salary payments to Tlaib after Election Day last year.

Tlaib’s campaign began paying her a salary of about $4,000 every month since May 2018 up until the general election November 6 — a perfectly legal practice if the campaign chose to do so.

But according to the filings, as first spotted by The Washington Free Beacon, Tlaib also paid herself $2,000 on November 16 and a whopping $15,500 on December 1 — weeks after the election was over, in an apparent violation of FEC statutes.

MORE NEWS: NOLA Protests

The FEC rules state that a general election candidate is allowed to dip into campaign coffers to give himself or herself a salary only up to the election date. The candidate can no longer draw a salary after the election date, or because of other reasons that ended the campaign.

“An after-the-fact, lump-sum payment cuts against the purpose of the rule, which is to help the candidate pay for daily living expenses while campaigning,” said a lawyer.

“If the candidate loses the primary, withdraws from the race, or otherwise ceases to be a candidate, no salary payments may be paid beyond the date he or she is no longer a candidate,” the rules state.

A Tlaib ally, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) grabbed headlines last year after saying that due to the rules that prohibit the use of campaign funds to pay a salary after the election date, she would have trouble finding an apartment in Washington, D.C., until she began receiving a paycheck for her work in Congress.

“I have three months without a salary before I’m a member of Congress. So, how do I get an apartment? Those little things are very real,” Ocasio-Cortez told The New York Times at the time.

Tlaib’s office didn’t respond to Fox News’ request for a comment and clarification of the nature of the salary payment.

An FEC spokesperson told The Washington Free Beacon that candidates are allowed to make payments to themselves after the election — but only for activities that happened during the election period.

An election law and government ethics lawyer also told the outlet that Tlaib may have deflated her monthly payments during the campaign for political purposes while “knowing full well that she would make up any difference at the end by giving herself a lump sum payment.”

“That would let her skirt negative publicity, of the sort that Alan Keyes generated when he paid himself a sizable salary. An after-the-fact, lump-sum payment cuts against the purpose of the rule, which is to help the candidate pay for daily living expenses while campaigning,” the lawyer added.

The legendary words of Andy Warhol in 1968 have proven to be quite prophetic. With the rise of celebrity culture and social media, what’s trending on Twitter today, causing shockwaves and garnering international attention will soon be forgotten with the next big story.

Whereas fame used to be a by-product of talent, in today’s culture people are just ‘famous for being famous.”

The likes of Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton have paved the way for a generation of fame vultures. From the reckless stunt by “ChairGirl,” Nicole Scherzinger’s leaked nude photos, Jordyn Woods’ and Tristan Thompson’s cheating scandal to the Prada, Gucci and Katy Perry blackface fashion faux-pas, there is a common thread that ties these recent stories together: BIG. BOLD. HEADLINES.

None of these names have done anything exemplary to garner their latest attention, rather the contrary. And though people may be talking about them for all the wrong reasons, it doesn’t seem to matter. In our celebrity-obsessed society, fame doesn’t come with a conscience — bad behaviour is simply brushed over with an apology. More so than ever, the goal appears to be any publicity is better than none at all.

READ MORE: Brothers in alleged Jussie Smollett attack say they ‘regret’ being involved

Enter Jussie Smollett. On Jan. 29, we were told that Smollett was allegedly attacked near his Chicago apartment at 2 a.m. by two masked assailants. They poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him, wrapped a rope around his neck, and shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him.

Nearly a month later, on Feb. 20, Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false report after allegedly staging the outrageous attack against himself.

The following day, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson put Smollett under fire in an emotional press conference. “Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Johnson said. “I am left hanging my head asking, ‘Why? Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? … How can an individual who’s been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims?”

On Feb. 25, Johnson took to the media again, appearing on Good Morning America. He told host Robin Roberts that the Chicago police have more evidence against Smollett that has not yet been shared with the public, including “physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

Story continues below advertisement

Smollett has denied the criminal charges and maintains his innocence. But as more information in the Smollett case is revealed, we are left baffled, bewildered and much like Johnson, want an answer to the simple question — why?

In a 2011 interview with Palm Beach Post on his paper “Power, Fame, and Recovery,” U.S. psychiatrist Reef Karim said: “Little kids today don’t want to be doctors or lawyers. They just want to be famous.”

Social media has further exasperated this phenomenon, and now it’s not just kids but adults who are becoming addicted to fame at any cost — to themselves and society.

John McWhorter, a professor of linguistics at Columbia University has a theory on Smollett’s actions, building on the notion of fame, which he coins victimhood chic.

We are at a peculiar sociohistorical stage, where someone could think being black and jumped by white thugs makes them more interesting than being a star on a hit TV show. And sadly he’s right. (Did he not lie? I’m open, but …) https://t.co/yH8TY9TW0K — John McWhorter (@JohnHMcWhorter) February 20, 2019

What does it say about the society we live in if you can convince yourself that being the victim of a heinous racist and homophobic hate crime will make you more popular?

It’s a pretty twisted mentality, but the theory holds true — because Smollett was more popular — doing media interviews, trending online and garnering worldwide sympathy, from fellow actors to politicians and activists — for that brief moment before it all went south.

Donna Rockwell, a clinical psychologist who specializes in fame and celebrity, told The Hollywood Reporter that “one of the darkest corners of fame is that it becomes addictive and then you are so afraid of becoming a has-been or yesterday’s news that you might do something desperate.”

“There’s an incredible amount of pressure on people to stay relevant, to stay white hot in celebrity,” Rockwell said. In the case of Smollett, being in show business from childhood could have played a role, Rockwell added. “To just be a so-so actor isn’t enough. With child actors, this is embedded in their psyche from an early age. It would be more frightening to a child star than someone who didn’t start that young. They’re always afraid that this could be the end.”

As the weeks have passed, I have personally gone through a myriad of emotions with this case. Like many others, my immediate reaction was an almost visceral one. I was overwhelmed with feelings of sadness, fear and rage and held utmost sympathy and support for Smollett. It never crossed my mind that someone could make up something so vile. As the story has unfolded, I have felt embarrassed for being “duped” to later accepting that my reaction was a reasonable one in standing in support with a victim. Now I am simply saddened because hoax or not, the consequences on society are very real. I fear for even myself, whose natural inclination is to believe, because I may now subconsciously second-guess my gut because of this one highly publicized incident. And that is a terrible thing.

Dangerously so, the Smollett affair has put an undeserving spotlight on faked hate crimes. According to FBI statistics, there were 7,175 reported hate crimes in the U.S., of which just 23 were hoaxes. However, hate crimes are on the rise, up from 6,121 in 2016, part of a growing trend over the past five years.

Likewise in Canada, we have seen a steady climb in hate crimes since 2014, with numbers reaching an all-time high in 2017 of 2,073 (up 47 per cent over the previous year) largely driven by attacks targeting Muslim, Jewish and black people, according to Statistics Canada.

Whatever the outcome in the Smollett case, serious damage has been done. It has put a further rift in an already deeply divided United States. Moreover, it has detracted from the real hate crimes that are happening in America and here in Canada, with the risk of making victims even more reluctant to report these very real crimes than they already are. As Johnson expressed in the press conference on Feb. 21, “My concern is that hate crimes will be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn’t happen.”

There is no happy ending in this story. I don’t want Smollett to be the victim of such an ugly hate attack, nor do I want him to be so deranged in his quest for fame to have faked one. It has led to the harm of many others, and an ill fate for himself. I do hope it causes all of us to pause and reflect on how we are feeding into celebrity culture, because there is a very real and lasting cost to society that lingers long after that 15 minutes of fame is up.

We expect degrading attitudes toward our native lands to come from hostile countries, not from people within our own nation.

Yet that was exactly what happened last week when Bill Maher, host of the HBO show “Real Time,” went on a disparaging rant that picked at the scab that is the cultural and political divide of red state and blue state America.

Maher began by blaming Jeff Bezos for courting wealthy cities like New York for his next Amazon headquarters while ignoring states he said would benefit most from thousands of new jobs.

“That’s why red state voters are so pissed off,” he said. “They don’t hate us; they want to be us. They want to go the party. It’s like we’re the British royal family and they’re Meghan Markle’s dad.”

You might argue that is Maher being Maher and as an entertainer he’s just throwing red meat to satisfy his audience.

But two things are worth noting: The live audience applauded wildly at every insult he lobbed, and plenty of Americans think his jabs truly reflect how the blue-state cultural elite views people from red states.

Case in point: When the students from Covington Catholic got into an altercation with a progressive Native American activist, they were immediately judged guilty of heinous behavior before anyone had found out the facts. Why? Well, they were from Kentucky and had MAGA hats on. Jussie Smollett’s allegations of an attack by racist whites wearing MAGA hats was also immediately reported as true by the national press and celebrities, because they assumed that, of course, a Trump supporter would do that. Like Maher’s rant, they see Middle America as white, stupid, racist and filled with envy.

Many experts believe this attitude is what drove people to vote for Donald Trump in 2016. But many voters with red-state roots do not support Trump and take umbrage at Maher’s quip. They say his comments aren’t just a throwaway line from a comedian, but a real and growing problem for America — one that reinforces their distrust of the elite, continues to fuel the national divide, and has pushed them away from ever voting Democrat.

Ken Garner, a 56-year-old semi-retired attorney who lives in the very red state of Texas, says he enjoys the finer things in life: good food, museums, books, tasteful clothing, nice cars, high technology and classical music, “all the things that Maher claims only blue state people like.”

He says there is “not a shred of resentment as far as I can observe” from the people he meets across the Lone Star State towards those who live in blue states.

Garner doesn’t care much for the president, so much so that his Republican voting streak, which began in 1980, ended in the last presidential election when he decided not to cast a vote. But he’s also weary of the red-state bashing and says he gets why people who voted for Trump are also tired of it.

‘The reality is they love to look down on people who are not in their orbits.’

“I won’t vote for any Democrats,” he said.

Maher’s comments also ignore some startling facts. According to a recent Gallup poll, there are currently only six states where liberals outnumber conservatives: Massachusetts, Hawaii, Vermont, Washington, New York and New Hampshire.

Even in California, conservatives and liberals are split 29 percent to 29 percent, and in every other state, conservatives lead. Nationally, they outnumber liberals by nine percentage points.

Even people in the so-called blue states — such as Maine, Oregon, New Jersey and Illinois — don’t mostly identify as liberals. Comments like Maher’s fail to realize that blue staters don’t actually think as one. And many are increasingly put off by the idea that they do.

Kevin Oliver lives and works in the belly of the blue beast, the Washington DC Beltway. The 48-year-old business consultant and military reservist grew up in Winder, Georgia, and came here at the age of 32. He says he still maintains his red-state values, is a “constitutionalist” politically and doesn’t care much for Trump, but still, he feels the attitudes of people like Maher are wrong-headed and dangerous.

“The current left in America talks a great game about all people being equal, but the reality is they love to look down on people who are not in their orbits,” he said. “The elitism is sickening.”

And, with the elite tilting ever more left-wards, 2020 is already shaping up to be yet another disastrous year for Democrats.

The film premieres on HBO March 3 and 4. One person is suing HBO for implying that he was molested by the late pop star.

According to TMZ, Brett Barnes, who knew Jackson when he was child the doc “implies Jackson molested him as a boy. As for why Barnes thinks this … Wade Robson — one of Jackson’s well-known alleged victims — claims in the doc, Barnes ‘replaced him.’ The film then shows Michael and Brett together on tour. Thus, the insinuation.”

Barnes has threatened HBO with a lawsuit “claiming the documentary puts him in a false light and subjects him to ‘hatred, contempt and ridicule.’ Presumably, the lawyer is saying MJ supporters will target Barnes as a result of the documentary.”

Barnes testified at Jackson’s criminal trial in 2005 and said he was never assaulted by Jackson. He also tweeted this in January, “Not only do we have to deal with these lies, but we’ve also got to deal with people perpetuating these lies. The fact that they fail to do the small amount of research it takes to prove these are lies, by choice or not, makes it even worse.”

According to Rolling Stone, the film’s synopsis is described as “At the height of his stardom, Michael Jackson began long-running relationships with two boys, aged 7 and 10, and their families. Now in their 30s, they tell the story of how they were sexually abused by Jackson, and how they came to terms with it years later.”

Jackson’s estate told TMZ back in January, “This is yet another lurid production in an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in on Michael Jackson. The so-called documentary is just another rehash of dated and discredited allegations. It’s baffling why any credible filmmaker would involve himself with this project”.

In 1993, Jackson was accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy. In January of 1994, Jackson reportedly settled for $23,000,000. The accuser’s father committed suicide in 2009, five months after Jackson passed away. Jordan Chandler reportedly has never come forward about the allegations and supposedly lives outside of the country. In 2017, when choreographer Wade Robson accused Jackson of sexual assault—even though he’d said in the past the singer didn’t assault him—there was a hunt to find Chandler. According to The Daily Mail, he left the U.S. to avoid investigators.

In 2003, Jackson was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent to a 13-year-old boy. He was acquitted of all charges.

Jussie Smollett, a popular actor and singer-songwriter, was recently arrested and charged with filing a false police report.

Smollett alleged that he was attacked in late January by two white men who spewed racist and homophobic slurs as they assaulted him.

A standout detail was his claim that the assailants said, “This is MAGA country.” Smollett has been very critical of the Trump administration and said he believed this was some sort of retaliation.

Originally viewed as the victim, Smollett is now accused of orchestrating his own attack.

This has created an uproar. Smollett’s attack was a major news story, and a plethora of public figures expressed support for him. The public isn’t only shocked but also outraged by the latest accusations — especially survivors of hate crimes.

This situation hits close to home. Though I was never physically assaulted, I’ve been targeted for harassment due to my sexuality.

It’s been a challenging journey navigating between two crucial factors of my identity; I am both Black and gay. In the spring of 2015, a fake advertisement was posted on a college social app. The advertisement listed my college apartment number and was advertising for men to come over.

It was written as if it were a woman. I was gone at the time, but men began coming to my apartment looking for sex. My classmate who lived in my complex saw the ad and let me know.

It was embarrassing because other students had seen the ad. I contacted both campus security and the police. Nothing happened. I still have no closure on this incident.

In the fall of 2015, I was leaving class with a friend. A car followed us while its passengers yelled homophobic slurs at me, chasing me into a corner. This was caught on tape by security cameras.

I alerted campus security, and although they saw the clear visuals on the tape, nothing happened. Since it was a verbal bashing, they didn’t think it was a real threat (never mind my being chased by a car).

It was a Christian university. Since then, I’ve always wondered what they would do if I were a straight, white male who was verbally bashed and chased with evidence on tape.

Though both of these events left an impact, I’m lucky that it was no worse. Due to the current divisive state of our country, hate crimes have been on the rise across most categories.

In particular, there’s been a spike in hate crimes regarding race, religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The Human Rights Campaign reported that in 2017, 29 transgender individuals were brutally killed. This is the highest ever recorded — though the 26 transgender individuals murdered last year comes close.

In fact, hate crimes have been on the rise for three consecutive years, according to the FBI. As a Black man and a gay man — a member of two marginalized groups often targeted — this is a source of constant fear and anxiety.

Unlike Smollett’s case, which was an extremely rare case of possible false reporting, rights groups estimate that far more real incidents go unreported.

Hatred is still prevalent. Whether verbal or physical, these attacks are very real and can carry fatal outcomes. The Jussie Smollett episode shouldn’t distract us from this. One man may have lied, but the real story is how many lives are still threatened.

Please don’t stop supporting victims of hate crimes or advocating for justice.

Chicago police have announced that Jussie Smollett has been officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation for filing a false police report.

Detectives are currently gathering evidence to present to a Cook County Grand Jury, according to a tweet from Chicago police.

Smollett faces up to three years in prison if he’s convicted of the felony charges.

TMZ reports that the Osundairo brothers are expected to testify as soon as today.

This development comes just moments after surveillance video footage was released showing brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo at a store buying a number of items for the allegedly staged attack, including ski masks, gloves, bandanas, sunglasses and red hats."

For weeks, Empire star Jussie Smollett has kept up the narrative that he was viciously attacked in Chicago by pro-Trump supporters in an apparent hate crime. Now, local media reports claim that police investigating the incident believe that the whole thing was staged.

Chicago police raided the home of two “persons of interest” Wednesday night (Feb. 13), CBS Chicago reported. A relative of the “persons of interest,” two men, said police took bleach, shoes, electronics, receipts and other items from the home.

This information is according to family who says home was ransacked. I asked family why they think police picked the two brothers up for questioning and they replied by saying the men left for #Nigeria the day of the attack. @cbschicago — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) February 14, 2019

The two men, both of Nigerian descent, have appeared as extras on Empire, and their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, said that they both know Smollett.

“They do know Jussie,” she said. “They have worked with him on Empire. My preliminary investigations show that on set it’s very tight. They’re all very cordial with each other, so they’re baffled why they are people of interest.”

The relative who was home Wednesday night during the raid said she heard a loud banging at the door before the door came crashing down and officers burst in saying they had a search warrant.

The woman, who is in her 20s, said she was patted down by an officer and was asked if she knows Smollett. The unidentified woman said she was “so scared” she thought she was going to die. She said she was confused by what was going on, but did know Smollett was from the show.

The woman said she thinks police picked the two brothers up for questioning because of their loose connection to Smollett, and the men left for Nigeria the same day of the attack.

An attorney for the two men said they were visiting family in Nigeria and were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare airport Wednesday night. Police confirmed Smollett himself was also questioned at CPD Area Central Thursday.

According to ABC 7 Eyewitness News, police “are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of ‘Empire.'”

A spokesman for Chicago police, however, said those reports are unconfirmed, and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said they will continue to treat Jussie Smollett as a victim and the investigation remains ongoing.

Additionally, reps for Smollett said reports that he was being written off Empire are not true.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”"

Not too long after Chicago police announced that Jussie Smollett had been officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation for filing a false police report, the Empire actor was indicted by a Chicago grand jury and charged with a felony related to the ongoing investigation.

According to various news reports, the 36-year-old actor was hit with the indictment after grand jurors listened to testimonies and evaluated evidence.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that detectives would contact Smollett’s legal team “to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.”

Law enforcement sources said the two Nigerian brothers who were arrested in connection with the alleged hate crime attack, told police that Smollett hired them to stage the January 29th assault that has dominated news headlines over the past few weeks.

As we previously reported, Ola and Abel Osundairo were captured on surveillance video footage purchasing a bunch of supplies before the incident, including ski masks, gloves, bandanas, sunglasses, and red hats.

Even though police had officially classified Jussie as a “victim” early on the investigation, law enforcement sources said that Chicago police doubted the Empire actor’s story from the beginning.

According to TMZ, investigators said they found it weird that Smollett kept the rope around his neck for nearly an hour after the “attack,” and on top of that, their suspicions rose when he led them to the scene of the “crime” and quickly pointed out a camera that he said captured the alleged incident. As it turns out, TMZ reported, the camera was pointed in the wrong direction.

Abel and Ola Osundairo reportedly told police that in the days prior to the incident, they drove with Jussie to scout out a location and even rehearsed the “attack.” Law enforcement officials believe Jussie scheduled the “attack” for January 29th because he knew the Osundairo brothers would be leaving for Nigeria that day.

As for the hate mail letter allegedly sent to Jussie at Fox Studios in Chicago, Ola and Abel said they had nothing to do with that, but admitted to seeing it in a photo on Jussie’s phone.

Meanwhile, the FBI is running tests to see if the postage stamp on the letter matches stamps police seized at the Osundairo brothers’ home and if the ripped out magazine pages found at their house matches the cut-out letters that were used.

According to Illinois law, filing a false police report is disorderly conduct and a class 4 felony that is punishable by a minimum of one to three years in prison."

The alleged racist and homophobic-fueled hate crime against Empire actor Jussie Smollett has rocked the Internet and shaken the nation.

Many people are eager for the alleged MAGA-loving thugs to be held accountable for the assault. So when the Chicago Police announced on Twitter that after scouring surveillance footage, they’d be releasing photos of some “persons of interest” in the case, people were READY for justice to be served.

Unfortunately, what we were greeted with from the Chicago PD was about as helpful in solving this case as sending someone to find a needle in a haystack.

Jim Wilson / The New York Times

SAN FRANCISCO — The University of California Police Department on Friday arrested a suspect in the assault of a conservative activist on the Berkeley campus, reviving a debate over free speech at colleges.

Neither the suspect, Zachary Greenberg, nor the man he is accused of punching, Hayden Williams, a field representative of the Leadership Institute, an organization that provides training to conservative campus groups, was a student at the university.

The attack Feb. 19 took place at Sproul Plaza, the birthplace and symbol of the Free Speech movement, the protests by students in the 1960s demanding greater political expression. Williams was helping a campus group that was recruiting members.

Conservative groups said the assault on Williams served as a symbol of what they say is continued intolerance toward conservative views on college campuses. Williams appeared on Fox News programs with a black eye, and videos of his assault were widely shared on social media.

The episode was only a faint echo of the brawl at the Berkeley campus in February 2017 when a group clad in black clothing and carrying sticks smashed windows, threw rocks at police and stormed a building in response to a planned speech by right-wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos, causing around $100,000 in damage.

In an interview, Williams said he and the students he was seeking to train had made signs supporting President Donald Trump and criticizing Jussie Smollett, an actor who has been charged in connection with his own assault in Chicago. One of the signs said, “This is MAGA country,” Williams said.

Two men are seen in multiple videos of the episode approaching Williams, who begins filming them. One man points to the signs and accuses Williams of “encouraging violence.”

A man is then seen pushing Williams, showering him with expletives and delivering a powerful right hook to his face.

A university spokeswoman said campus police would present the case to the Alameda County district attorney for the filing of criminal charges.

In a statement, Carol Christ, chancellor of the university, called the attack “reprehensible.”

“That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here,” the chancellor said. “Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.”

Bryan Bernys, head of the Campus Leadership Program at the Leadership Institute, accused the Berkeley campus of encouraging “a culture that fosters this type of horrible behavior toward anyone or anything that you disagree with.”

The Leadership Institute runs a website called Campus Reform, which says it “exposes the liberal bias and abuse against conservatives on America’s colleges and universities.”

“What does it say about Berkeley that this gentleman felt that he could go up and basically sucker-punch or cold-cock Hayden in the middle of a public square for no other reason than he disagreed with some of his speech and the signs that were out there,” Bernys said.

Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for the university, described Greenberg as a “lone actor.”

“Many people seem to think that somehow this university of all places should have the ability to prevent all crime even when it’s the responsibility of a lone, crazy individual,” Mogulof said.

As a measure of its commitment to ideological pluralism, Mogulof said the university spent $4 million last year for security and logistics to host conservative speakers, among them Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator and presidential candidate; Dennis Prager, a conservative talk show host; and Heather Mac Donald, a conservative writer and political commentator."

New video shows the two men who say Jussie Smollett hired them to stage the alleged hate crime attack buying a bunch of items they used during the incident.

The newly released surveillance footage, obtained by CBS2 in Chicago, shows what appears to be Ola and Abel Osundairo at the checkout counter ringing up ski masks, gloves, bandanas, sunglasses and red hats.

Police said Smollett claimed two men wearing a similar hat and masks attacked him on January 29th in Chicago. The Osundairo brothers were arrested last Wednesday, but were released without charges Friday.

Sources have said the two brothers, who are actors and appeared as extras on Empire, told investigators they helped stage the attack with Smollett. They said the Empire actor paid them $3,500 to assault him, pour bleach on him, and place a rope around his neck, all while yelling racist and homophobic slurs.

Sources said at least one of the brothers purchased the rope used in the incident, which was Smollett’s idea. The sources also said Smollett paid for the rope, which was bought at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store the weekend of January 25th, just a few days before the attack.

One of the brothers is said to have held the rope and poured the bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled the slurs at Smollett, sources said. The brothers reportedly told detectives that the attack was supposed to happen before January 29th and they, along with Smollett, rehearsed the attack days before it happened.

Smollett vehemently denies staging the incident, however.

Meanwhile, 21th Century Fox has repeatedly denied rumors that Smollett was being written off Empire.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” a Fox spokesperson stated.

One of the things about family is that you definitely don’t choose them and you most certainly can’t control them.

Drake’s daddy is a rogue, pimpin’ soul from Memphis. But who knew he was pals with R. Kelly and Jussie Smollett?

According to an interview in Variety, Aubrey’s father is not only friends with two of Black America’s Most Wanted, but he’s also a staunch defender of both men who have pretty much been successfully tried in the court of public opinion and social media.

Drake’s Dad on R.Kelly:

“He’s a good friend of mine. I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100%.”

Drake’s Dad on Jussie Smollett:

“Jussie has been misunderstood. As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.”

Now here’s what I’m trying to figure out: When the hell did Drake’s daddy become friends with R. Kelly and Jussie Smollett?!?

R. Kelly, I can kind of see since they’re closer in age. But what events was Papa Dennis going to that he would run into Jussie, of all people? Drake never made a guest star appearance on Empire so it’s not like he met Jussie through his son.

And furthermore, when have either of them had the time to update Dennis on their criminal/legal situations for him to say that R. Kelly has his support 100% or that the police got Jussie’s story all wrong? Cause there’s no way I’m believing that Drake’s old pimp juice daddy is on speed dial for either Lying Ass Jussie or Pee-Pee Pedophile Robert.

Can Drake please help his daddy pick out better friends? And also, it might be a good idea to hook Dennis up with a real PR person because that Variety interview is a hot ghetto mess and that single of his, “That on That,” is some nonsensical trash that should’ve never seen the light of day."

Smollett has claimed that the $3,500 check that he wrote to the brothers disproved the claims of a staged attack, as it read “5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go” on the memo line. Smollett’s laywers are expected to present the check at trial to create reasonable doubt.

Abimbola ‘Abel’ Osundairo and Olabinjo Ola Osundairo have spoken of their “tremendous regret” at being involved in the scandal and said sorry for the negative impact they may have had on other people, particularly those who have been victims of hate crimes.

A statement issued by their attorney to CBS Chicago read: “My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.”

The Empire actor told police in January that he had been attacked by two masked men in Chicago, who had abused him with racist and homophobic language, doused him with a chemical substance, and tied a rope around his neck.

The two brothers – who knew Jussie from working on Empire and attending the same gym – were arrested last month but were released after telling police about the alleged hoax.

Authorities believe that the 36-year-old actor paid the men to stage the attack to draw attention to himself in a bid to get a salary increase, but he has denied the claims.

Jussie was arrested last month on felony charges of filing a false police report and disorderly conduct and ordered to pay a US$10,000 bond and surrender his passport.

His character, Jamal Lyon, was subsequently dropped from the final two episodes of the current season of Empire in order to “avoid further disruption” to the show.

The actor has been praised by his legal team as a “young man of impeccable character” in a statement that hit out at the way the investigation has been handled.

The lawyers said in a statement: “Today we witnessed an organised law-enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr Smollett and, notably, on the eve of a mayoral election.

“Mr Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

It is currently not clear if the Osundairo brothers will face any charges."

The University of California Police Department said in a statement that officers responded Tuesday afternoon to a “report of a disturbance” on upper Sproul Plaza, a center of student activity on campus, where they found the injured victim. An investigation is continuing, the university said Friday.

According to the police statement, the victim said that two men approached him, a verbal altercation ensued and he began recording the interaction on his phone.

One of the men “slapped the phone out of the victim’s hand,” police said. “The suspect then knocked over the table the victim was at and the two men struggled over the phone. During the incident, the suspect punched the victim several times causing injury to the victim’s eye and nose.”

Turning Point USA later identified the alleged victim to CNN as Hayden Williams, who had been invited to UC Berkeley to help recruit students for a yet-to-be-formed chapter on campus.

A media representative for Williams said he is a field representative for the Leadership Institute, an organization that helps train conservative leaders. Williams is not a UC Berkeley student, the representative said.

“The fact that the victim was not a campus affiliate has no bearing on this case. He had every right to be on campus, and every right to express his point of view,” said campus spokesman Dan Mogulof.

On Friday, the campus police department said in a statement it had identified the suspect as Zachary Greenberg, who was arrested and booked. UC police said it would present the case to the “Alameda County District Attorney’s Office for consideration of the filing of criminal charges.” No further information on Greenberg was given.

The department’s information indicated “the suspect is not a student at, or affiliate of the University.”

Violence was ‘disheartening,’ student says

Williams told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Thursday that some students were upset by a sign he had displayed at his recruitment table that said, “Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims” — apparently a reference to “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who has been accused of staging what he maintains was a hate crime against him.

“This person claimed we were promoting violence on campus and proceeded to take his aggression out on us,” Williams told Hannity.

A short video recorded by a witness shows Williams and a man struggling before the man punches Williams in the face, knocking his hat off. The alleged suspect then gets close to Williams’ face, calls him “racist,” and shouts profanities before punching Williams again and walking away.

Williams told CNN he is fine but declined to answer other questions. He was treated at the scene, his media representative said.

Arda Erbil, the student who shot the footage provided to CNN, said he saw two men harassing Williams. As one of the men became physical, Erbil began to record video.

“Seeing something like that happen in such an open place was disheartening,” he said.

UC Berkeley’s chancellor and vice chancellor condemned the assault in a statement Thursday, calling it “reprehensible.”

“That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here,” the statement said. “Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.”

The statement added that university officials have “no information indicating” the perpetrators are affiliated with UC Berkeley.

School has history of protests against conservatives

The incident illustrates the “hate and anger so many on the left harbor and that our student activists encounter on a daily basis,” Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA’s founder and president, said in a statement Thursday.

“Our amazing grassroots organizers courageously face threats of violence and discrimination as they fight for the right for conservative voices to be heard on college campuses,” Kirk said, adding he was proud of how the group’s student activists handled the situation.

UC Berkeley’s campus has had a number of incidents in recent years involving the protesting of conservative commentators and personalities.

In 2017, a number of protests broke out ahead of speaking engagements by conservative commentators such as Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter. Neither of those events went forward.

Later that year, conservative radio host Ben Shapiro gave a talk as protesters swarmed outside. Nine people were arrested, but the protests appeared to be mostly peaceful."

Zachary Greenberg, 28, was arrested on a warrant on Friday at in Berkeley, California, following a 10-day search, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

He was held on $30,000 bail in Alameda County jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon likely to produce great bodily injury for the attack on Hayden WiIliams on February 19.

He is to be arraigned on Monday at the Wiley W. Manuel Courthouse in Oakland.

Neither Greenberg or Williams are students at the University of California-Berkeley.

In a statement to Campus Reform, Williams expressed his view of the news of his attacker's arrest:

'I am grateful to the University of California Berkeley Police Department for its dedication to identifying and arresting the man who attacked me. But while this is a moment for celebration, I remain disappointed by the UC Berkeley Administration, which allowed a culture of intolerance and violence toward conservatives to grow. I hope UC Berkeley’s leadership will seize on this moment-in-time to take deliberate steps to establish a zero tolerance policy when it comes to violence, and restore Berkeley’s legacy as ‘Home of the Free Speech Movement.'

Video from the incident shows Williams (left) being confronted by a violent attacker who punched him in the face as he was recruiting for a conservative student group

Williams was running a campus recruitment table for Turning Points USA, a conservative activist group, when he was approached by his attacker in Sproul Plaza.

The sign on the table read 'hate crime hoaxes hurt real victims,' a reference to the Jussie Smollett the bias incident allegedly staged by the actor himself in Chicago.

The suspect shouted: 'Mother f**ker. You racist little inbred b***h. C**t!'

UC-Berkeley campus police said that the attack took place at 3.29pm on Upper Sproul Plaza, and that two men initially approached the table confronting Williams.

'A physical confrontation ensued when one of the two men slapped the phone out of the victim’s hand,' the police statement said.

While the rest of the world is recoiling in horror from the allegations of rampant child sexual abuse leveled against Michael Jackson in the documentary “Leaving Neverland” (8 p.m. Sunday and Monday, HBO), it’s largely busines as usual in Las Vegas.

Billboards tout the celebration of Jackson’s hits in the tribute concert “MJ Live” at the Stratosphere.

The 10-foot statue of a militaristic Jackson created as a promotion for his 1995 album “HIStory” still stands on a pedestal in the lobby of Mandalay Bay. The resort also houses the Cirque du Soleil production “Michael Jackson One,” while the accompanying Jackson-themed boutique displays the jacket the singer wore to the 1984 American Music Awards as well as a pair of loafers and the Swarovski crystal-covered socks he performed in during the “Dangerous” world tour.

One entertainment booking website lists 19 Michael Jackson impersonators based in Las Vegas. Several of them, somehow, have glowing reviews from their performances at children’s parties.

Two sides

“He was one of the kindest, most gentle, loving, caring people I knew,” choreographer Wade Robson says of Jackson in “Leaving Neverland’s” opening moments. “He helped me tremendously, helped me with my career. He helped me with my creativity, with all of those sorts of things. And he also sexually abused me for seven years.”

Much like Lifetime’s “Surviving R. Kelly,” which took damning claims of molestation and underage sex that had been floating around for years and packaged them into a sensational documentary, the two-part “Leaving Neverland” doesn’t so much break new ground as pummel viewers into submission with painfully graphic details of abuse.

Robson first made his accusations public in May 2013, when he filed a $1.5 billion lawsuit against Jackson’s estate. James Safechuck, the other alleged victim profiled in the documentary, filed a similar suit the following year. Both were dismissed in 2017 on procedural grounds without a ruling on the credibility of the claims.

Long ties to Las Vegas

Jackson’s ties to Las Vegas date back to at least 1974, when the then-15-year-old singer began performing with his siblings at the original MGM Grand. During those trips, he befriended magicians Siegfried & Roy, who also were performing at the hotel. Fifteen years later, Jackson co-wrote and recorded “Mind Is the Magic,” the theme song for the duo’s show at The Mirage.

According to Review-Journal stories from the time, Jackson hung out at the resort for several weeks before it opened to the public in November 1989. “We have been lucky enough to have Michael Jackson work on design elements and attractions,” Steve Wynn announced at The Mirage the next spring during an appearance with the singer.

Jackson became something of a regular guest at the hotel over the years. He and Wynn grew so close — in a detail that only grows darker with time considering the multiple sexual misconduct allegations leveled against both men — the casino magnate was listed by the defense as a possible character witness in Jackson’s 2005 molestation trial.

That was the same court proceeding during which Robson testified Jackson never acted inappropriately around him.

Meeting Michael Jackson

Robson was 5 years old and living in Brisbane, Australia, when his mother brought home a VHS copy of the making of Jackson’s “Thriller” video. “Once I saw that tape, everything changed for me,” he says in “Leaving Neverland.”

The boy began replicating those dance moves and started dressing like the singer. Robson soon won a dance contest at a Target store for the chance to meet Jackson during a concert in Brisbane. Two years later in 1990, during a trip to California, Robson and his family went out of their way to reconnect with the singer and visited him at his sprawling Neverland Ranch.

“Like, for me to look back on the scenario now, what you’d think would be standard kind of instincts and judgment seemed to go out the window,” Robson says in the film. After two days, everyone else went to the Grand Canyon, leaving the 7-year-old Robson alone with Jackson for the rest of the week. That, he alleges, is when the abuse began.

Safechuck, meanwhile, says he was never really a fan of Jackson before he was hired to appear with him in a Pepsi commercial. In the now haunting ad, the boy sneaks into Jackson’s dressing room, tries on some clothes and dances a bit before he’s surprised by the singer’s arrival. Smiling in the doorway, Jackson practically coos, “Lookin’ for me?”

According to the documentary, Jackson began spending the night at the Safechucks’ home in Simi Valley, California. That summer, the family went on tour with him. Safechuck, who would have been 10 at the time, stayed with Jackson while his parents were assigned hotel rooms farther and farther away. During a stop in Paris, he says Jackson started molesting him and making him practice getting dressed as fast as possible in case anyone came to their room.

Valley sightings

That 2005 trial, 11 years after Jackson settled similar allegations out of court, interrupted a stretch during which the singer called Las Vegas home.

He became a regular visitor in 2002, hitting up the Forum Shops at Caesars seven times in 10 days that fall and, the Review-Journal reported at the time, taking a private 2 a.m. tour of the Guggenheim Hermitage Museum at The Venetian along with six children, two nannies and two bodyguards.

Jackson received the key to the city from Mayor Oscar Goodman in October 2003, while he was the subject of a police investigation. He was backstage at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace to see Celine Dion on Nov. 8 that year, 12 days before he flew from North Las Vegas to Santa Barbara, California, to surrender to authorities.

Hours later, after posting bail, Jackson returned, embarking on a winding, nearly three-hour rolling street party that was televised live on CNN. Fans and curious onlookers darted into traffic to get closer to the singer as he meandered from Henderson Executive Airport to Green Valley Ranch.

As odd as that convoy was, Jackson’s next stint in Las Vegas, following his acquittal and more than a year spent overseas, was downright surreal.

Arriving with his children on Christmas Eve 2006, Jackson became a fixture around town over the next two years while living at the Palms, in Summerlin, in Spanish Trail and, finally, in a 1.7-acre compound on Palomino Lane that has become known as the Thriller Villa.

Jackson sightings appeared frequently in the pages of the Review-Journal, chronicling his moviegoing habits (“Night at the Museum” at Red Rock, “Kung Fu Panda” at the Palms), dining excursions (Planet Hollywood restaurant at Caesars, Benihana at the Las Vegas Hilton) and other outings, including trips to see “Bodies … The Exhibition” and “Tournament of Kings.”

He reportedly attended UFC 84 at the MGM Grand, seated in a wheelchair, with black fabric covering his face.

Legacy in peril?

A little more than a year later, on June 25, 2009, Jackson was pronounced dead.

“I danced when I heard he had died,” Safechuck’s mother, Stephanie, declares in the film.

As powerful and harrowing as the claims of Robson and Safechuck are — the latter alleges Jackson arranged a wedding ceremony for the two, complete with rings, and that he was regularly bribed with jewelry to participate in sex acts — “Leaving Neverland” is being released amid near daily updates in the bewildering case of Jussie Smollett.

Jackson, obviously, isn’t around to defend himself, and there’s precious little of his side to be found in the four-hour documentary. Robson and Safechuck, though, will get yet another hour of prime-time television when “Oprah Winfrey Presents: After Neverland” debuts at 10 p.m. Monday on HBO and OWN.

Had Jackson never relocated to Las Vegas, though, he may still have been alive to refute every charge. After all, this is where the singer met local cardiologist Dr. Conrad Murray, who eventually became his personal physician and was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death.

There’s no telling how the many stomach-turning accusations will be received by the public — whether outrage will leave the singer’s reputation as damaged as R. Kelly’s, or if viewers will simply shrug the whole thing off as a desperate money grab.

For now, though, Jackson’s career is alive and well.

For now, the King of Pop still reigns.

At least in Las Vegas.

Cardi B says she’s “really disappointed in Jussie Smollett” because she feels like “he f**ked up Black History month.”

On January 29th, Smollett, who stars on the hit Fox show Empire, told Chicago police that he was assaulted by two masked men who beat him, poured a chemical substance on him, placed a rope around his neck, and shouted at him: “This is MAGA country!” The Chicago Police Department investigated the alleged attack as a “possible hate crime” because Smollett told them that the men screamed racial and homophobic slurs at him.

But in mid-February, which just so happens to be Black History Month, Smollett’s story began to unravel as the Chicago PD released more details about the alleged attack. The two men in the alleged assault were apparently friends of Jussie, police said, and they were paid by the actor to stage a hate crime so that Smollett could get a pay raise on Empire.

Cardi B does this thing where she says what everyone is thinking, but doesn’t want to say it out loud, and, if Jussie Smollett really did lie to us about being attacked, Cardi pretty much nailed it right on the head with this one.

“I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett,” she said on Instagram Live last Monday (Feb. 18). “I feel like he f**ked up Black History Month, bro.”

Cardi, however, is still holding on to hope that Jussie is somehow telling the truth and he’s simply being framed as a liar by Chicago police.

“Like, damn. I’m not gonna say, yet. Until he say it out his mouth that it was fake and the sh*t was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him, because somebody I was talking to they said police in Chicago are racists,” she said. “So they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar. But if he’s not, then bro you f**ked up, for real.”

“Like, why would you do that?” the Grammy Award winner asked. “Then you give f**king Donald Trump immunity to laugh at n***as and sh*t, to make motherf**kas look bad. This sh*t crazy, girl.”

Jussie Smollett, for his part, has maintained his initial story and even referred to himself as the “Gay Tupac” when he addressed a crowd at a concert following the incident.

He was arrested on Thursday (Feb. 21) and spent a few hours in Cook County Jail before paying $10,000 bond on a $100K bail to be released.

After leaving jail, he went straight to the Chicago set of Empire where he was met with a group of angry cast and crew members who later told producers that they didn’t want him a part of the show anymore.

Fox announced last week that Smollett’s character had been written out of the final two episodes of the current season, and there are reports that he could possibly be replaced by a new actor next season. Empire is currently in its fifth season, which comes back from hiatus on Wednesday, March 13th."

Jussie Smollett was released from the custody of Chicago police Thursday afternoon (Feb. 21) after posting $100,000 bail.

The Empire star looked pathetic as he did the walk of shame from Cook County jail and was swarmed by the media before leaving in a black SUV.

According to TMZ, during his arrest, Smollett told police he has a drug problem that’s never been treated, which could become relevant later in the case because cops said Jussie bought ecstasy from Abel Olundairo.

“IF he were convicted, a drug issue could be a mitigating factor that gets his sentenced reduced,” TMZ reported.

Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police early Thursday morning after he was indicted on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for filing a police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs at him and looped a rope around his neck.

It was later revealed that the actor paid two men $3,500 to help him stage the attack because he was unhappy with his Empire salary.

Jussie Smollett faces up to three years in jail if convicted."

Now that it’s been confirmed that Jussie Smollett’s lied his ass off about being attacked by Trump supporters, we knew it wouldn’t be long before comedians started parodying the whole situation. And first up is The Daily Show with Trevor Noah.

The Daily Show, which airs weeknights on Comedy Central, put together a fake Lifetime-esque movie trailer mocking Jussie’s “attack” and how it came to be, starring look-a-like Jaboukie Young-White as Smollett.

.@jaboukie has some thoughts on Jussie Smollett: pic.twitter.com/0CJdKHjz6I — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) February 20, 2019

The hilarious trailer takes viewers through every stage of Smollett’s staged attack, from him being insulted after he was given $60,000 for working “three days this week” to not being taken seriously after creating a fake death-threat letter that says “I’m going to kill me,” to plotting out the hoax with his Nigerian trainer friends, and eventually clumsily carrying the fake attack out.

The trailer even features a dramatic shot of a Subway sandwich falling to the ground. And in the end, Jussie (Jaboukie) holds a rope as he looks into the camera and says “I’m the gay Tupac.” Pure hilarity all around, tbh.

Jussie Smollett was arrested Thursday and charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He was released on $100,000 bond and faces up to three years in jail if convicted. He still maintains his innocence."

President Donald Trump weighed in on Jussie Smollett’s arrest Thursday, calling the actor out for making “racist and dangerous comments” and insulting “tens of millions of people.”

The Empire star turned himself in to Chicago police early Thursday morning to face a felony charge of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. During a press conference after his arrest, Chicago police said Smollett staged his attack because he was “dissatisfied” with his Empire salary.

Trump’s Twitter fingers went to work this morning after Smollett’s arrest. He wrote: “.@JussieSmollett – what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA”

.@JussieSmollett – what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2019

In his initial report about the incident, Smollett claimed that his attackers yelled “MAGA,” a reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan. The actor also claimed his attackers poured bleach on him, put a noose around his neck and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

Trump was asked about the alleged attack on January 31st, two days after it happened, and said: “I can tell you that it’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse.”

Smollett has been attacking the president and his supporters for years. In one post from January 20th, he called Trump “and all his white cohorts” a “national disgrace.”

“And if you support them … so are you. Clowns,” he wrote along with a video showing far-left lawmaker Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) speaking.

The week before the attack, Smollett posted a video on Instagram showing the front of the Trump hotel in Chicago while Ice Cube’s “Arrest the President” song played in the background.

In Smollett’s Good Morning America interview that aired the day before the men who police say helped the actor stage the attack were arrested and held for questioning, Smollett claimed that he was targeted because he’s critical of Trump.

“I come really, really hard against 45,” Smollett told Robin Roberts. “I come really really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”"

The FBI is disputing the Chicago Police Department’s claim that Jussie Smollett sent a threatening hate letter to himself before allegedly staging his January 29th attack with Nigerian brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo.

According to TMZ, the FBI says they don’t know who wrote that letter because they’re still investigating. Meanwhile, Jussie says that the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel Osundairo was for training and not to stage a hate crime attack.

Via TMZ:

TMZ has obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the “attack.” The memo line reads, “5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.” Sources connected to Jussie tell us, the reference to “Don’t Go” is a song for which Jussie was going to shoot a music video … featuring himself shirtless. The sources say Jussie had gained weight — he was 192 lbs and needed to lose 20 pounds for the shoot, and that’s why he hired Abel … whom he says he calls “Bon.” There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the “attack” — Bon wrote, “I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.” Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, “This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.” You also see a text showing a calendar where February 23 is marked “Don’t Go.” The sources say that’s the date of the music video shoot. There’s another screenshot from Sept. 27, 2018, presumably showing Jussie has paid Ola in the past. It’s a Venmo payment of $100 to Bola (Abimbola aka Abel) for “Training.” Sources connected to Jussie say the $3,500 breakdown is as follows — $600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks. As we reported, Ola and Abel also told the grand jury the payment was for training. This is not proof the attack wasn’t staged, but in a trial, all the defense has to do is create reasonable doubt, and we’re told the Police Superintendent’s pronouncement will become a defense weapon if the case goes to trial. The Police Superintendent also said during the news conference Jussie himself sent the racist letter 8 days before the attack. Federal law enforcement sources tell us they have not concluded who wrote the letter … at least not yet.

Here’s a picture of Jussie Smollett’s check to Abel Osundairo:

And below are screenshots of various text message exchanges about diet and fitness in the days leading up to the alleged attack:

And here’s the screenshot of a $100 Venmo transaction from Sept. 27, 2018 for “Training”:

Also, here’s a video from Abel’s YouTube channel called “Fat to Fit in 2 Months.”

What the hell is going on? Is the Chicago PD lying on Jussie about that check? And if so, why would they do that? They’re looking really shady right now because they’re the ones who put it out there that the check was for helping Jussie stage the attack.

Almost every single day, this story either changes or has a new development. Are you as tired as we are? Because we’re tired. This is hella draining."

Producers for Empire announced early Friday (Feb. 22) that Jussie Smollett’s character Jamal Lyon would not appear in the final two episodes of the show after his cast mates made it clear that they want nothing to do with him after his arrest for lying to police about being attacked by racist, homophobic Trump supporters.

And now, reports suggest producers for the hit Fox series are considering bringing in a new actor to replace Smollett instead of simply writing his character out of the show.

According to TV Line, showrunner Lee Daniels—who loosely based the Jamal Lyon character on his own life—is a “strong proponent of the recast option.”

Fox said in a statement earlier today about Smollett’s Season 5 ousting: “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Fox added that Lee Daniels and his team of executive producers—including Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo, and Dennis Hammer—all agreed that it would be best to remove Jussie from the Season 5 finale.

Smollett, who has played Jamal Lyon on the Fox drama since its debut four years ago in January 2015, was turned himself in to Chicago police Thursday after he was hit with a felony criminal charge of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report in connection to last month’s alleged hate crime attack.

Chicago police said in a press conference Thursday that Smollett paid two men, Nigerian brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, to stage the attack because he was unhappy with his Empire salary.

After leaving Cook County jail Thursday on $100k bond, Smollett went straight to the Empire set and apologized to everyone, but maintained his innocence.

TMZ reported that Smollett changed his number “because certain pissed off cast members were blowing up his phone,” and he only gave his new number out to the people who still support him.

Not long after his arrest Thursday, the actor’s legal team released a statement saying: “Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”"

Prosecutors have released not-so-shocking new details in the Jussie Smollett case following his arrest for lying to police.

According to the court documents, obtained by TMZ, Smollett sent a text to Abel and Ola Osundairo four days before the staged attack, then met with them to go over details.

Prosecutors also said Smollett “received” the now-infamous hate mail letter, which contained homophobic and racial epithets, on January 22nd at the Chicago studio where Empire is shot.

TMZ has the details below:

The letter contained an “unknown white powdery substance.” It would appear that was intended to make people think it was Anthrax or some other dangerous chemical … but prosecutors say it turned out to be crushed Ibuprofen. Then on January 25, Jussie fires off the text to Abel Osundairo, saying … “Might need your help on the low. You around to meet up and talk face to face?” Cops say Abel and Jussie had been friends since the fall of 2017, and that Jussie sometimes scored ecstasy from him. Later on the 25th, they did meet face to face outside Abel’s Chicago apartment and talked in Jussie’s car about staging the attack. Cops say this is when Ola was brought onboard. The original plan, according to cops, was for Ola to place a rope around Jussie’s neck, pour gasoline on him and yell, “This is MAGA country.” At that point, they say Jussie gave them a $100 bill to go purchase necessary items for the “attack.” On January 27, they meet again and drive around Chicago to scout locations. Cops say Smollett told them to leave their cell phones and pointed out the surveillance cam near Jussie’s residence that he believed would record the incident. They made a late change from gasoline to bleach — although cops don’t say why — and Smollett also handed them the $3,500 check payable to Abel and backdated to Jan. 23. As we’ve reported, Jussie noted in the memo line that the check was for training. On January 28, the brothers bought the materials and Abel deposited the check. Now to the “attack” … at 12:49 AM, on January 29, cops say there was a 3-minute call between Smollett and Abel, and Jussie told him the “attack” would go down at exactly 2 AM. As you know, the Osundairos boarded a flight for Nigeria later on the 29th — but police say Jussie spoke to Abel on Jan. 30. They say Jussie called him for 8 minutes and 48 seconds, while Abel was in Turkey. And, there’s this … you’ll recall Smollett’s camp told TMZ the day of the attack, he believed his attackers were white. Cops say he also told them, “he could see that the area around this person’s eyes was white-skinned.”

Whew chile, this whole thing has turned into a HUGE mess!"

A correspondent with military intel credentials writes: “[Eric] Hoffer’s observation that people only revolt when things are getting better seems applicable to DPRK. I can only assume that Kim and his cabal in NK know this or somehow instinctively understand it. In short, as I see it, he can’t afford to let things get really better for North Korean people. So, I believe Trump’s carrot of great economic success for DPRK’s people probably scares Kim badly.”

It was certainly hard to imagine the two leaders in conversation: The President with his larval vocabulary and Mr. Kim in his life-long solipsistic haze. Perhaps they compared hair-dos, both equally strange, would you not admit? Something tells me that Mr. Kim is not a golfer, so that was out as an icebreaker, though it’s said he does enjoy firing artillery at human targets — one thing that Mr. Trump has not been accused of by former consiglieri-turned-pagliaccio Michael Cohen. Perhaps Mr. Trump let Mr. Kim in on the glorious beauty of an American Cheeseburger, a sure-nuff wonder of the world!

The Fall of the Ancien... james howard kunstler Buy New $7.00 (as of 06:00 EST - Details) In any case, the US president trundled home without nailing that ole coonskin to the wall, as one of his predecessors put it, but the game isn’t over. For now, it’s back to war on the home front against the armies of Wokesterdom. That movement appears to be floundering a bit too now as Jussie Smollett whirls down the memory hole, and #MeToo sputters, and the various congressional committees scrape the bottom of every barrel for the always-elusive triumphal “gotcha” in their crusade to correct the 2016 election. The fishy barrel that Michael Cohen came out of provided disappointingly thin sludge, so now The New York Times (official playbill of Wokesterdom) informs us that next up they’ll be hauling Mr. Trump’s financial officer, one Allen Weisselberg, into the star chamber for a ‘splainin’ session. Pretty soon, they’ll make the amazing discovery that the New York City construction scene is run by the mob. Won’t that be a revelation?

Let’s face it, March is a month that drips with fraughtness. Everybody is good and goddam sick of winter, yet it lingers sadistically, not unlike the Mueller investigation. Then, you get to the middle of the month and what’s there? The sinister Ides, an age-old ceremonial turning point of the year recognized by the ancients even before Julius Caesar got whacked in the Roman senate. I propose that mid-March this year will be the occasion of so many shoes dropping that Washington will look like a road show of Shuffle Along.

Everybody and his/her/zhe/they’s uncle expects Mr. Mueller to cast down his report from on high. In a non-Bizarro world it would be a catalog of indictments for most of the FBI executive leadership circa 2016-2018, and a few cherries-on-top from the DOJ, CIA, and the DNC. More likely, it will be a stuffed, roasted rump of innuendo drenched in Russian dressing garnished with rinky-dink “process” crime convictions. One way or another, it’s sure to disappoint the minions of Wokesterdom.

The Law of the Jungle:... Kunstler, James Howard Best Price: $8.62 Buy New $7.50 (as of 09:10 EST - Details) But once that’s out of the way, more interesting action may be in the offing. Mr. Trump, despite all the Twitter bluster, has at least patiently held back on declassifying reams of documents pertaining to official misconduct by many of the investigators themselves, perhaps even Mr. Mueller and some of his colleagues. I expect a steady and measured release of that classified material, and it will tell a tale that may even startle the Wokesters out of their dark raptures.

Nobody knows exactly what the new attorney general, Mr. Barr, might do. So far, he has not done anything. I will be surprised if that continues. He is probably also waiting for the Mueller report before he starts dispatching folks to grand juries, perhaps even a former president, and certainly some of his foot-servants and handmaidens. Upcoming too are actions by the DOJ inspector general, Mr. Horowitz, federal prosecutor John Huber’s forgotten commission, and the reappearance of General Flynn in Judge Sullivan’s DC courtroom.

March is also looking like the moment when the financial world starts rockin’ and rollin’ on the recognition that the global economy has stalled. The fantasy of economic triumph is the one float that the Golden Golem of Greatness has been able to parade around on. Both the real estate markets and the car business have gone south now, and the financial entanglements entailed by them, in the form of securitized mortgages and loans, are janky enough to start blowing up pension funds, insurance companies, and state treasuries just for starters. The complacency on Wall Street ought to be a prime signal for the sentient to duck-and-cover.

Before Greenberg’s arrest, the Berkeley chancellor released a statement condemning the incident. “According to the police, an unknown, unidentified assailant attacked a Berkeley student engaged in political advocacy. Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason,” it read, in part. Authorities now say that once unidentified assailant was Greenberg.

The February 2019 attack against conservative activist Hayden Williams was captured on video that went viral. Greenberg is now facing felony accusations.

Here’s what you need to know:

1. UC-Berkeley Released Greenberg’s Name & Said He was Booked Into the Jail

Zachary Greenberg’s name was released by the UC-Berkeley public affairs office, which announced his arrest on March 1, 2019.

“Today, an Alameda County Superior Court Judge issued a warrant for the arrest of the suspect in the matter involving a February 19 assault on Sproul Plaza,” a statement from the university reads.

“Zachary Greenberg was arrested by the University of California Police Department (UCPD) on the warrant and booked into jail at 1 p.m. UCPD will formally present the case to the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office for consideration of the filing of criminal charges. Once the matter is presented and reviewed by the District Attorney’s Office, additional information will be made available regarding a charging decision.”

He was being held on $30,000 bail in the Alameda County Jail, online records show. According to Fox News, Greenberg was “charged with assault with a deadly weapon and attempting to cause great bodily injury.”

2. Greenberg Once Worked for the University

Although Greenberg is not currently affiliated with UC-Berkeley, that wasn’t always the case.

The university confirmed to Campus Reform that Zachary Greenberg was once an employee of the university. Specifically, the university told the site, he “was employed by UC-Berkeley from May 21-July 9, 2010 as a lab assistant in the Department of Psychology.”

Furthermore, he was “briefly a non-degree seeking student at UC-Berkeley,” Campus Reform reported. It’s not clear why he was on campus when the attack occurred.

3. The University Previously Revealed a Potential Suspect was Identified & Said He Wasn’t a Student

Caught on Camera: Conservative Assaulted on UC Berkeley CampusPolice are looking for a suspect who assaulted a man publicizing his conservative viewpoints on the campus of University of California, Berkeley in an attack captured on video. Andria Borba reports. (2-21-19) 2019-02-22T03:38:52.000Z

On February 22, 2019, the university announced that a potential suspect had already been identified.

“Responding quickly to information provided by members of the UC Berkeley campus community, the University of California Police Department (UCPD) has identified a potential suspect in the violent crime that occurred on February 19th, 2019 on the Sproul Plaza (UCPD case #19-00455). Based on current information available to the department, the suspect is not a student at, or affiliate of, the University,” the university wrote.

At that time, wrote the university, “This is still an active investigation and to support its efforts to apprehend the suspect, UCPD is encouraging anyone with information regarding this case to contact the UCPD Criminal Investigations Unit at: (510) 642-0472 during business hours, except holidays; and (510) 642-6760 at all other times.”

The University also confirmed, the statement said, that “the victim is not a student at, or affiliate of, the University, and had joined members of a student group as a member of an advocacy training program.”

“The fact that the victim was not a campus affiliate has no bearing on this case. He had every right to be on campus, and every right to express his point of view,” said campus spokesperson Dan Mogulof.

The university stressed: “UC Berkeley’s commitment to freedom of expression and perspective is unwavering, as is its intolerance for violence and harassment. Yesterday, Chancellor Carol Christ, in a message to the entire campus community, clearly communicated the University’s values and commitments.”

“Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason. That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here. Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering,” the chancellor said.

“UCPD and the campus administration wish to thank the many members of the campus community who came forward with useful information,” the statement concluded.

According to CBS San Francisco, Greenberg was identified as “one of two men” caught on video confronting Hayden Williams, who had set up a table as part of Turning Point USA.

The group presented signs making commentary on the Jussie Smollett case, with one reading, “Hate Crimes Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,” and another that read, “This is MAGA Country,” CBS San Francisco reported. Smollett is the actor now accused by Chicago P.D. of fabricating an attack against himself.

Greenberg landed “two punches on Williams,” the television station reported, including one “directly on his face.” According to Fox News, Williams is “a field representative for the conservative group The Leadership Institute.”

Some conservative activists were unhappy with how long it took to make an arrest. On February 26, 2019, Charlie Kirk, founder and president of Turning Point USA, wrote on Twitter, “This attacker has not yet been arrested or charged with a crime. A hate crime was committed on campus at UC Berkeley and the attacker walks free. If the attacker was wearing a MAGA hat there would have been a nationwide manhunt for him. Outrage!”

The president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., also weighed in, writing on February 21: “When a liberal like Jussie cries wolf and fakes an attack he receives unmatched coverage, sympathy & support creating a tsunami of attention. When a conservative student literally gets punched in the face and it’s caught on video it barely makes a ripple.”

Kirk released a statement to Fox News after Greenberg’s arrest was announced.

“Today, we have finally learned the identity of the attacker and that the violent man has been arrested,” he wrote. “While every America should be afforded their due process, we believe that the video evidence in this case is incontrovertible. We hope 28-year-old Zachary Greenberg is prosecuted to the full extent of the law for assault with a deadly weapon, which should be considered an act of hate.’

He concluded, “Hopefully, this dark chapter will act as a wake up call to those concerned about actual politically motivated hate crimes in America. Berkeley and all college campuses across American should be safe havens for free thought and opinions – especially for a targeted conservative minority.”"

The Blast reports that the 36-year-old actor was spotted out with his brother as they headed into a Chicago restaurant. Smollett was released on bail, but will be back in court on March 14.

According to The Blast, the restaurant is a short distance from Smollett’s apartment, but he’s staying in a hotel that’s even closer, presumably, so that he can limit the likelihood of being seen.

Jussie Smollett has maintained that he is innocent of the charges. According to a report from CNN, on the day that he was arrested, he went to the set of Empire to apologize for the negative press the story had garnered and to re-assert that his account of the alleged attack was truthful.

But Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who gave an impassioned speech during a press conference about the case, has subsequently said that there’s more evidence that has not been released. He made this declaration during an interview with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America. As The Blast notes, this is the same outlet to which Smollett gave his first and only interview about the incident. That interview happened before his arrest and before the men who allegedly helped Smollett were questioned by police.

“There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that does not support the version that he gave,” Johnson said.

Despite the charges, The Blast notes that Smollett still has the support of his family. His sister, actress Jurnee Smollett, has done so publicly, decrying his purported mistreatment by the media and describing him as a victim that has been criminalized.

Did the pressures and anxieties of modern fame played any role in Jussie Smollett's seemingly inexplicable behavior? https://t.co/ZKKsbTRQdV pic.twitter.com/0qkMXupAlz — Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2019

The arrest and ongoing case have already had a negative effect on Smollett’s professional life. His character on Empire, Jamal Lyon, has been written out of the last two episodes of the show’s season. A statement from the show’s executive producers has described the situation as “emotional.”

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” the statement read. “Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”"

Increasingly, those cameras are owned by Chicago businesses. More than 20 of the 50 cameras used to track Smollett and two men who police say staged an attack on the actor in late January were privately owned.

For years, the Chicago Police Department and the city's Office of Emergency Management & Communications have been quietly enlisting private building owners to build out an extensive video-surveillance network beyond the tens of thousands of cameras the city itself put up. The agreements give CPD real-time access to private cameras during emergencies upon request.

With worries about crime spreading throughout Chicago, local business owners have a clear incentive to help police improve surveillance. Yet the proliferation of cameras also could draw them into contentious debates over personal privacy. So far, security appears to be trumping privacy.

Bill Sako, vice president of security risk consulting in the Chicago office of engineering and consulting firm Telgian, says a typical high-rise now has 300 to 400 cameras, up from 30 or 40 a decade ago. That doesn't count cameras installed by retailers and other tenants.

Police have access to a vast network of cameras that has increased by 75 percent since 2012 to about 35,000. Most are owned by city agencies other than police, such as schools and the CTA. Police won't say how many are privately owned, but Jonathan Lewin, chief of CPD's technical services bureau, says it has ""definitely been increasing. People see the value of it.""

Agreements with private camera owners allow police to view videos but not to record or store them.

With the help of more sophisticated software, police are using video to solve crimes faster and cheaper at a time when mounting financial pressures make it harder to add police officers fast enough to bring down Chicago's violent crime rate, which is significantly and stubbornly higher than in other big cities."

Actor and Singer, Jussie Smollett, who has been making headlines for allegedly staging an attack actually talked about how he was about to bow to pressure, seven months ago.

In an interview in June 2018, Jussie dished out advice to young actors looking to storm the industry.

His words, “I wish I had something really deep to say but I’m in my 30s and I’m trying my best to learn that I can’t bend anymore. I’m about to break.”

‘I’m trying to be as honest as I can. I’m not really good at that. I’m trying to come up with a good answer but I’m not good at that.

‘I’m not good at it yet, and I know the way I stay mentally healthy is by admitting things. I admit that I’m jealous, I admit that I’m insecure and that I’m not good at certain things. I’m getting better at it.’

‘For me, it’s about finding the joy in what we do. I don’t believe in happiness because I feel like happiness is an emotion that can be taken away.

‘Joy is something that lives deep inside of you.

‘That’s why I find joy in my sadness, frustration, love, hate, excitement, whatever emotion I’m feeling at that moment — joy is always there.’

Empire star Jussie Smollett concocted a ruse of sickening proportions — but the fallout is just getting started.

Somehow, Smollett still claims he was accosted by Trump supporters who beat him up, doused him with bleach, and threw a noose around his neck. To make his story even more unbelievable, Smollett claimed it happened in the middle of the night when it was twenty degrees below zero.

Now, two Nigerian co-conspirators are apologizing through their attorney. The pair ended up getting arrested as suspects, and both admitted to police that they were paid by Smollett to stage this attack.

“They understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” remarked Gloria Schmidt, an attorney for the brothers.

The motive in the case seems to be money. Smollett apparently wanted to hike his profile to receive more money, while the Nigerian brothers agreed to participate for a mere $3,500.

Now, both brothers have given full confessions to the police, and both have stated that they were paid thousands of dollars to stage the attack. Both were spotted on multiple different cameras, including footage showing the brothers buying the gear needed for the fake attack and approaching Jussie on the street.

This story is extremely alarming, but thankfully the fallout has been tame. The fake hate crime could have sparked a wave of racial violence in the U.S. And it now appears that Smollet was willing to testify against the suspects in the case, until he realized that Chicago Police had apprehended his paid co-conspirators.

The takeaway is fairly sickening. In a desperate search for notoriety and money, Smollet was willing to incriminate entirely innocent people. And worsen an already stratified racial and political climate in the United States.

Separately, Chicago police have stated that Jussie will be held accountable for his actions, and the actor looks likely to receive a felony count of falsifying a police report. Less serious disorderly conduct charges are also possible.

The two Nigerian brothers were obviously central to the hoax, but won’t receive charges as they provided evidence against Jussie."

“Greenberg was identified as one of two men who confronted a conservative activist who had set up a table in Sproul Plaza,” CBS San Francisco reports. “Hayden Williams, a volunteer with conservative group Talking Points USA was displaying signs that read, ‘Hate Crimes Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims’ – a reference to the Jussie Smollett case – and another saying ‘This is MAGA Country.'”

In a statement, UC-Berkeley wrote:

Today, an Alameda County Superior Court Judge issued a warrant for the arrest of the suspect in the matter involving a February 19 assault on Sproul Plaza. Zachary Greenberg was arrested by the University of California Police Department (UCPD) on the warrant and booked into jail at 1 p.m. UCPD will formally present the case to the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office for consideration of the filing of criminal charges. Once the matter is presented and reviewed by the District Attorney’s Office, additional information will be made available regarding a charging decision.

Greenberg was reportedly arrested in Berkeley “on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm with force likely to produce great bodily injury.” He is being held at Glenn Dyer Jail in Oakland on $30,000 bond with his arraignment set for Monday.

Fox News noted that “a series of delays and cryptic messages from authorities” drew outrage from Charlie Kirk, the founder and executive director of Turning Point USA.

“This is really surprising,” Kirk told Fox News a week after the incident. “From what I understand there’s been no arrest. I don’t understand why there’s no public arrest file on this guy. If he had been wearing a Make America Great Again hat and had punched a liberal in the face there’d be nationwide outrage and a manhunt to find him. The whole thing is crazy.”

“This is astonishing — what extra work needs to be done?” Kirk said in a separate Fox News report. “The assault was clearly captured on video. If the attacker was wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat this case would be wrapped up by now, daily press conferences would be occurring, and arrests would have already happened.”

Kirk posted the video to his Twitter account where it gained significant traction.

The foot-long noose made from nylon was discovered Thursday hanging in the aft-body building of Boeing's North Charleston campus where the aircraft manufacturer makes its 787 Dreamliner jets.

There was no note or any other corresponding materials found with the knotted rope explaining why it was hung or who may have been its intended target.

In a letter to employees circulated on Thursday, Brad Zaback, vice president and general manager of Boeing's 787 program, said the company is investigating and will take 'appropriate and necessary action' against whoever is responsible.

'I am saddened and angered that a racially-charged symbol was discovered on site,' Zaback said in his statement, which was reported in the Post and Courier.

'Diversity and inclusion are core to Boeing's enduring values, and there is absolutely no place for racism and these cowardly acts in society and especially in our company. We will work through this, and I appreciate all of you looking out for each other.'

North Charleston is the city where a black man named Walter Scott was fatally shot in the back while running from a white former police officer named Michael Slager in April of 2015.

A hung jury prevented Slager from being convicted of murder under state law, but he eventually pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott's civil rights and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

The Boeing plant is only 12 miles away from Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston where white supremacist Dylann Roof shot and killed nine black worshipers in June of 2015.

Roof was sentenced to death in January of 2017 and remains on death row.

More recently, actor Jussie Smollett was arrested and charged for allegedly orchestrating a noose-involved fake hate crime against himself.

Chicago police said the 36-year-old Empire actor paid two Nigerian extras on the show to beat him up, put a noose around his neck, and douse him with bleach.

Police claimed the alleged scheme was designed to boost Smollett's celebrity profile and allow him to negotiate a higher salary."

The assault was committed against Turning Point USA activist Hayden Williams, who says he was training other members of the organization when he was confronted and assaulted.

The incident, which took place on Feb. 19, garnered widespread attention due to video showing Williams being pushed, cursed at, and eventually punched in the face by a man in a black t-shirt.

Williams said he started recording the incident when he realized he might be in some danger. He pointed to the campus's liberal culture as contributing to the attack.

""There is a certain culture that is especially hostile on Berkeley's campus, and across the country, to conservative students,"" Williams said on Fox News. ""They're willing to use violence if they think you're being too controversial.""

(AP) — In a story Feb. 26 about a Michigan transgender, gay rights activist charged with arson, The Associated Press reported erroneously that police said the man tried to fabricate a hate crime by setting his home on fire. The FBI initially investigated the arson as a possible hate crime but police have not provided a motive.

A corrected version of the story is below:

Gay rights activist accused of setting own home on fire

Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist set his own home on fire

JACKSON, Mich. (AP) — Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist charged with arson set his home on fire in an incident initially investigated by the FBI as a possible hate crime, but the man’s attorney is questioning the evidence.

Attorney Daniel Barnett said the evidence is circumstantial and doesn’t provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Nikki Joly set the August 2017 fire that killed five pets at his home in Jackson.

The 54-year-old Joly was charged last year with first-degree arson. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court, The Detroit News reported.

“We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,” Elmer Hitt, Jackson’s director of police and fire services, said Monday. “We investigated it over what probably was a year’s time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.”

MLive.com obtained the arson investigation report that says gas station surveillance video shows Joly buying gasoline the day of the fire and traces of gasoline were found on his clothes. Phone records and witness statements show Joly was home around the time the fire was set, the report said.

“The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being seen,” police detective Aaron Grove wrote in the report.

Hitt declined to provide a potential motive for the arson. Barnett said the lack of motive causes doubt in the prosecutor’s case.

“It doesn’t make sense,” Barnett said. “(Joly) was citizen of the year.”

A local newspaper selected Joly as Jackson’s citizen of the year in 2018. Joly helped open the city’s first gay community center, organized its first gay pride festival and helped pass a nondiscrimination ordinance.

Chicago police last week charged the black and gay “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting a racist and homophobic attack."

Police Seeks Felony Warrant Against Man Who Sucker Punched Conservative Activist at UC Berkeley

Campus police are seeking a felony warrant against a man who was caught on camera punching a conservative activist at the University of California, Berkeley, on Feb. 19.

The police have finished their investigation, said campus spokesperson Dan Mogulof in a Feb. 26 statement reported by campus student newspaper The Daily Californian that day.

“Based on the results of that investigation, the department is seeking a felony warrant from the Alameda County district attorney for the identified suspect,” Mogulof said.

The university announced on Feb. 22 that the police identified a potential suspect, “responding quickly to information provided by members of the UC Berkeley campus community.”

“Based on current information available to the department, the suspect is not a student at, or affiliate of, the University,” the university stated.

What Happened

The activist, Hayden Williams, was manning a table, recruiting for Turning Point USA (TPUSA), a conservative student organization operating on 1,400 campuses. The display had signs reading, “Hate crime hoaxes hurt real victims” and “This is MAGA Country”—a reference to the case of Jussie Smollett, a TV actor charged with staging a racially motivated attack on himself and framing supporters of President Donald Trump by claiming the attackers referenced Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again,” The Daily Wire reported.

At some point, Williams was approached by two men who verbally accosted him. He started to record the men with his phone. One of the men knocked the phone from his hand. Williams picked up the phone and continued recording. The man started to shove and drag him. “You want to hit me? I’m going to shoot your [expletive],” he said at one point. Finally, after hurling several more curses and insults, he punched Williams in the face and promptly left.

University Response

The University confirmed that Williams is not a student or affiliated with the University. He “had joined members of a student group as a member of an advocacy training program,” the university stated.

“The fact that the victim was not a campus affiliate has no bearing on this case. He had every right to be on campus, and every right to express his point of view,” said campus spokesperson Dan Mogulof.

Here is the altercation from my friends perspective. Conservative activists, take note. This is exactly the right thing to do, and I am so proud of him for recognizing the situation and not retaliating with violence. pic.twitter.com/QEuJWEQtz8 — Brad Devlin (@bradleydevlin) February 21, 2019

In response to the incident, the university expressed “unwavering” commitment to “freedom of expression and perspective.”

“Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason,” Chancellor Carol Christ said in a message to the campus community. “That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here.”

A video of the incident was posted on Twitter by Charlie Kirk, president of TPUSA, and garnered some 2 million views by March 1.

“Imagine if the attacker was wearing MAGA hat, would be national news!” Kirk said in the tweet. “This is the violent left!”

Williams is a field representative for the conservative Leadership Institute, a training organization for conservative activists."
