The 35-year-old is said to have arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday before heading to a Subway takeout restaurant for food around 2 a.m., TMZ was first to report.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed the report of an attack against the actor, releasing a statement to ET saying two unknown offenders allegedly gained Smollett’s attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him.

They also said the offenders reportedly began to batter the victim with their hands on his face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

At some point during the incident, one of the offenders allegedly wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene. The star then took himself to Northwestern Hospital.

CPD chief spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement obtained by ET: “Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show ‘Empire’.”

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators.”

TMZ also reported the two men had screamed, “This is MAGA country” during the attack. Rob Elgas of ABC 7 Chicago confirmed some of the reported details after speaking with a Chicago PD spokesperson, as published in a series of tweets on Monday.

Additionally, in their initial report, Jussie Smollett did not tell police his attackers yelled “MAGA.” Chicago Police PIO added: “I’m not saying it’s not true. He could have remembered later, but he did not tell officers that in the initial report.” 2/2 — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 29, 2019

CPD also says: when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 29, 2019

ThatGrapeJuice.Net published a threat letter by an unknown person, which had reportedly been sent to Fox Studios in Chicago eight days ago. It had cut-out letters spelling “You will die black f**k” on it.

Following news of the incident, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment (which produces “Empire”) issued a statement addressing the vicious attack.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our ‘Empire’ family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” reads the statement. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stand united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson has also released a statement: “The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling,” he states. “The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric. It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse. As this rhetoric continues to bleed into our everyday lives, dangerous behaviour will continue to place many law-abiding individuals at risk. We pray for a full physical and mental recovery Jussie Smollett and many unnamed victims of this form of hate based terrorism.”

In addition, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis issued a statement. “Our hearts are with Jussie Smollett as he recovers from a hate-motivated and repugnant attack in Chicago. Jussie has always used his voice and talent to create a better world, and it is disgusting that anyone, especially someone who has done such good for so many, would be targeted by undeniable hatred,” she said.

“GLAAD condemns these despicable acts as well as the racism and homophobia that drove them. Law enforcement needs to urgently conduct a thorough investigation and continue to be transparent with Chicago’s Black and LGBTQ communities who may be experiencing heightened fears of violence,” added Ellis.

“Jussie’s experience is sadly not unique in today’s America,” the statement concludes. “Countless LGBTQ and people of colour, as well as those who belong to both communities, are faced with hate-motivated violence on a near-daily basis. We stand with Black and racial justice leaders to combat hate violence in all of its forms.”

After the news emerged online, “Empire” director Eric Haywood posted:

I will burn your fucking house down to protect @JussieSmollett. Write that shit down. — Eric Haywood (@EricHaywood) January 29, 2019

GLAAD also released a statement to Deadline, which read: “GLAAD reached out to Fox and Jussie’s team today to offer assistance as well as support for him. Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels took to Instagram to send his support to Smollett via a heartfelt video.

“Empire” star Vivica A. Fox then posted:

Jussie Smollett’s attack is an example of how racism and homophobia both play a role in how black LGBT people are still oppressed in this country. That whole “you black before you gay” shit is bull because we have both experiences at the same time. — Izanagi. (@johnnyshady_) January 29, 2019

Jussie Smollett, one of the stars of the TV show Empire, reportedly was brutally attacked early Tuesday in what Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime. The 36-year-old actor took himself to the hospital directly after what police called a ""possible racially-charged assault and battery""; authorities say he is in good condition.

Police received a report that Smollett, who is black and gay, was walking in the downtown Chicago neighborhood of Streeterville around 2 a.m. local time ""when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" the city's police department told NPR. ""The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.""

The alleged assault did not end there.

""At some point during the incident,"" police added, ""one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

Authorities say the two attackers fled on foot. Chicago police say they are gathering video, identifying potential witnesses and trying to establish a timeline of events.

Police put out a call for anyone who had been in the area at the time to submit information to their tip line.

On Fox's Empire, Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, a young gay man trying to win his music mogul father's approval.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to NPR that it was ""deeply saddened and outraged"" at the news. ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

In Chicago, the actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted in the early hours of this morning. Chicago police have confirmed that they are treating the attack as a possible hate crime. Smollett is gay and multiracial. He stars in the hit Fox TV drama ""Empire."" It's about a family that owns a music company, and Smollett plays Jamal, a gay character struggling to win his father's approval. Here he is singing on the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""EMPIRE"")

JUSSIE SMOLLETT: (As Jamal Lyon, singing) So what? I'm gay. It don't matter. God ain't made you no better than me. When I pray...

SHAPIRO: For more on this attack, NPR's Colin Dwyer joins us now. Hi, Colin.

COLIN DWYER, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.

SHAPIRO: What can you tell us so far about this assault? And what do we know happened?

DWYER: So to start off, I must preface this with the fact that details remain a little bit sketchy at the moment, but we do know some facts from the Chicago Police Department. They say that he was walking down by the waterfront section of downtown Chicago when two individuals assailed him. They started hurling racial epithets at him, started hurling homophobic slurs at him as well. And they gained his attention through that, and they started beating him up.

And at this point, there are some actually disturbing details in the police report. They say that he had an unknown chemical substance poured on him during the course of this thing. And then before that attack was done, the two individuals apparently wrapped a rope around his neck, according to police. Those individuals actually fled on foot. And now the police are trying to find out who they are.

SHAPIRO: You mentioned homophobic and racial slurs. Police are investigating this as a hate crime. Tell us more about that.

DWYER: That's correct. So they obviously see this as a potential situation in which this was either racially motivated or motivated through homophobia or perhaps both it seems. So police are now calling out to the country as a whole asking for tips on who these two people might be. One bright side to this is that it does seem that Smollett is feeling OK. He's in good condition, according to the police. He actually brought himself over to the hospital shortly after this. And he seems to be in good condition.

SHAPIRO: He brought himself to the hospital. He was not taken there by ambulance or anything.

DWYER: That's correct.

SHAPIRO: He's a very popular figure in Hollywood. I've seen a huge response on social media today. Tell us more about what the reaction has been.

DWYER: That's right. So almost immediately the moment that this news broke, we saw an outpouring from his colleagues and co-workers and friends across the industry. That includes Kerry Washington, Viola Davis. The co-creator of the show, Danny Strong, actually came out with some really strong words. He said whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light onto the world for decades to come.

SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Colin Dwyer covering this assault on the actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. We're going to continue following this story as we get more details. Colin, thanks a lot.

ORIGINAL: Empire star Jussie Smollett was the victim of an assault in Chicago that appears to have been a hate crime. TMZ and TV Line reports that Smollett, who is gay and plays the (also gay) character of Jamal Lyons on the FOX series, was attacked in Chicago on late Monday by two men who beat him and put a noose around his head.

According to TMZ, Smollett had just arrived in Chicago from New York and went to a Subway to eat. As he was headed home, someone yelled at him “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n****r?” Then the two men, described as white and wearing ski masks, attacked him. Smollett fought back but was beat down, suffering a fractured rib. The men put a rope around his next, poured bleach on him and eventually fled, yelling, “This is MAGA country.” Smollett headed to Northwestern Memorial where he was treated and discharged late Tuesday morning.

According to celebrity news site That Grape Juice, there is evidence to suggest that this was a premeditated attack. A letter was set to Fox Studios in Chicago with cut-out letters that spelled out, “You will die black f**” and contain a crude drawing of a man being shot. TMZ says the letter was sent eight days ago. The envelope says “MAGA” in the upper left-hand corner.

The attack is being investigated by Chicago police as a possible hate crime. Smollett and the rest of the main cast will have armed security while they shoot the final handful of scenes for the current season in Chicago.

Fox issued a statement which read, “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”"

Ozzy Osbourne has postponed the entire European leg of his No More Tours 2 tour, just after calling off four dates.

After coming down with the flu, the Crazy Train singer has been diagnosed with a ‘severe upper-respiratory infection’.

In a post on his Instagram page, it was revealed doctors had warned the 70-year-old not to go on the road as his illness could ‘develop into pneumonia’.

‘I’m completely devastated for having to postpone the European leg of my tour,’ a statement from Sharon Osbourne’s husband read.

‘It just seems that since October everything I touch has turned to shit. First the staph infection in my thumb and now coming down with the flu and bronchitis.

‘I want to apologise to all of my fans who have been so loyal over the years, my band, my crew and to Judas Priest for letting you all down.

‘However, I promise the tour with Judas Priest will be completed,’ he added. ‘It’s being rescheduled right now to start in September. Again, I apologise to everyone. God Bless. Love you all, Ozzy.’

Understanding fans rushed to support the singer, urging him to feel better.

‘Ozzy man! You’ve gotta get better soon, we love you,’ a follower posted.

‘Get well soon Ozzy and don’t worry we can wait just want you better xx,’ one wrote.

With another fan simply adding: ‘Oh noooo!! Feel better soon Ozzy.’

Ozzy was set to kick off his No More Tours 2 run at Dublin’s 3Arena later this week, but previously pulled out over an illness.

Following the announcement, MCD promoters reassured fans they will not miss out on seeing the musician on stage.

Earlier this week, the rocker shared a grim update on his health, explaining he’d coughed so much that he’d burst a blood vessel in his eye.

And, if that wasn’t already way too much information, Oz posted a picture of said eye to go with it.

Let’s hope he gets better before gracing us all with another TMI picture…

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

In Chicago, the actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted in the early hours of this morning. Chicago police have confirmed that they are treating the attack as a possible hate crime. Smollett is gay and multiracial. He stars in the hit Fox TV drama ""Empire."" It's about a family that owns a music company, and Smollett plays Jamal, a gay character struggling to win his father's approval. Here he is singing on the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""EMPIRE"")

JUSSIE SMOLLETT: (As Jamal Lyon, singing) So what? I'm gay. It don't matter. God ain't made you no better than me. When I pray...

SHAPIRO: For more on this attack, NPR's Colin Dwyer joins us now. Hi, Colin.

COLIN DWYER, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.

SHAPIRO: What can you tell us so far about this assault? And what do we know happened?

DWYER: So to start off, I must preface this with the fact that details remain a little bit sketchy at the moment, but we do know some facts from the Chicago Police Department. They say that he was walking down by the waterfront section of downtown Chicago when two individuals assailed him. They started hurling racial epithets at him, started hurling homophobic slurs at him as well. And they gained his attention through that, and they started beating him up.

And at this point, there are some actually disturbing details in the police report. They say that he had an unknown chemical substance poured on him during the course of this thing. And then before that attack was done, the two individuals apparently wrapped a rope around his neck, according to police. Those individuals actually fled on foot. And now the police are trying to find out who they are.

SHAPIRO: You mentioned homophobic and racial slurs. Police are investigating this as a hate crime. Tell us more about that.

DWYER: That's correct. So they obviously see this as a potential situation in which this was either racially motivated or motivated through homophobia or perhaps both it seems. So police are now calling out to the country as a whole asking for tips on who these two people might be. One bright side to this is that it does seem that Smollett is feeling OK. He's in good condition, according to the police. He actually brought himself over to the hospital shortly after this. And he seems to be in good condition.

SHAPIRO: He brought himself to the hospital. He was not taken there by ambulance or anything.

DWYER: That's correct.

SHAPIRO: He's a very popular figure in Hollywood. I've seen a huge response on social media today. Tell us more about what the reaction has been.

DWYER: That's right. So almost immediately the moment that this news broke, we saw an outpouring from his colleagues and co-workers and friends across the industry. That includes Kerry Washington, Viola Davis. The co-creator of the show, Danny Strong, actually came out with some really strong words. He said whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light onto the world for decades to come.

SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Colin Dwyer covering this assault on the actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. We're going to continue following this story as we get more details. Colin, thanks a lot.

DWYER: Thank you so much, Ari.

Television Nicole Maines Dreamer Nicole Maines's Nia Nall accepted her powers (and her costume) in this week's episode of Supergirl.

Social media is blowing up over the news that Diego Luna plays a trans woman in the upcoming movie Berlin, I Love You, reigniting the debate over whether cisgender actors should be cast in trans roles.

Fortunately, this week’s Supergirl just offered a fine example of what happens when trans actors are cast as trans characters – or specifically, when Nicole Maines is allowed to use her own life experience to play television’s first trans superhero.

Maines is playing Nia Nal, who was introduced at the start of this season as a fledgling journalist Melissa Benoist’s Kara Danvers (aka Supergirl) takes under her wing. As the story unfolded, we learned more about Nia: she’s trans, she’s half-alien, her dreams sometimes predict future events.

Comic book fans quickly sussed out that Nia is the ancestor of 30th century superhero Nura Nal (aka Dream Girl) a founding member of the Legion Of Super Heroes, which has figured in previous seasons of the show. But a trans character is something new, and – as this week’s episode demonstrated – something that adds a whole new level of texture and drama to the storytelling.

The episode found Kara accompanying Nia on a trip home to Parthas, a bucolic little town where aliens and humans have lived in harmony for decades, and where Nia was raised with the knowledge that her family’s prophetic powers were passed exclusively from mothers to daughters, and only once in a generation. Because she is trans, Nia assumed she could never manifest these abilities – and under the same assumption, her sister Maeve (Hanna James) has prepared to receive them for her entire life. Nia and Maeve are both mistaken, and the revelation of Nia being the one to inherit the powers – and the super-suit that comes with them – shatters their supportive sibling dynamic, with Maeve angrily blurting out that Nia’s “not even a real woman.""

The powers are a fantastical construct, but that moment feels painfully real, as does the sense of betrayal that Nia carries with her back to National City at the close of the episode, which prompts Kara to reveal her own super-identity to her to show Nia she’s not alone. It’s a moment of support that reaches beyond the episode’s storyline, and – as acted by both Benoist and Maines – a scene of genuine connection between two people.

I’ve written previously about Supergirl’s openly political storytelling, with a season-long arc about a nativist villain spreading anti-alien sentiment across America serving as a barely-disguised allegory for the MAGA movement that’s exposed the country’s underbelly of racism and intolerance. (The news that the Black, openly gay actor Jussie Smollett had been assaulted and hospitalized in Chicago on Monday in an apparent hate crime just makes it feel even more of the moment.)

Maines’s casting and Nia’s storyline now feel like another statement of purpose, but one that’s more sensitive to the realities of trans people than one might expect from a superhero show that deals in broad strokes. Of course, the show’s got a track record of working with its cast to shape the characters’ storylines; last season featured an episode about James Olsen’s first encounter with racism drawn from actor Mehcad Brooks’s own experiences.

Maines told TV Line earlier this week she hopes the show will incorporate transphobia into the issues Supergirl overtly tackles, and I hope they do – but having Nia right there every week, and being portrayed as thoughtfully as she has been so far, is an excellent start.

Jussie Smollett, one of the stars of the TV show Empire, reportedly was brutally attacked early Tuesday in what Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime. The 36-year-old actor took himself to the hospital directly after what police called a ""possible racially-charged assault and battery""; authorities say he is in good condition.

Police received a report that Smollett, who is black and gay, was walking in the downtown Chicago neighborhood of Streeterville around 2 a.m. local time ""when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" the city's police department told NPR. ""The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.""

The alleged assault did not end there.

""At some point during the incident,"" police added, ""one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

Authorities say the two attackers fled on foot. Chicago police say they are gathering video, identifying potential witnesses and trying to establish a timeline of events.

Police put out a call for anyone who had been in the area at the time to submit information to their tip line.

Smollett's mother is African-American and his father is Jewish. In a 2016 interview, he calls his family ""blu-ish — black and Jewish.""

On Fox's Empire, Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, a young gay man trying to win his music mogul father's approval.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to NPR that it was ""deeply saddened and outraged"" at the news. ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.""

In an emotional video, Empire co-creator Lee Daniels addressed Smollett, whom he calls ""my son.""

""You didn't deserve, nor anyone deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,"" he says. ""You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. ... Hold your head up, Jussie. I'm with you, I'll be there in a minute. It's just another f****** day in America.""

In a statement to NPR, GLAAD Communications Director Mathew Lasky said Smollett is ""a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.""

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

In Chicago, the actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted in the early hours of this morning. Chicago police have confirmed that they are treating the attack as a possible hate crime. Smollett is gay and multiracial. He stars in the hit Fox TV drama ""Empire."" It's about a family that owns a music company, and Smollett plays Jamal, a gay character struggling to win his father's approval. Here he is singing on the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""EMPIRE"")

JUSSIE SMOLLETT: (As Jamal Lyon, singing) So what? I'm gay. It don't matter. God ain't made you no better than me. When I pray...

SHAPIRO: For more on this attack, NPR's Colin Dwyer joins us now. Hi, Colin.

COLIN DWYER, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.

SHAPIRO: What can you tell us so far about this assault? And what do we know happened?

DWYER: So to start off, I must preface this with the fact that details remain a little bit sketchy at the moment, but we do know some facts from the Chicago Police Department. They say that he was walking down by the waterfront section of downtown Chicago when two individuals assailed him. They started hurling racial epithets at him, started hurling homophobic slurs at him as well. And they gained his attention through that, and they started beating him up.

And at this point, there are some actually disturbing details in the police report. They say that he had an unknown chemical substance poured on him during the course of this thing. And then before that attack was done, the two individuals apparently wrapped a rope around his neck, according to police. Those individuals actually fled on foot. And now the police are trying to find out who they are.

SHAPIRO: You mentioned homophobic and racial slurs. Police are investigating this as a hate crime. Tell us more about that.

DWYER: That's correct. So they obviously see this as a potential situation in which this was either racially motivated or motivated through homophobia or perhaps both it seems. So police are now calling out to the country as a whole asking for tips on who these two people might be. One bright side to this is that it does seem that Smollett is feeling OK. He's in good condition, according to the police. He actually brought himself over to the hospital shortly after this. And he seems to be in good condition.

SHAPIRO: He brought himself to the hospital. He was not taken there by ambulance or anything.

DWYER: That's correct.

SHAPIRO: He's a very popular figure in Hollywood. I've seen a huge response on social media today. Tell us more about what the reaction has been.

DWYER: That's right. So almost immediately the moment that this news broke, we saw an outpouring from his colleagues and co-workers and friends across the industry. That includes Kerry Washington, Viola Davis. The co-creator of the show, Danny Strong, actually came out with some really strong words. He said whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light onto the world for decades to come.

SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Colin Dwyer covering this assault on the actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. We're going to continue following this story as we get more details. Colin, thanks a lot.

DWYER: Thank you so much, Ari.

But when detectives followed up with Jussie Smollett later on Tuesday, he recalled the offenders making those comments, and the detectives completed a supplemental report.

Rob Elgas of WLS-TV in Chicago tweeted that after investigators heard the ""MAGA country"" claim in the news they called Smollett again, after which he added that information.

Original story below



Numerous media outlets on Tuesday reported that ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago by men who yelled, ""This is MAGA country!"" — a reference to the iconic red ""Make America Great Again"" hat from President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.

But Chicago Police on Tuesday afternoon told TheBlaze they have no information regarding the alleged attackers' descriptions nor on what they said. Officer Michelle Tannehill added to TheBlaze that detectives are still investigating, gathering video, and speaking to witnesses.

Police released a statement saying they ""received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire. Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Smollett was walking on Tuesday when two unknown offenders approached him and started yelling ""racial and homophobic slurs,"" USA Today reported, citing police. The pair used their hands to batter the victim and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, the paper added, noting one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck. Smollett then transported himself to Northwestern Hospital, USA Today added, citing police, adding that the actor is in good condition.

Media outlets pounce

But TMZ ran with a story Tuesday that said a whole lot more:

Sources directly connected to Jussie tell TMZ, the actor arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday, and at around 2 AM he was hungry and went to a Subway. We're told when shortly after he walked out on his way home, someone yelled, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?""



The 2 men — both white and wearing ski masks — viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, ""This is MAGA country.""

Numerous outlets picked up TMZ's additional details:

Vanity Fair cited TMZ's report, noting that ""sources directly linked to Smollett say the actor was exiting a Subway sandwich shop at 2 A.M. when two white men accosted him, using anti-gay and racist slurs before putting his head in a noose, pouring bleach on him, and reportedly screaming, 'This is MAGA country.'""

Slate also cited TMZ's report, saying ""the attackers used homophobic and racial slurs as they attacked Smollett, and yelled 'This is MAGA country!'""

People said ""TMZ reports that his attackers allegedly yelled, 'This is MAGA country.' PEOPLE has not been able to independently confirm this.""

The Root's Grapevine noted TMZ's report, saying ""two white men in ski masks reportedly approached the 35-year-old actor ... yelled out racial and homophobic slurs (""Aren't you that f***ot Empire n*****?""), then began to attack him with an unknown chemical substance"" and that ""one of the men wrapped a rope around Smollett's neck, as if forming a noose. They then yelled, 'This is MAGA country!'""

LogoTV tweeted that Smollett ""was attacked by two masked men who put his neck in a noose, yelled racial & homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him, and yelled ""This is #MAGA country!""

You get the idea.

TheBlaze on Tuesday didn't immediately hear back from Chicago Police regarding who reported the incident as possibly racist in nature.

USA Today offered the following background on Smollett:

Smollett, who plays gay character Jamal Lyon on ""Empire,"" joined the hit Fox show in 2015. He also starred in the 2017 film ""Marshall.""



During an appearance on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" in March 2015, Smollett came out as gay himself. He expanded upon his sexuality in an interview with Out Magazine in 2016.



""I am a gay man with an extremely open heart ... If I had to label myself, I would label myself as a gay man,"" he told the magazine at the time. ""If I fall in love down the road with a woman, I'm going to love that woman.""

Messages of support for Smollett hit social media after news of the attack.

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I'm praying for his quick recovery.



This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.

— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

No matter what's happening around us, @JussieSmollett is ALWAYS quick w/ a massive smile & hug. Thats the kind of man he is. The homophobic, racist hate crime against him & hate crimes against countless others cannot stand. Rebuke hatred any & every time it rears its ugly head.

Led by The_Donald, the Trump-supporting spot on Reddit, many began to make baseless claims that the actor was lying about the attack and its motives. Initial reports from TMZ claimed that the attack was carried out by apparent Trump supporters who warned the actor that he was in “MAGA country.” When the Chicago Police Department clarified that they had no report of the attackers making reference to Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, right-wing corners of the internet circulated claims that the entire attack was fabricated.

A series of posts showed up on The_Donald questioning the attack, with many claiming it was some kind of hoax or fabrication.

“Because there are so many white supremacists at 2AM, on a subway, in Chicago, carrying a noose and bleach and they recognize him from a tv show that’s 90% black actors and best of all ZERO PROOF!…” one of the top comments read. “WTF kind of racist fantasy land does this idiot live in??? 100% hate crime hoax.”

“He got mugged and is trying to turn himself into a race martyr,” another claimed.

Others picked up the call on Twitter, saying they were suspicious of the details of the attack on Jussie Smollett and others outright accusing the actor of lying about the attack that left him bruised and bloodied.

Folks, be careful about this story that TV personality Jussie Smollett was hurt in a homophobic attack in Chicago. This whole story sounds EXACTLY like the sort of stories that are later identified as a hoax. — Warner Todd Huston (@warnerthuston) January 29, 2019

This is not the first time that The_Donald has claimed that allegations of a far-right attack are fake. Last year, the site and other right-wing media figures said that the series of bombs mailed to opponents of Donald Trump had all the markings of a hoax. As Vanity Fair noted, this included some more mainstream figures like Candace Owens who said there was a “zero percent chance” that conservatives sent the mail bombs and Rush Limbaugh who labeled it a false flag meant to help Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections.

The man later arrested by federal investigators for the bombings was an ardent supporter of Donald Trump who was identified driving a white van completely covered in stickers praising the president.

In Chicago, police have not announced a suspect in the attack on Jussie Smollett and have not divulged a possible motive for the beating."

Viola Davis tweeted, ""THIS is why the LGBTQ community continue to fight to be seen and PROTECTED against hate!""

Zendaya commented, ""I just hope there is justice in this hateful and targeted act of violence.""

One of the most emotional responses to the incident came from Empire co-creator Lee Daniels, who said in a video, ""It's taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie, you are my son. You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called, 'die f-----, n-----, ' or whatever they said to you. You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other, regardless of what sexual orientation we are.

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him.""

Stars like John Legend, Danielle Brooks and Kerry Washington were among the public voices speaking out about the attack and the motives behind it, as were a number of journalists and activists.

The two senators, Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., last year introduced an anti-lynching bill that would make attacks like the one on Smollett a federal crime.

“This was an attempted modern-day lynching,” tweeted Harris, who last week announced her 2020 presidential bid. “No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

Booker, D-N.J., shared a similar post on his Twitter account.

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe,” Booker wrote. “To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime — I urge you to pay attention.”

The Justice for Victims of Lynching Act was introduced in June by Harris, Booker and Tim Scott, R-S.C. — the Senate’s three black members — and it applies to lynchings motivated by a victim’s “actual or perceived religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.”

The bill passed unanimously in the Senate last month and has not yet been voted on in the House. The bill notes that at least 4,742 people, mainly African-Americans, were reportedly lynched in the U.S. from 1882 to 1968.

In a statement released shortly after its Senate passage on Dec. 19, Booker called it “an emotional and historic day.”

“For over a century, members of Congress have attempted to pass some version of a bill that would recognize lynching for what it is: a bias-motivated act of terror. And for more than a century, and more than 200 attempts, this body has failed,” Booker stated. “We have righted that wrong and taken corrective action that recognizes this stain on our country’s history.”

The Justice for Victims of Lynching Act made news earlier this month when Liberty Counsel, an evangelical nonprofit that opposes gay rights, took issue with the bill’s inclusion of LGBTQ people.

""The old saying is once that camel gets the nose in the tent, you can't stop them from coming the rest of the way in,"" the organization's chairman, Mat Staver, said in an interview with conservative Christian news outlet OneNewsNow. “This is a way to slip it in under a so-called anti-lynching bill, and to then to sort of circle the wagon and then go for the juggler [sic] at some time in the future.""

Staver told OneNewsNow that his organization, which has been labeled an anti-LGBTQ “hate group” by the Southern Poverty Law Center, is lobbying lawmakers in the House to have them remove the bill’s “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” language before taking a vote.

The “Empire” star was beaten by two men who yelled out racial and homophobic slurs. They put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him. As they left, they reportedly yelled, “This is MAGA country.” Smollett was hospitalized and remains in “good condition,” according to police.

Following the brutal attack, celebrities took to social media to voice their support for the 35-year-old actor and demand justice.

John Legend was among the first to speak out against the “horrific” crime. “Sending love to Jussie and the Smollett family after this horrific attack,” he tweeted. “We support you and pray that you find peace and justice.”

A heartbroken Kehlani was left “speechless,” while 50 Cent sent his prayers and called for Jussie’s attackers to be “quickly brought to justice.”

T.I. also demanded recourse and called for an uprising. “It’s a Disgusting Fuckking shame we continue to allow this shit to happen to OUR PEOPLE with no recourse!!!!” he said. “THE HITS WONT STOP UNTIL WE HIT BACK!!!! Revolution is imminent… Laws of reciprocity say so… Prayers are great… But when I’m wronged… get up off your knees and RIDE for ME!!!!! Be strong & Stay solid We here for you Bro.”

Janelle Monáe penned a heartfelt note to her friend and fellow member of the LGBTQ community. “THIS HATE CRIME against our brother @jussiesmollett is proof that no matter how famous you may be it still does not protect you from vicious racist homophobes !!” she wrote. “AND It is still a risk daily to be a BLACK , OUT , and PROUD human being . I am sending so much love to you Jussie . Praying for your healing . Thank you for being such an inspiration to me & soooooo mannnnny people.”

Others including Ariana Grande, Janet Jackson, Halle Berry, and Zendaya also expressed their disgust and offered their prayers.

Jussie’s “Empire” family, including the show’s co-creators Danny Strong and Lee Daniels, took to social media to express their sadness and outrage. “You didn’t deserve to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die f****t, n****r,’ or whatever they said to you,” said Daniels in an Instagram video. “You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united.”

NAACP President and CEO, Derrick Johnson, has also issued a statement following Smollett’s assault. “The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling,” he said. “The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric. It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse.”

Smollett is in hospital in a good condition, according to reports He appears in Empire, a musical drama about the hip-hop industry

The 36-year-old African-American television actor, who is gay, was reported to be in good condition after taking himself to a hospital after the incident early on Tuesday, local time, police said.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Chicago police said in a statement.

The two unknown assailants approached Smollett on a downtown Chicago street at about 2:00am local time on Tuesday and began a ""possible racially charged"" attack, yelling racial and homophobic slurs, police said.

The assailants hit him in the face, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives are gathering video footage from the area and looking for witnesses.

According to CNN, Smollett said he fought back against his attackers.

Police did not identify Smollett by name, but gave his age and said he had a role on Empire. Representatives from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment confirmed he was the victim.

""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,"" Fox officials said in an emailed statement.

A representative for Smollett did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Empire, a musical drama about the hip-hop and entertainment industry, has been nominated for Grammy and Golden Globe awards.

Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

CNN reported that Smollett took himself to Chicago's Northwestern Hospital, and ""is in good condition"", according to police.

Shocked peers react to attack

Smollett's peers and colleagues said they were shocked by the attack.

""The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,"" Empire co-creator Danny Strong said on Twitter.

Raquel Willis, an African-American transgender rights activist and executive editor of Out magazine, a lifestyle publication that centres on the LGBT community, condemned the attack on Twitter.

""The hate that fuels white supremacy is the same hate that fuels homophobia,"" Willis said.

""A conscientious society realises it's at war with both.""

Empire actor Jussie Smollett was hospitalized after allegedly being assaulted in Chicago by two individuals who also tied a noose around his neck, and who poured an unknown chemical substance on him. The unidentified culprits appear to be Trump supporters who, according to TMZ, yelled at Smollett, “This is MAGA country,” along with hurling racist and homophobic slurs.

A Chicago Police spokesperson told The Daily Beast that the attackers' genders were unknown (TMZ reported it was two men), and that their faces and hands had been covered. The police spokesperson said it was unknown if, as TMZ reported, they had been wearing ski masks. “There is no report of that being said,” the spokesperson said of the allegedly shouted, “This is MAGA country.”

Later, it was revealed that in a supplemental interview Smollett had told cops that his attackers had shouted, “MAGA country.”

The Daily Beast has reached out to Smollett for comment via his representatives.

Regardless of the details surrounding whether or not these attackers are Donald Trump supporters are not, we do know that six days prior to Smollett’s assault the Empire actor—whose character is one of the most impressively-written black LGBT characters on television—received hate mail sent to Fox Studios in Chicago that threatened, “You will die black f**.”

It shouldn’t be a coincidence that such bigotry escalated from written hate mail to physical violence. History often showed us during the Jim Crow era of the 20th century that discriminatory laws led to lynchings and other legalized acts of white supremacy. What happened to Smollett was a form of white terrorism that targeted both his racial identity and sexual orientation simultaneously.

People on social media have also been trying to encourage others to stop trying to defining this matter as solely being racist and/or homophobic, but to consider the intersections of both:

But despite these recent calls for intersectionality, America strives to enforce these binaries that are proving to be more toxic than helpful.

As of the publishing of this op-ed, television celebrity Ellen DeGeneres has still remained silent on Smollett’s attack.

It should be noted that the Empire star made his first-ever public coming out announcement while on her hit show in 2015.

DeGeneres, a white lesbian, has come under fire this month for defending comedian Kevin Hart for making homophobic jokes that cost him his Oscar hosting gig. “You have grown, you have apologized, you are apologizing again right now,” DeGeneres told Hart on her segment. “You've done it. Don't let those people win. Host the Oscars.”

But the problem with DeGeneres weighing in was that she ignored who was directly affected by Hart’s homophobic rhetoric: black gay men. In a 2011 tweet, Hart suggested he would tell his son, “stop that’s gay,” if he caught him playing with a dollhouse and would respond by breaking the toy over the child’s head. The target of Hart’s punchline was black gay youth—not a white older lesbian—which made it all the more painful for her to extend him grace.

We have seen similar instances of intersectional matters being whitewashed, such as when prominent news outlets ignored the fact that a sweeping majority of the Orlando Pulse nightclub victims were Latinx queer people. Or when it wasn’t emphasized by some that the victims found dead in Democratic donor Ed Buck’s residence were black gay men.

These forms of visible erasure do more to ignore how intense the oppression is if you are both of color and LGBTQ.

As a black gay man, I often face marginalization in ways that are both unexpected and cruel. I’ve experienced racial discrimination within my own local LGBTQ community in Philadelphia in gay bars and nightclubs. But I’ve also dealt with the homophobia with my own black community, and such instances deeply impacted how I chose to live my truth for quite some time.

To try to put me in a binary as being either black or gay is a disgusting way of viewing diversity and understanding the lived experiences of those who live within the fringes of society.

“ Why isn’t there more support for murdered Black trans women within the Black community as for slain cisgender Black men? Why aren’t there more efforts to eradicate the HIV/AIDS crisis still impacting Black gay men as there were for white gay men decades ago? ”

It’s important to acknowledge that the hate Smollett faced as a black gay man was a bi-product of society’s tolerance of racism and homophobia. There is racial bias in how LGBTQ people are protected in mainstream society, as there is homophobia in how black people are protected within their own community.

Why isn’t there more support for murdered black trans women within the Black community as for slain cisgender black men? Why aren’t there more efforts to eradicate the HIV/AIDS crisis still impacting black gay men as there were for white gay men decades ago? These are the questions I ask myself daily when people try to suggest that I choose between an LGBTQ community or a black one.

If we are to truly be a society that is serious about combating white supremacy, we have to recognize that racism and homophobia are byproducts that prolong such hate.

A black homophobe who chooses to isolate black LGBTQ people within the community is furthering the same tactics used by white supremacists to persecute us all. White LGBTQ people who continue to ignore the struggles of LGBTQ people of color are practicing the same level of racism that does more to divide than unite. It’s high time we call these forms of anti-blackness out within our own spaces as we try to combat more high-profile instances.

Moving forward, do not treat what happened to Smollett as an isolated incident but something that’s a glaring consequence of society’s entrenched struggle with race and sexuality. If bigots can’t seem to separate their victims’ dual identities, neither should we. Spend less time forcing black gay men like me to choose one, and strive to protect and defend both.

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him.""

Stars like John Legend, Danielle Brooks and Kerry Washington were among the public voices speaking out about the attack and the motives behind it, as were a number of journalists and activists.

UPDATE (3/26/19), 11:35 AM EST: The charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett — over allegedly staging a racial attack against himself in Chicago on January 29 — have all been dropped, his Chicago-based attorney Ronald Safer confirms to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued the following statement (on March 26, 2019 at 1:15 PM EST) in wake of this development: “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”

ORIGINAL: Jussie Smollett, 35, was hospitalized at Northwestern Hospital after a horrifying attack on Jan. 29 that Chicago authorities are investigating as a possible hate crime. “Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department told HollywoodLife in a statement. The public has been given its first look at the resulting injuries, as a photo of Jussie in his hospital bed was screengrabbed in a FaceTime call between the Empire actor and the show’s co-creator, Lee Daniels. Jussie’s face appears swollen and now bears a cut under his right eye, as seen in the second photo of the slideshow below. Not pictured is the fractured rib he also sustained, according to TMZ.

Leading up to the injuries, Jussie was walking outside a Subway shop on early Monday morning, as he had just returned on a delayed flight from New York. That’s when “two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department said in its statement. They began to “batter” Jussie’s face, “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him, “wrapped a rope” around his neck and then fled. Empire’s co-creator claimed that the “chemical substance” was bleach. Jussie took himself to the hospital afterwards, and authorities reported he’s in “good condition,” despite the photo below.

TMZ added more details to the cops’ report. According to the outlet’s sources “directly connected to Jussie,” the two assailants were reportedly white and wearing ski masks and specifically called out, “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****?” During the attack, they also allegedly yelled, “This is MAGA country.” The sources added that eight days prior to the attack, Chicago’s Fox Studios (which airs Empire) received a ransom letter that read, “You will die black f**,” with Jussie’s full name on the envelope — ThatGrapeJuice.Net obtained the pictures. Jussie is celebrated as a champion in the LGBTQ community, as he came out on Ellen Degeneres’ show in 2015.

Empire’s co-creator also took to his Instagram to share an emotional message after the brutal attack. “It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie, you are my son,” Lee began in the video above. “You didn’t deserve — nor does anybody deserve — to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called, ‘Die, f***** n*****’ or whatever they said to you.” You can listen to his full message above.

Like Lee, many celebrities, co-stars and even politicians took to their social media accounts to voice their outrage and heartbreak. From actress Kerry Washington to Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, many reacted to this ugly act of cruelty — you can read their responses, here."

The Fox show’s production schedule remains “fluid” for the rest of the week, according to the source. It is not yet known how Smollett’s injuries will ultimately impact production on the current season, which would typically wrap in March.

A representative for Fox declined to comment on production of “Empire.”

The attack on the actor, which is being characterized as a possible hate crime, involved two men yelling out “racial and homophobic slurs” at Smollett, pouring an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapping a rope around his neck, according to the Chicago Police Department.

According to ABC News, an earlier threat had been made in letter form to Smollett prior to Tuesday, and the investigation has now been handed over to the FBI.

“Empire” executive producer Brian Grazer said he was “disgusted and saddened by the attack on Jussie.”

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our ‘Empire’ family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement."

Jussie Smollett

Empire star Jussie Smollett has been hospitalized in Chicago, Illinois after he was targetted in a brutal homophobic beating.

Reports suggest the actor had just left his Chicago apartment to get something to eat in the early hours of Tuesday when two white men approached him and allegedly began hurling racist and homophobic slurs at the star.

According to TMZ sources, the men recognized Smollett from his role as openly gay singer/songwriter Jamal Lyon on hit hip-hop drama Empire, and shouted, ""Aren't you that f***ot Empire n***er?""

Police claim the suspects, who were wearing black ski masks, began beating him up and poured an unknown chemical substance over him, before using a rope as a noose around the 35 year old's neck.

TMZ insiders allege the men yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" as they ran off, referencing U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again,"" which has been adopted by white supremacists to promote their beliefs.

A friend of Smollett's found the star and reported the attack to authorities, while the actor checked himself into Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was treated for his injuries, including a fractured rib, reports The Blast.

Smollett has since been discharged and was listed in a ""good condition.""

Cops are investigating the assault, but have yet to identify the suspects or make any arrests in the case.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" reads a police statement issued to The Hollywood Reporter.

Meanwhile, it's been revealed that officers had already been looking into a disturbing death threat sent to Smollett, who is gay in real life, at the Fox Studios in Chicago.

The envelope, on which the sender was simply listed as ""MAGA,"" contained a letter with magazine letters cut out to spell, ""You will die black f**."" Sources tell TMZ it was sent eight days before Smollett's attack."

Jussie Smollett, one of the stars of the TV show Empire, reportedly was brutally attacked early Tuesday in what Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime. The 36-year-old actor took himself to the hospital directly after what police called a ""possible racially-charged assault and battery""; authorities say he is in good condition.

Police received a report that Smollett, who is black and gay, was walking in the downtown Chicago neighborhood of Streeterville around 2 a.m. local time ""when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" the city's police department told NPR. ""The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.""

The alleged assault did not end there.

""At some point during the incident,"" police added, ""one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

Authorities say the two attackers fled on foot. Chicago police say they are gathering video, identifying potential witnesses and trying to establish a timeline of events.

Police put out a call for anyone who had been in the area at the time to submit information to their tip line.

Smollett's mother is African-American and his father is Jewish. In a 2016 interview, he calls his family ""blu-ish — black and Jewish.""

On Fox's Empire, Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, a young gay man trying to win his music mogul father's approval.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to NPR that it was ""deeply saddened and outraged"" at the news. ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.""

In an emotional video, Empire co-creator Lee Daniels addressed Smollett, whom he calls ""my son.""

""You didn't deserve, nor anyone deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,"" he says. ""You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. ... Hold your head up, Jussie. I'm with you, I'll be there in a minute. It's just another f****** day in America.""

...whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come. — Danny Strong (@Dannystrong) January 29, 2019

Co-creator Danny Strong called Smollett ""a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart.""

In a statement to NPR, GLAAD Communications Director Mathew Lasky said Smollett is ""a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.""

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

In Chicago, the actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted in the early hours of this morning. Chicago police have confirmed that they are treating the attack as a possible hate crime. Smollett is gay and multiracial. He stars in the hit Fox TV drama ""Empire."" It's about a family that owns a music company, and Smollett plays Jamal, a gay character struggling to win his father's approval. Here he is singing on the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""EMPIRE"")

JUSSIE SMOLLETT: (As Jamal Lyon, singing) So what? I'm gay. It don't matter. God ain't made you no better than me. When I pray...

SHAPIRO: For more on this attack, NPR's Colin Dwyer joins us now. Hi, Colin.

COLIN DWYER, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.

SHAPIRO: What can you tell us so far about this assault? And what do we know happened?

DWYER: So to start off, I must preface this with the fact that details remain a little bit sketchy at the moment, but we do know some facts from the Chicago Police Department. They say that he was walking down by the waterfront section of downtown Chicago when two individuals assailed him. They started hurling racial epithets at him, started hurling homophobic slurs at him as well. And they gained his attention through that, and they started beating him up.

And at this point, there are some actually disturbing details in the police report. They say that he had an unknown chemical substance poured on him during the course of this thing. And then before that attack was done, the two individuals apparently wrapped a rope around his neck, according to police. Those individuals actually fled on foot. And now the police are trying to find out who they are.

SHAPIRO: You mentioned homophobic and racial slurs. Police are investigating this as a hate crime. Tell us more about that.

DWYER: That's correct. So they obviously see this as a potential situation in which this was either racially motivated or motivated through homophobia or perhaps both it seems. So police are now calling out to the country as a whole asking for tips on who these two people might be. One bright side to this is that it does seem that Smollett is feeling OK. He's in good condition, according to the police. He actually brought himself over to the hospital shortly after this. And he seems to be in good condition.

SHAPIRO: He brought himself to the hospital. He was not taken there by ambulance or anything.

DWYER: That's correct.

SHAPIRO: He's a very popular figure in Hollywood. I've seen a huge response on social media today. Tell us more about what the reaction has been.

DWYER: That's right. So almost immediately the moment that this news broke, we saw an outpouring from his colleagues and co-workers and friends across the industry. That includes Kerry Washington, Viola Davis. The co-creator of the show, Danny Strong, actually came out with some really strong words. He said whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light onto the world for decades to come.

SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Colin Dwyer covering this assault on the actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. We're going to continue following this story as we get more details. Colin, thanks a lot.

DWYER: Thank you so much, Ari.

Police received a report that Smollett, who is black and gay, was walking in the downtown Chicago neighborhood of Streeterville around 2 a.m. local time ""when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" the city's police department told NPR. ""The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.""

The alleged assault did not end there.

""At some point during the incident,"" police added, ""one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

Authorities say the two attackers fled on foot. Chicago police say they are gathering video, identifying potential witnesses and trying to establish a timeline of events.

Police put out a call for anyone who had been in the area at the time to submit information to their tip line.

Smollett's mother is African-American and his father is Jewish. In a 2016 interview, he calls his family ""blu-ish — black and Jewish.""

On Fox's Empire, Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, a young gay man trying to win his music mogul father's approval.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to NPR that it was ""deeply saddened and outraged"" at the news.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

In Chicago, the actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted in the early hours of this morning. Chicago police have confirmed that they are treating the attack as a possible hate crime. Smollett is gay and multiracial. He stars in the hit Fox TV drama ""Empire."" It's about a family that owns a music company, and Smollett plays Jamal, a gay character struggling to win his father's approval. Here he is singing on the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""EMPIRE"")

JUSSIE SMOLLETT: (As Jamal Lyon, singing) So what? I'm gay. It don't matter. God ain't made you no better than me. When I pray...

SHAPIRO: For more on this attack, NPR's Colin Dwyer joins us now. Hi, Colin.

COLIN DWYER, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.

SHAPIRO: What can you tell us so far about this assault? And what do we know happened?

DWYER: So to start off, I must preface this with the fact that details remain a little bit sketchy at the moment, but we do know some facts from the Chicago Police Department. They say that he was walking down by the waterfront section of downtown Chicago when two individuals assailed him. They started hurling racial epithets at him, started hurling homophobic slurs at him as well. And they gained his attention through that, and they started beating him up.

And at this point, there are some actually disturbing details in the police report. They say that he had an unknown chemical substance poured on him during the course of this thing. And then before that attack was done, the two individuals apparently wrapped a rope around his neck, according to police. Those individuals actually fled on foot. And now the police are trying to find out who they are.

SHAPIRO: You mentioned homophobic and racial slurs. Police are investigating this as a hate crime. Tell us more about that.

DWYER: That's correct. So they obviously see this as a potential situation in which this was either racially motivated or motivated through homophobia or perhaps both it seems. So police are now calling out to the country as a whole asking for tips on who these two people might be. One bright side to this is that it does seem that Smollett is feeling OK. He's in good condition, according to the police. He actually brought himself over to the hospital shortly after this. And he seems to be in good condition.

SHAPIRO: He brought himself to the hospital. He was not taken there by ambulance or anything.

DWYER: That's correct.

SHAPIRO: He's a very popular figure in Hollywood. I've seen a huge response on social media today. Tell us more about what the reaction has been.

DWYER: That's right. So almost immediately the moment that this news broke, we saw an outpouring from his colleagues and co-workers and friends across the industry. That includes Kerry Washington, Viola Davis. The co-creator of the show, Danny Strong, actually came out with some really strong words. He said whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light onto the world for decades to come.

SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Colin Dwyer covering this assault on the actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. We're going to continue following this story as we get more details. Colin, thanks a lot.

DWYER: Thank you so much, Ari.

CHICAGO – A cast member on the hit television show “Empire” alleged he was physically attacked by men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs, police said Tuesday.

Police did not release the actor’s name but a statement from Fox, which airs “Empire,” identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36, who plays Jamal Lyon on the show. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime.

According to a police statement, Smollett was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an “unknown substance” on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the two men, who were wearing masks, fled the scene. Authorities have not identified any suspects, and Guglielmi said detectives are gathering security footage from nearby buildings and trying to find witnesses.

Smollett was able to take himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, police said. He was last reported in good condition.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Tuesday in support of Smollett. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence,” the statement read.

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels also voiced his support for Smollett in an Instagram video.

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” Daniels said. “You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.”

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

“He is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I’ve ever met,” Harris said Tuesday, adding that she’s still learning more details about the incident.

Smollett’s role as the gay son of a record company mogul in the drama propelled him to fame after it debuted four years ago. Smollett, who is gay, has been active in LBGTQ issues. He also released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

“Empire” is shot in Chicago and a Fox spokeswoman said the program is currently in production."

Liberty is going through ""comfort dog"" training at Hero Pups in Exeter and when she graduates, will be the first certified comfort dog used by a police department in the state.

On Tuesday, state lawmakers got a special visit from Liberty as they considered a bill that would make it legal for Liberty to sit with victims, especially children when they take the witness stand in a courtroom.

""Her main mission really is to help people who have been victims of violent crimes,"" said Concord Police Lt. John Thomas.

Advocates for the bill included Rep. Skip Berrien who is a retired pediatrician.

""This animal can mitigate the child's stress allowing the child to provide more accurate and credible testimony,"" Berrien told the committee.

Thomas says when appropriate, Liberty will accompany officers to crime scenes, or even car crashes, though her job will be far different than that of a police patrol dog.

""You have the dog that;s working, that's really trying to do real police work, sniff out drugs and find the bad guys, where Liberty, she's just going to lick you to death,"" Thomas explained.

Rep. Anita Burroughs who used to have a therapy dog spoke to the committee in support of HB 513, appropriately named, ""Liberty's Bill.""

""People who've never had a dog don't understand the full powers of a dog,"" Burroughs told NBC10 Boston. ""I'm prejudiced, I think they're magical.""

Liberty will also play an important role back at the police station – providing comfort even for officers who didn't know they needed it.

""Some of our big tough husky guys, when they first saw this dog they melted,"" Thomas said. ""They never realized how powerful that the dog could be for them.""

Liberty's handlers say she's the perfect dog to be helping trauma victims — because she experienced trauma of her own.

Last summer, when she was just nine weeks old, she was rescued from severe flooding in Pennsylvania and brought up to Hero Pups in New Hampshire.

Opponents of Liberty's Bill say they're concerned the dog could snap at someone in a courtroom.

Regardless of how lawmakers vote on the bill, Liberty will join the Concord Police Department as soon as she graduates her comfort dog training in May."

Jussie Smollett was ‘brutally beaten’ in an alleged hate crime, with two men ‘putting a noose around his neck and pouring bleach on him’.

The Empire actor was reportedly set upon on in the early hours of this morning as he headed out in Chicago, with attackers ‘branding him a f***** and beating him up’, before screaming: ‘This is MAGA country.’

And the 35-year-old’s injuries were apparent in a picture shared on social media, as he shared a video-chat with boss Lee Daniels.

His face also appeared to be swollen and bruised.

Jussie was taken to hospital after being attacked by two men ‘in ski masks’ late last night, according to TMZ.

He landed in Chicago yesterday, and headed to Subway for food at around 2am, when he was approached by two men.

The attackers reportedly asked him: ‘Aren’t you that f****t Empire n*****?’ before beating him, ‘putting a rope around his neck and pouring bleach on him’.

The star attempted to fight them off but they overpowered him, reportedly screaming: ‘This is MAGA country,’ as they walked away.

He later sought treatment at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and was found to have fractured a rib.

The Chicago Police Department have confirmed they are looking into the incident.

Following the reports, Lee was one of the first to share his support on social media, posting an emotional video on Instagram, urging the actor to ‘hold his head up’.

‘It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie, you are my son,’ he began.

‘You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called, “die f*****n*****,” or whatever they said to you.

‘You are better than that, we are better than that. America is better than that.’

He continued: ‘It starts at home. It starts at home, yo we have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows we are united on a united front, and no racist fuck can come in and do the things they did to you.

‘Hold your head up, Jussie. I’m with you, I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another fucking day in America.’

Katy Perry, Ariana Grande and Thandie Newton were some of the others to offer Jussie their support after the attack.

Who is Jussie Smollett?

The 35-year-old African American is best known for his portrayal of musician Jamal Lyon in the Fox hip-hop musical drama series Empire, for which he received great acclaim.

Smollett has also appeared in Ridley Scott's science fiction film Alien: Covenant as Ricks and in Marshall as Langston Hughes.

He began his career as a child actor in 1987 starring in commercials and films, including The Mighty Ducks in 1992 and Rob Reiner's North in 1994.

Jussie came out as gay in March 2015 during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

Was the Empire star attacked in hate crime in Chicago?

Jussie Smollett was taken to hospital in Chicago at 2am on Tuesday, January 29, after two men allegedly put a noose around his neck.

The two unknown assailants, police said, began a ""possible racially motivated"" attack, yelling racial and gay slurs.

The attacker was said to have hit him in the face, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives previously released CCTV footage of the suspected attackers.

But then the Chicago Police Department said ""the trajectory of the investigation"" shifted after two men were released without charge.

The two men, Nigerian brothers Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, were later released after new evidence emerged during the investigation.

Cops said they were no longer suspects in the case.

They then wanted to reinterview Smollett for a follow-up — but the actor's lawyers said he felt ""victimised"" by reports that he may have been involved in the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying"", a statement from law firm Todd Pugh and Victor P Henderson said.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

Cops say the gay black actor PAID two friends to carry out the “attack”.

Detectives quizzed him after suggesting he staged the elaborate assault, possibly in a bizarre bid to boost his career.

A Grand Jury, which decides whether someone should be indicted for a serious crime, was notified it would hear testimony as early alleging Smollett filed a false police report, according to law enforcement sources

Just days earlier, and before the shock twist in the story emerged, A-listers had flooded social media with their ­support for the 36-year-old.

Smollett was in custody and could have faced three years in jail after he was sensationally charged with lying over a ""racist attack"".

Cops raised concerns over the gay black actor's story - amid suggestions he staged it in a bizarre bid to boost his career.

Chicago Police announced Smollett had been charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report at the beginning of March.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter: ""Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report.

""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.""

Guglielmi added: ""Jussie Smollet is under arrest and in custody of detectives.""

Smollett would have faced up to three years in prison if convicted under Illinois law.

Responding to the charge, Smollett's lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said they planned to mount an ""aggressive defence"".

Smollett paid two men £3,000 to get him in shape for a music video, and not to fake a racist attack, the pair have claimed.

The Empire actor was accused of paying brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo to stage a hoax racist attack on him to get attention.

But the brothers claim the cash was for them to train him for five weeks after Smollett ""wanted abs like his"", reported TMZ.

Both Abel and Ola agreed to train Jussie, and also give him a five-week nutrition plan, they reportedly say.

A few days before the alleged ""attack"", Smollett paid the two men with the cheque's memo reading ""5 weeks training nutrition plan"".

What's the latest?

As of November 20, 2019 the actor is suing the city of Chicago for malicious prosecution.

On March 26, Smollett had all charges against him dropped by US prosecutors.

Smollett's attorneys Tina Glandian and Patricia Brown Holmes said in a statement that their client's record has now ""been wiped clean.""

Following the announcement, an emotional Smollett said: “I have been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one.

“I would not be my mother’s son if I was capable of one drop of what I had been accused of. This has been an incredibly difficult time – honestly one of the worst of my entire life.

“But I am a man of faith and a man who has knowledge of my history and I would not bring my family our lives or the movement through a fire like this – I just wouldn’t.""

Smollett's co-star Taraji P Henson told USA Today: ""I’m happy that the truth has finally been set free, because I knew it all along. We’re all happy for him, and thank God the truth prevailed.”

Meanwhile the city's mayor revealed his disappointment about the prosecutors' decision to drop the charges as a ""whitewash of justice"".

It still remains unclear why prosecutors dropped the charges against him.

Though police provide the state's attorney office with evidence, it is ultimately up to prosecutors whether to pursue a case.

Smollett voluntarily agreed to give up his $10,000 (£7,500) bail money and his lawyer insists there had been no deal with state prosecutors.

Smollett has been sued for £100,000 to cover the cost of the police investigation into his false claims he was assaulted by two men - and it could prove he DID fake the racist attack if he appeals.

Police have sued for ""diverting resources from other investigations and undermining the criminal justice system"".

Smollet's defence team responded to the letter stating that the City owes Smollett an apology, saying: ""Jussie has paid enough"".

If he chooses to fight the matter in court, a judge will have to go over his case again and decide whether or not the attack was faked.

But this time the standards of proof will be much lower - meaning it will be much easier to get a guilty verdict.

The trial will take place in a civil court, so it will only need to be proved ""more likely than not"" that Smollett faked the attack.

In a criminal case, like Smollett's previous trial, proof needs to be ""beyond a reasonable doubt"".

So Smollett could now easily be found to be lying about the alleged attack he says took place in January.

DRUG CLAIMS

Smollett told officers he has a drug problem as they arrested him, according to US reports.

Cops later said the Empire actor bought ecstasy from an alleged accomplice suspected of pretending to be an attacker in the hoax.

During his arrest he reportedly told officers he struggled with drugs and had never been treated.

And text messages that emerged later appear to show Jussie asking colleague Abel Osundairo for ecstasy.

Jussie is understood to have sent him a series of messages asking to buy ""Molly"", which is commonly known as ecstasy, TMZ reports.

Smollett told his 1.4million Twitter followers that ""frauds are everywhere"" just two days before allegedly staging a ""racist"" attack in a bid to boost his career.

The disgraced Empire actor also warned fans not to ""look for fame"" and joked about ""whooping your own ass"" in tweets that have since been branded ""ironic"".

The tweet went on to advise followers to stay away from drugs, which may also appear hypocritical in light of reports Smollett told cops he had a drug problem as he was arrested.

It added: ""Salt, cocaine and anthrax can all appear to be sugar...(the “refined” kind of course) just be careful out here fam.""

He was obviously already laying the foundation for all this. Twitter User Replying To Smollett's Tweet

Followers were quick to blast the actor, branding him ""hilariously stupid"" for writing the tweet so close to the 'hoax'.

One user observed he posted the tweet around the time he was allegedly planning the fake ""attack on himself"".

""That makes it even more hilarious stupid,"" the user said. ""He was obviously already laying the foundation for all this.

""Either that, or guilt was eating him up and he hadn't even played the part yet.""

Another replied saying it ""sounds like you could take your own advice"", while a different user joked: ""He was giving us fair warning!"".

What has the creator of Empire Lee Daniels said of the attack?

Empire creator Lee Daniels has said ""America is better than that"" after the show's star was injured in a potential hate crime.

He said the incident was ""just another f***ing day in America"" and urged the nation to improve.

Speaking in a video on Instagram, an emotional Daniels said: ""You didn't deserve, nor does anybody deserve, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called 'die f***ing, n*****' or whatever they said to you.

""You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that.

""It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.""

Halle Berry also took to Twitter to condemn the alleged attack, declaring that her ""heart is hurting knowing that he's suffering"".

She added: ""The fact his presence on this earth would be perceived as a threat to anyone only shows the magnitude of their fear and confusion.

""I pray that our country learns to heal, that we may see each other for WHO we are and nothing more.""

Ariana Grande wrote: ""What happened to Jussie makes me really f***ing sick to my stomach.

""I can’t believe shit like this is really still happening everyday. What kind of world ?

Jussie Smollett, one of the stars of the TV show Empire, reportedly was brutally attacked early Tuesday in what Chicago police are investigating as a possible hate crime. The 36-year-old actor took himself to the hospital directly after what police called a ""possible racially-charged assault and battery""; authorities say he is in good condition.

Police received a report that Smollett, who is black and gay, was walking in the downtown Chicago neighborhood of Streeterville around 2 a.m. local time ""when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" the city's police department told NPR. ""The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.""

Authorities say the two attackers fled on foot. Chicago police say they are gathering video, identifying potential witnesses and trying to establish a timeline of events.

Police put out a call for anyone who had been in the area at the time to submit information to their tip line.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

In Chicago, the actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted in the early hours of this morning. Chicago police have confirmed that they are treating the attack as a possible hate crime. Smollett is gay and multiracial. He stars in the hit Fox TV drama ""Empire."" It's about a family that owns a music company, and Smollett plays Jamal, a gay character struggling to win his father's approval. Here he is singing on the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""EMPIRE"")

JUSSIE SMOLLETT: (As Jamal Lyon, singing) So what? I'm gay. It don't matter. God ain't made you no better than me. When I pray...

SHAPIRO: For more on this attack, NPR's Colin Dwyer joins us now. Hi, Colin.

COLIN DWYER, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.

SHAPIRO: What can you tell us so far about this assault? And what do we know happened?

DWYER: So to start off, I must preface this with the fact that details remain a little bit sketchy at the moment, but we do know some facts from the Chicago Police Department. They say that he was walking down by the waterfront section of downtown Chicago when two individuals assailed him. They started hurling racial epithets at him, started hurling homophobic slurs at him as well. And they gained his attention through that, and they started beating him up.

And at this point, there are some actually disturbing details in the police report. They say that he had an unknown chemical substance poured on him during the course of this thing. And then before that attack was done, the two individuals apparently wrapped a rope around his neck, according to police. Those individuals actually fled on foot. And now the police are trying to find out who they are.

SHAPIRO: You mentioned homophobic and racial slurs. Police are investigating this as a hate crime. Tell us more about that.

DWYER: That's correct. So they obviously see this as a potential situation in which this was either racially motivated or motivated through homophobia or perhaps both it seems. So police are now calling out to the country as a whole asking for tips on who these two people might be. One bright side to this is that it does seem that Smollett is feeling OK. He's in good condition, according to the police. He actually brought himself over to the hospital shortly after this. And he seems to be in good condition.

SHAPIRO: He brought himself to the hospital. He was not taken there by ambulance or anything.

DWYER: That's correct.

SHAPIRO: He's a very popular figure in Hollywood. I've seen a huge response on social media today. Tell us more about what the reaction has been.

DWYER: That's right. So almost immediately the moment that this news broke, we saw an outpouring from his colleagues and co-workers and friends across the industry. That includes Kerry Washington, Viola Davis. The co-creator of the show, Danny Strong, actually came out with some really strong words. He said whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light onto the world for decades to come.

SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Colin Dwyer covering this assault on the actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. We're going to continue following this story as we get more details. Colin, thanks a lot.

DWYER: Thank you so much, Ari.

Was the Empire star attacked in hate crime in Chicago?

Jussie Smollett was taken to hospital in Chicago at 2am on Tuesday, January 29, after two men allegedly put a noose around his neck.

The two unknown assailants, police said, began a ""possible racially motivated"" attack, yelling racial and gay slurs.

The attacker was said to have hit him in the face, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives previously released CCTV footage of the suspected attackers.

Cops later said the Empire actor bought ecstasy from an alleged accomplice suspected of pretending to be an attacker in the hoax.

During his arrest he reportedly told officers he struggled with drugs and had never been treated.

And text messages that emerged later appear to show Jussie asking colleague Abel Osundairo for ecstasy.

Jussie is understood to have sent him a series of messages asking to buy ""Molly"", which is commonly known as ecstasy, TMZ reports.

Smollett told his 1.4million Twitter followers that ""frauds are everywhere"" just two days before allegedly staging a ""racist"" attack in a bid to boost his career.

The disgraced Empire actor also warned fans not to ""look for fame"" and joked about ""whooping your own ass"" in tweets that have since been branded ""ironic"".

The tweet went on to advise followers to stay away from drugs, which may also appear hypocritical in light of reports Smollett told cops he had a drug problem as he was arrested.

It added: ""Salt, cocaine and anthrax can all appear to be sugar...(the “refined” kind of course) just be careful out here fam.""

He was obviously already laying the foundation for all this. Twitter User Replying To Smollett's Tweet

Followers were quick to blast the actor, branding him ""hilariously stupid"" for writing the tweet so close to the 'hoax'.

One user observed he posted the tweet around the time he was allegedly planning the fake ""attack on himself"".

""That makes it even more hilarious stupid,"" the user said. ""He was obviously already laying the foundation for all this.

""Either that, or guilt was eating him up and he hadn't even played the part yet.""

Another replied saying it ""sounds like you could take your own advice"", while a different user joked: ""He was giving us fair warning!"".

What has the creator of Empire Lee Daniels said of the attack?

Empire creator Lee Daniels has said ""America is better than that"" after the show's star was injured in a potential hate crime.

He said the incident was ""just another f***ing day in America"" and urged the nation to improve.

Speaking in a video on Instagram, an emotional Daniels said: ""You didn't deserve, nor does anybody deserve, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called 'die f***ing, n*****' or whatever they said to you.

""You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that.

""It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.""

Halle Berry also took to Twitter to condemn the alleged attack, declaring that her ""heart is hurting knowing that he's suffering"".

She added: ""The fact his presence on this earth would be perceived as a threat to anyone only shows the magnitude of their fear and confusion.

""I pray that our country learns to heal, that we may see each other for WHO we are and nothing more.""

Ariana Grande wrote: ""What happened to Jussie makes me really f***ing sick to my stomach.

""I can’t believe shit like this is really still happening everyday. What kind of world ?

""I hope we can find an end to the hate and fear that plagues this country. Praying for your recovery, Jussie.""

And Zendaya said: ""This is heartbreaking and terrifying...please pay attention to what’s happening here.""

Katy Perry was also one of many other celebrities - including Janet Jackson and Michael B Jordan - to offer their condolences and disgust at the act.

She wrote: ""Standing with and sending love to @JussieSmollett today... this is a racist hate crime and is disgusting and shameful to our country.""

British lawmakers instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to demand that Brussels replace the Irish border arrangement known as the “backstop”, in a last-ditch attempt to renegotiate an exit treaty that the European Union says it will not change.

The amendment, put forward by influential Conservative lawmaker Graham Brady, passed by 317 votes to 301, and is intended to strengthen May’s hand when she returns to Brussels to try to renegotiate – something the EU again ruled out within minutes of the vote.

With two months left until Britain is due by law to leave the EU, investors and allies have urged the British government to clinch a deal to allow an orderly exit from the club it joined in 1973.

The amendment calls for the backstop to be replaced with unspecified “alternative arrangements” to avoid the reintroduction of border checks in Ireland, and says parliament would support May’s Brexit deal if this change were made.

Huawei's Meng Wanzhou appears in court as Canada mulls US extradition

Huawei Technologies' chief financial officer, the central figure in a high-stakes dispute between the world's two largest economies, made her first appearance in a Canadian court in more than a month as Ottawa weighs extraditing the Chinese executive to the United States.

Meng Wanzhou, daughter of the Chinese telecommunications company's founder, attended the hearing in British Columbia Supreme Court during which Justice William Ehrcke approved her request for a change in who is financially responsible for her bail.

Canada arrested Meng on Dec 1 at the request of the United States, which on Monday brought sweeping charges against Huawei and Meng that paint the company as a threat to US national security. Meng was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran.

China likely to step up militarisation in South China Sea: US intelligence report

China is likely to continue to increase its maritime presence in the South China Sea and build military and dual-use infrastructure in the Spratly Islands to improve its ability to control access and project power, a newly-released American intelligence assessment of global threats warned.

Beijing seeks to influence the politics and economies of countries in its backyard, and is expected to increase its engagement in South-east Asia to build its influence while diminishing the influence of the US and its allies, said the annual report submitted to the US Senate.

It said that in the coming year, China and Russia would compete more intensively with the United States and its allies and partners in an expansive race for technological and military superiority, thus presenting greater threats to US national security.

Smollett, 35, was walking on the 300th block of E. North Lower Water Street around 2am local time on Tuesday, ""when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a statement to The Washington Post.

Authorities say the two attackers fled on foot. Chicago police say they are gathering video, identifying potential witnesses and trying to establish a timeline of events.

Police put out a call for anyone who had been in the area at the time to submit information to their tip line.

Smollett's mother is African-American and his father is Jewish. In a 2016 interview, he calls his family ""blu-ish — black and Jewish.""

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to NPR that it was ""deeply saddened and outraged"" at the news. ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

In Chicago, the actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted in the early hours of this morning. Chicago police have confirmed that they are treating the attack as a possible hate crime. Smollett is gay and multiracial. He stars in the hit Fox TV drama ""Empire."" It's about a family that owns a music company, and Smollett plays Jamal, a gay character struggling to win his father's approval. Here he is singing on the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""EMPIRE"")

JUSSIE SMOLLETT: (As Jamal Lyon, singing) So what? I'm gay. It don't matter. God ain't made you no better than me. When I pray...

SHAPIRO: For more on this attack, NPR's Colin Dwyer joins us now. Hi, Colin.

COLIN DWYER, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.

SHAPIRO: What can you tell us so far about this assault? And what do we know happened?

DWYER: So to start off, I must preface this with the fact that details remain a little bit sketchy at the moment, but we do know some facts from the Chicago Police Department. They say that he was walking down by the waterfront section of downtown Chicago when two individuals assailed him. They started hurling racial epithets at him, started hurling homophobic slurs at him as well. And they gained his attention through that, and they started beating him up.

And at this point, there are some actually disturbing details in the police report. They say that he had an unknown chemical substance poured on him during the course of this thing. And then before that attack was done, the two individuals apparently wrapped a rope around his neck, according to police. Those individuals actually fled on foot. And now the police are trying to find out who they are.

SHAPIRO: You mentioned homophobic and racial slurs. Police are investigating this as a hate crime. Tell us more about that.

DWYER: That's correct. So they obviously see this as a potential situation in which this was either racially motivated or motivated through homophobia or perhaps both it seems. So police are now calling out to the country as a whole asking for tips on who these two people might be. One bright side to this is that it does seem that Smollett is feeling OK. He's in good condition, according to the police. He actually brought himself over to the hospital shortly after this. And he seems to be in good condition.

SHAPIRO: He brought himself to the hospital. He was not taken there by ambulance or anything.

DWYER: That's correct.

SHAPIRO: He's a very popular figure in Hollywood. I've seen a huge response on social media today. Tell us more about what the reaction has been.

DWYER: That's right. So almost immediately the moment that this news broke, we saw an outpouring from his colleagues and co-workers and friends across the industry. That includes Kerry Washington, Viola Davis. The co-creator of the show, Danny Strong, actually came out with some really strong words. He said whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light onto the world for decades to come.

SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Colin Dwyer covering this assault on the actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. We're going to continue following this story as we get more details. Colin, thanks a lot.

DWYER: Thank you so much, Ari.

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett was brutally attacked by 2 men who beat him up, put his head in a noose and screamed, “This is MAGA country.” Sources directly connected to Jussie tell TMZ, the actor arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday, and at around 2 AM he was hungry and went to a Subway. We’re told when shortly after he walked out on his way home, someone yelled, “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****?” The 2 men — both white and wearing ski masks — viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

Also per TMZ, a letter threatening Smollett was received by Fox Studios in Chicago studio 8 days ago :

""Jussie Smollett You will die black fag"" Okay, I'm ready to fight. pic.twitter.com/h42Px47lvW — ℝ𝕚𝕔𝕙 ℍ𝕠𝕞𝕠 ℚ𝕦𝕒𝕟 (@Homiekage) January 29, 2019

No doubt this is deeply disturbing news. But in their rush to cover this story, one thing some media outlets have gotten wrong in their early reporting is the “MAGA shouting/white guys” angle.

Robby Soave at Reason posted a huge scoop on this developing story earlier today:

“According to the victim, the offenders’ faces were concealed,” a police spokesperson told Reason. “We have no record indicating that [they shouted ‘MAGA’], we only have record of them shouting racial and homophobic slurs at him.” Chicago police have also released a statement contradicting claims that Smollett identified his attackers’ race and heard them shout “MAGA.” “We have no record of The MAGA Country comment,” said the police in a statement. “We have racial and homophobic comments documented.”

Even without a MAGA shouting/white guys component to this story, what Smollett – who has reportedly already been discharged from the hospital – said happened to him is absolutely horrific. If the story is accurate, the perps should absolutely be punished to the fullest extent of the law.

However, in the mad dash to get to the bottom of the allegations in order find out what happened and who committed the alleged acts, the national press needs to keep itself in check on this and have all their facts in order before rushing to social media to report on what they’ve found out.

We don’t need to end up having another false narrative a la the Covington High School kids. Yes, this is a different kind of story, but the same news-gathering rules apply. Facts First and all that. This is a good opportunity for the MSM to show that they’ve learned their lesson.

Will the live up to the challenge? Stay tuned.

Who is Jussie Smollett?

The 35-year-old African American is best known for his portrayal of musician Jamal Lyon in the Fox hip-hop musical drama series Empire, for which he received great acclaim.

Smollett has also appeared in Ridley Scott's science fiction film Alien: Covenant as Ricks and in Marshall as Langston Hughes.

He began his career as a child actor in 1987 starring in commercials and films, including The Mighty Ducks in 1992 and Rob Reiner's North in 1994.

Jussie came out as gay in March 2015 during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

Was the Empire star attacked in hate crime in Chicago?

Jussie Smollett was taken to hospital in Chicago at 2am on Tuesday, January 29, after two men allegedly put a noose around his neck.

The two unknown assailants, police said, began a ""possible racially motivated"" attack, yelling racial and gay slurs.

The attacker was said to have hit him in the face, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives previously released CCTV footage of the suspected attackers.

But then the Chicago Police Department said ""the trajectory of the investigation"" shifted after two men were released without charge.

The two men, Nigerian brothers Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, were later released after new evidence emerged during the investigation.

Cops said they were no longer suspects in the case.

They then wanted to reinterview Smollett for a follow-up — but the actor's lawyers said he felt ""victimised"" by reports that he may have been involved in the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying"", a statement from law firm Todd Pugh and Victor P Henderson said.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

Cops say the gay black actor PAID two friends to carry out the “attack”.

Detectives quizzed him after suggesting he staged the elaborate assault, possibly in a bizarre bid to boost his career.

A Grand Jury, which decides whether someone should be indicted for a serious crime, was notified it would hear testimony as early alleging Smollett filed a false police report, according to law enforcement sources

Just days earlier, and before the shock twist in the story emerged, A-listers had flooded social media with their ­support for the 36-year-old.

Smollett was in custody and could have faced three years in jail after he was sensationally charged with lying over a ""racist attack"".

Cops raised concerns over the gay black actor's story - amid suggestions he staged it in a bizarre bid to boost his career.

Chicago Police announced Smollett had been charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report at the beginning of March.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter: ""Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report.

""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.""

Guglielmi added: ""Jussie Smollet is under arrest and in custody of detectives.""

Smollett would have faced up to three years in prison if convicted under Illinois law.

Responding to the charge, Smollett's lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said they planned to mount an ""aggressive defence"".

Smollett paid two men £3,000 to get him in shape for a music video, and not to fake a racist attack, the pair have claimed.

The Empire actor was accused of paying brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo to stage a hoax racist attack on him to get attention.

But the brothers claim the cash was for them to train him for five weeks after Smollett ""wanted abs like his"", reported TMZ.

Both Abel and Ola agreed to train Jussie, and also give him a five-week nutrition plan, they reportedly say.

A few days before the alleged ""attack"", Smollett paid the two men with the cheque's memo reading ""5 weeks training nutrition plan"".

What's the latest?

As of November 20, 2019 the actor is suing the city of Chicago for malicious prosecution.

On March 26, Smollett had all charges against him dropped by US prosecutors.

Smollett's attorneys Tina Glandian and Patricia Brown Holmes said in a statement that their client's record has now ""been wiped clean.""

Following the announcement, an emotional Smollett said: “I have been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one.

“I would not be my mother’s son if I was capable of one drop of what I had been accused of. This has been an incredibly difficult time – honestly one of the worst of my entire life.

“But I am a man of faith and a man who has knowledge of my history and I would not bring my family our lives or the movement through a fire like this – I just wouldn’t.""

Smollett's co-star Taraji P Henson told USA Today: ""I’m happy that the truth has finally been set free, because I knew it all along. We’re all happy for him, and thank God the truth prevailed.”

Meanwhile the city's mayor revealed his disappointment about the prosecutors' decision to drop the charges as a ""whitewash of justice"".

It still remains unclear why prosecutors dropped the charges against him.

Though police provide the state's attorney office with evidence, it is ultimately up to prosecutors whether to pursue a case.

Smollett voluntarily agreed to give up his $10,000 (£7,500) bail money and his lawyer insists there had been no deal with state prosecutors.

Smollett has been sued for £100,000 to cover the cost of the police investigation into his false claims he was assaulted by two men - and it could prove he DID fake the racist attack if he appeals.

Police have sued for ""diverting resources from other investigations and undermining the criminal justice system"".

Smollet's defence team responded to the letter stating that the City owes Smollett an apology, saying: ""Jussie has paid enough"".

If he chooses to fight the matter in court, a judge will have to go over his case again and decide whether or not the attack was faked.

But this time the standards of proof will be much lower - meaning it will be much easier to get a guilty verdict.

The trial will take place in a civil court, so it will only need to be proved ""more likely than not"" that Smollett faked the attack.

In a criminal case, like Smollett's previous trial, proof needs to be ""beyond a reasonable doubt"".

So Smollett could now easily be found to be lying about the alleged attack he says took place in January.

DRUG CLAIMS

Smollett told officers he has a drug problem as they arrested him, according to US reports.

Cops later said the Empire actor bought ecstasy from an alleged accomplice suspected of pretending to be an attacker in the hoax.

During his arrest he reportedly told officers he struggled with drugs and had never been treated.

And text messages that emerged later appear to show Jussie asking colleague Abel Osundairo for ecstasy.

Jussie is understood to have sent him a series of messages asking to buy ""Molly"", which is commonly known as ecstasy, TMZ reports.

Smollett told his 1.4million Twitter followers that ""frauds are everywhere"" just two days before allegedly staging a ""racist"" attack in a bid to boost his career.

The disgraced Empire actor also warned fans not to ""look for fame"" and joked about ""whooping your own ass"" in tweets that have since been branded ""ironic"".

The tweet went on to advise followers to stay away from drugs, which may also appear hypocritical in light of reports Smollett told cops he had a drug problem as he was arrested.

It added: ""Salt, cocaine and anthrax can all appear to be sugar...(the “refined” kind of course) just be careful out here fam.""

He was obviously already laying the foundation for all this. Twitter User Replying To Smollett's Tweet

Followers were quick to blast the actor, branding him ""hilariously stupid"" for writing the tweet so close to the 'hoax'.

One user observed he posted the tweet around the time he was allegedly planning the fake ""attack on himself"".

""That makes it even more hilarious stupid,"" the user said. ""He was obviously already laying the foundation for all this.

""Either that, or guilt was eating him up and he hadn't even played the part yet.""

Another replied saying it ""sounds like you could take your own advice"", while a different user joked: ""He was giving us fair warning!"".

What has the creator of Empire Lee Daniels said of the attack?

Empire creator Lee Daniels has said ""America is better than that"" after the show's star was injured in a potential hate crime.

He said the incident was ""just another f***ing day in America"" and urged the nation to improve.

Speaking in a video on Instagram, an emotional Daniels said: ""You didn't deserve, nor does anybody deserve, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called 'die f***ing, n*****' or whatever they said to you.

""You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that.

""It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.""

Halle Berry also took to Twitter to condemn the alleged attack, declaring that her ""heart is hurting knowing that he's suffering"".

She added: ""The fact his presence on this earth would be perceived as a threat to anyone only shows the magnitude of their fear and confusion.

""I pray that our country learns to heal, that we may see each other for WHO we are and nothing more.""

Ariana Grande wrote: ""What happened to Jussie makes me really f***ing sick to my stomach.

""I can’t believe shit like this is really still happening everyday. What kind of world ?

“@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery,” the California senator wrote on Twitter.

“This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

Chicago cops on Tuesday collected footage from city and private video cameras looking for leads in what they called a “possible racially-charged assault and battery” on the African-American Smollett, The Chicago Tribune reported.

Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on the Fox show, said two people approached him at about 2 a.m. Tuesday as he was walking to get something to eat and got his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

Smollett was hit and an unknown chemical substance was poured on him, cops told the paper, and a rope was wrapped around his neck before the attackers fled.

Smollett took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital and was said to be in “good condition.”

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline,” CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to the paper.

“Empire” is recorded in Chicago for most of the year.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

In Chicago, the actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted in the early hours of this morning. Chicago police have confirmed that they are treating the attack as a possible hate crime. Smollett is gay and multiracial. He stars in the hit Fox TV drama ""Empire."" It's about a family that owns a music company, and Smollett plays Jamal, a gay character struggling to win his father's approval. Here he is singing on the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""EMPIRE"")

JUSSIE SMOLLETT: (As Jamal Lyon, singing) So what? I'm gay. It don't matter. God ain't made you no better than me. When I pray...

SHAPIRO: For more on this attack, NPR's Colin Dwyer joins us now. Hi, Colin.

COLIN DWYER, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.

SHAPIRO: What can you tell us so far about this assault? And what do we know happened?

DWYER: So to start off, I must preface this with the fact that details remain a little bit sketchy at the moment, but we do know some facts from the Chicago Police Department. They say that he was walking down by the waterfront section of downtown Chicago when two individuals assailed him. They started hurling racial epithets at him, started hurling homophobic slurs at him as well. And they gained his attention through that, and they started beating him up.

And at this point, there are some actually disturbing details in the police report. They say that he had an unknown chemical substance poured on him during the course of this thing. And then before that attack was done, the two individuals apparently wrapped a rope around his neck, according to police. Those individuals actually fled on foot. And now the police are trying to find out who they are.

SHAPIRO: You mentioned homophobic and racial slurs. Police are investigating this as a hate crime. Tell us more about that.

DWYER: That's correct. So they obviously see this as a potential situation in which this was either racially motivated or motivated through homophobia or perhaps both it seems. So police are now calling out to the country as a whole asking for tips on who these two people might be. One bright side to this is that it does seem that Smollett is feeling OK. He's in good condition, according to the police. He actually brought himself over to the hospital shortly after this. And he seems to be in good condition.

SHAPIRO: He brought himself to the hospital. He was not taken there by ambulance or anything.

DWYER: That's correct.

SHAPIRO: He's a very popular figure in Hollywood. I've seen a huge response on social media today. Tell us more about what the reaction has been.

DWYER: That's right. So almost immediately the moment that this news broke, we saw an outpouring from his colleagues and co-workers and friends across the industry. That includes Kerry Washington, Viola Davis. The co-creator of the show, Danny Strong, actually came out with some really strong words. He said whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light onto the world for decades to come.

SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Colin Dwyer covering this assault on the actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. We're going to continue following this story as we get more details. Colin, thanks a lot.

DWYER: Thank you so much, Ari.

‘Empire’ star Jussie Smollett has been violently attacked in an apparent homophobic and racist hate crime that left him hospitalized.

The 35-year-old, who came out as gay to Ellen in 2015, was set upon by two men in ski masks at 2am on Tuesday in Chicago, ThatGrapeJuice.Net reports.

A photo of Smollett, which showed him still in his hospital bed, reveals the actor’s bruised and swollen face. The picture, taken from a FaceTime conversation between Smollett and ‘Empire’ creator Lee Daniels, also showed a cut under his right eye.

Sources familiar with the show’s production told TMZ that Smollett and the rest of the cast will have armed security in the duration of their time in Chicago.

Police reports state that Smollett was walking from a local Subway sandwich shop when the two men started yelling homophobic and racial slurs, including: ‘Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****?’

The two then started beating on the actor while pouring bleach on him.

A noose was said to have been tied around his neck during the attack.

Sources close to the singer told TMZ that both of the men were white and yelled that ‘this is MAGA country.’

Smollett was admitted to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital but has since been released. He suffered a fractured rib, during the attack, and is said to have put up a fight when he was beaten.

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, date stamped from January 18, stating that ‘You will die black f*g.’

The Chicago Police Department is investigating the case as a racially-charged battery and assault. They are looking at nearby businesses for possible surveillance video.

Prior to the attack, Smollett had been stranded in LaGuardia’s Airpoty in New York for upwards of five hours while he waited for weather to become permissible in Chicago.

He would post a series of videos to his Insta-Story showing the weather in Chicago and his annoyance with waiting on the flight.

Various celebrities and fans took to social media to lend their support for the actor and to call out racism and homophobia.

This is heartbreaking and terrifying…please pay attention to what’s happening here. Sending all my love to @JussieSmollett

Reverend Al Sharpton added: ‘The reported hate attack on my friend and brother, actor Jussie Smollett is despicable and outrageous. The guilty must face the maximum.’

Smollett lives in Chicago while the popular FOX show films.

Empire follows the Lyon family as they try to maintain their dominance in the music industry. Taraji P Henson and Terrance Howard star as the main powerhouse couple in the series.

Smollett has played Jamal Lyon — an openly gay singer — for five seasons on the hit FOX series.

‘We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,’ 20th Century Fox said in a statement. ‘The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.’

Celebrities including Janet Jackson, John Legend and Lee Daniels have all rushed to offer their support in the wake of the horrifying attack.

He is additionally known for playing Terry Hall in 1992’s ‘The Mighty Ducks’. The singer and actor is also related to actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell.

Smollett has used his profile to work heavily with Little Miss Flint and getting clean water to the predominantly black Michigan town. He is also an advocate for LGBTQIA rights and is considered a close friend of the Human Rights Campaign

‘This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident. There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities — and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities,’ said HRC President Chad Griffin.

‘Last year alone, at least 26 transgender people, mostly transgender women of color, were brutally murdered. This is an unacceptable crisis, and HRC continues to press for improved reporting, passage of state laws that protect LGBTQ individuals from hate crimes, and expanded education and training initiatives.’

Derrick Johnson, NAACP President and CEO, added: ‘The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling.

‘The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric. It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse.

‘As this rhetoric continues to bleed into our everyday lives, dangerous behavior will continue to place many law-abiding individuals at risk. We pray for a full physical and mental recovery Jussie Smollett and many unnamed victims of this forum of hate based terrorism.’"

Empire creator Lee Daniels has said “America is better than that” after the show’s star was injured in a potential hate crime.

Jussie Smollett, 35, was taken to hospital in Chicago at 2am on Tuesday after two men allegedly put a noose around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him in a racially motivated attack.

Police have said “homophobic slurs” were used during an attack.

Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, the gay son of a music mogul, in the Fox drama.

The show’s co-creator Daniels has said the incident was “just another f****** day in America” and urged the nation to improve.

Speaking in a video on Instagram, an emotional Daniels said: “It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie you are my son.

“You didn’t deserve, nor does anybody deserve, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die f*****, n*****’ or whatever they said to you.

“You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that.

“It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent? And at different moments...you're seeing the yin and yang of that, the positive and negative of both. Both are just trying to love this child."

One of the stars of the Fox drama series “Empire” was attacked early Tuesday morning in what Chicago police say may have been a hate crime.

Police said Jussie Smollett was attacked by two people “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,” who “poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” according to CNN.

Smollett, 36, is a former child actor who appeared in “The Mighty Ducks.” He plays Jamal Lyon on the Fox series.

“According to police, one of Smollett’s alleged attackers also put a rope around his neck. Both fled the scene,” CNN reports. “Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital and ‘is in good condition,’ police told CNN.”

In a statement, police said: “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”

Smollett reported being shaken and angry over the incident. He also told CNN that he fought back against the attackers.

In a statement, a representative for 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our ‘Empire’ family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

The CNN report notes: “Smollett has starred on Fox’s ‘Empire’ since 2015. He plays Jamal, a successful singer in the musical Lyon family. Like his character, Smollett identifies as gay.”

The actor had recently received a threatening letter using racially charged language and homophobic slurs, according to media reports.

The 35-year-old, who came out as gay to Ellen in 2015, was set upon by two men in ski masks at 2am on Tuesday in Chicago, ThatGrapeJuice.Net reports.

A photo of Smollett, which showed him still in his hospital bed, reveals the actor's bruised and swollen face. The picture, taken from a FaceTime conversation between Smollett and 'Empire' creator Lee Daniels, also showed a cut under his right eye.

The FBI is now investigating the case as a racially-charged battery and assault. They are looking at nearby businesses for possible surveillance video.

Sources familiar with the show's production told TMZ that Smollett and the rest of the cast will have armed security for the duration of their time in Chicago.

Police reports state that Smollett was walking from a local Subway sandwich shop when the two men started yelling homophobic and racial slurs, including: 'Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?'

The two then started beating on the actor while pouring bleach on him.

A noose was then tied around his neck, and Smollett was still wearing it a 2:42am when police arrived on the scene.

The Chicago Police Department also confirmed to DailyMail.com that Smollett informed them the men were screaming 'this is MAGA country' during the attack.

Smollett was admitted to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital but has since been released. He suffered a fractured rib, during the attack, and is said to have put up a fight when he was beaten.

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, dated from January 18, stating that 'You will die black f*g'

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, date stamped from January 18, stating that 'You will die black f*g.'

Prior to the attack, Smollett had been stranded in LaGuardia's Airpoty in New York for upwards of five hours while he waited for weather to become permissible in Chicago.

He posted a series of videos to his Insta-Story showing the weather in Chicago and his annoyance with waiting on the flight.

Every single Democrat who has entered the 2020 primary had issued a statement condemning the individuals who committed this act by Tuesday afternoon, with the exception of Senator Elizabeth Warren.

The White House had not said anything at all on the matter however as of 8pm on Tuesday night in Washington DC.

Many Democrats also took to social media to lend their support for the actor and to call out racism and homophobia.

Bernie Sanders wrote on Twitter: 'The racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country. We must come together to eradicate all forms of bigotry and violence.'

Senator Kamala Harris wrote: '@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.'

Fellow Democrat Pete Buttigieg tweeted: 'While the struggle for basic hate crime legislation continues here in Indiana, this horrible attack calls all Americans to stand against hatred and violence in all its forms.'

Julian Castro tweeted: '1/ If the reports of Jussie Smollett's attack last night are true, and this was a racially and homophobically-motivated attack, then God-willing, justice will be swift and thorough.

'2/ That this happens in today's America is not surprising, but it is no less heartbreaking. This shakes us to our core.'

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted: 'This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it's the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color. We are all responsible for condemning this behavior and every person who enables or normalizes it. Praying for Jussie and his family.'

The year was 1998 and at the time I lived alone in Brooklyn, a good 45 minutes from my office on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where I worked as a television producer for a talk show on PBS. Even as Byrd lived in the deep South, where deep-seated racism continued in open acts of violence and terror, I’d never heard of anything this horrific, and after that, I started looking over my shoulder more when I walked home from the subway.

The news played it up as an isolated incident, but it opened a floodgate of pent up horror and fear, anger and loyalty — a whole range of emotional dissonance. It was the rope that put me over. That Byrd’s neck had been tied to the truck, his head decapitated at about mile three. Because it’s the rope, the noose, that singular tool of violence that lives, bloodied and menacing, in the collective memory of black America.

I didn’t live through the late 1800s and early 1900s when thousands of slaves were lynched on a regular basis, but I held the imagery in my bones — through pictures of white people gathered around a black body swinging from a tree and Billie Holiday’s ""Strange Fruit"" and Emmett’s neck tied to a cotton gin fan. This was the late 1990s, though, when James Byrd, Jr. was lynched.

Now, just over twenty years later, comes an assault that could only be described as an attempted lynching and a definitive hate crime. And what I realized when news broke today that the Empire actor Jussie Smollett, while walking in Chicago early this morning, had been assaulted by two unidentified assailants, who yelled out racist and homophobic slurs before tying a noose around Smollett’s neck, is that black folks will forever be in vicious concert with the noose.

No matter the generation, how far past or urgently present, whether a 49-year-old man walking home after a night of drinking with friends, or a young, openly gay actor whose ease and clarity and accessibility on the popular culture scene makes him beloved by fans and peers alike, the noose will drop from the sky and into the hands of hate at any moment. We know what it signals, how quickly our lives can end in its taut, virulent tug.

Despite all that, nearly every media outlet who first reported on the attack referred to it as a “possible” hate crime. And that may be for those whose necks are not exposed.

The latest news reports say that Smollett, who also had an “unknown chemical” — some reports have identified it as bleach— poured on him during the attack, is in “good condition” according to police. But how will he recover from this trauma? Many of us are triggered by the mere image of a noose — Smollett has now felt one around his neck, yoked by the thick, bitter thread that history told us was our forever fate.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. as the actor was getting food from a Subway sandwich location after arriving to Chicago from New York. The actor reportedly suffered a fractured rib and was transported to Northwestern Memorial for treatment before being released Tuesday morning. The assault follows the arrival of a threatening letter reportedly sent to Fox's Chicago studios last week which was addressed to Smollett and contained a threat to his life along with similar hateful slurs. Entertainment Tonight reports that as a result of the attack, Smollett and the rest of the Empire cast will have armed security as the production of the show continues.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the Chicago Police Department revealed that it is investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.

As Empire actor Jussie Smollett recovers from an apparent homophobic and racially charged attack, the Fox show’s creator, Lee Daniels, is speaking out about the incident.

In a video posted to Instagram on Tuesday afternoon, the 59-year-old director began, “It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because, Jussie, you are my son.”

“You didn’t deserve — nor does anybody deserve — to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called, ‘Die, f—t n—r’ or whatever they said to you,” a visibly emotional Daniels continued.

Warning: This video contains NSFW language.

“You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that,” he added. “It starts at home … We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows that we are … [a] united front and no racist f—k can come in and do the things they did to you.”

Serayah McNeila (who plays singer Tiana Brown on Empire, also addressed the incident on social media.

“Your light will continue to shine bright, which is the part these disgusting people fail to realize,” the actress, 23, captioned a photo of herself and Smollett on Instagram. “I hope you make a speedy recovery and continue to educate, motivate, and inspire millions. Love you big bro.”

She signed the post with her nickname, Ray, a heart emoji, and the hashtags #stopthehate and #prayingpraying.

Other stars like John Legend, George Takei, Zendaya and Shonda Rhimes have also shown their support.

On Tuesday, TMZ reported that the actor was the victim of an apparent hate crime. The Chicago Police Department later confirmed in a statement to PEOPLE that a member of the hit Fox show was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery,” though they did not name Smollett.

The statement continued: “A 36 year old man was walking … when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him. The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

The victim was transported to Northwestern Hospital and is in “good condition.”

A Chicago P.D. spokesperson told PEOPLE that no arrests have been made and there are no solid suspects at this time. The officer said the attackers were wearing masks but would not confirm what they said, only that it was racially charged and homophobic. The victim thinks the liquid thrown on him was bleach, but detectives have yet to confirm that. He was by himself at the time of the attack.

TMZ reports that his attackers allegedly yelled, “This is MAGA country.” PEOPLE has not been able to independently confirm this.

Smollett’s reps did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement on the incident: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face or any despicable act of violence and hatred — and especially against one of our own.”

Smollett first spoke publicly about being gay on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2015, though he said he never considered himself to be in the closet.

“There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he said, adding that deciding not to talk about his personal life is not an attempt to “hide or deny who God made me. There is, without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in,” he reiterated, “and I just wanted to make that clear.”

In a statement about the attack to The Hollywood Reporter, GLAAD said it reached out to Fox and Smollett’s team to offer assistance."

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him."" Per the police, the two men beat Smollett, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him (bleach, according to TMZ) and ""wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

The men, both of whom wore ski masks to cover their faces, allegedly shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Police have not confirmed those specific details and a Chicago Police spokesperson told The Daily Beast there was ""no report"" of MAGA taunts from the attackers.

Representatives for the Chicago police department did not respond to requests for comment.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. as the actor was getting food from a Subway sandwich location after arriving to Chicago from New York. The actor reportedly suffered a fractured rib and was transported to Northwestern Memorial for treatment before being released Tuesday morning. The assault follows the arrival of a threatening letter reportedly sent to Fox's Chicago studios last week which was addressed to Smollett and contained a threat to his life along with similar hateful slurs. Entertainment Tonight reports that as a result of the attack, Smollett and the rest of the Empire cast will have armed security as the production of the show continues.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the Chicago Police Department revealed that it is investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.

In addition to Daniels, fellow Empire co-creator and executive producer Danny Strong reacted to the news on Twitter, writing that he was ""deeply horrified and saddened"" by the attack and calling Smollett's assailants ""hate-filled cowards.""

I'm deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett. He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live...

...whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment, the studio behind Empire, reacted to the attack with the following statement, shared with TV Guide: ""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stand united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate -- and especially against one of our own.""

In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) said that they have reached out to Fox to and the actor's reps to offer the organization's support, adding, ""Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.""

For good reason, Democrats have called Black women the backbone of the party and have relied on them before to help save the party. With the selection of Abrams to stand on the national stage in opposition to Trump, Democrats have returned to the well in the hopes of boosting their standing.

“She is just a great spokesperson. She’s an incredible leader. She has led the charge for voting rights, which is at the root of just about everything else. … I’m very excited that she’s agreed to be the respondent to the president,” Schumer told reporters, according to the Washington Post.

At a moment when our nation needs to hear from leaders who can unite for a common purpose, I am honored to be delivering the Democratic State of the Union response. https://t.co/0dpA3lJZpS — Stacey Abrams (@staceyabrams) January 29, 2019

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez has sung the praises of Black women as an important voting bloc in the party.

“Let me be clear: We won in Alabama and Virginia because Black women led us to victory. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and we can’t take that for granted. Period,” he told The Post in 2017 after big election wins in those two states.

Indeed, Democratic leaders viewed African-American women voters as a major part of their strategy to succeed in the 2018 midterm elections in battlegrounds states with large nonwhite populations, Perez added.

Abrams, who had a historic run for Georgia governor as the nation’s first Black woman nominee of a major party, was among the wave of Black women candidates in 2018 who displayed their ability to compete effectively for office despite the obstacles. That class included Massachusetts’ Rep. Ayanna Pressley and fellow freshman congresswoman Jahana Hayes of Connecticut.

Although Abrams fell short of winning the governorship–in a contest that was plagued with voter suppression targeting African-Americans–she has emerged as a rising star in the party.

Schumer and other top party leaders have reportedly tried to recruit Abrams to run for a U.S. Senate seat in 2020. Her name has also come up as a possible party nominee for president in 2020.

“I’m interested in everything,”Abrams told the newspaper in a Jan. 20 interview. “What I am trying to do is decide what’s the right job, am I the right person and is this the right time.”

Abrams will deliver her response to Trump in a prime time speech next Tuesday night, Feb. 5.

Other than the one visible laceration, Smollett appeared to be in good shape, and even gave his boss a slight smirk during their Facetime conversation.

As we reported, Daniels was outraged over the attack on Smollett, and told the 35-year-old actor he didn't deserve the violent treatment, which allegedly included a noose placed around Smollett's neck.

Chicago PD are still investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, but so far no suspects have been named.

Human Rights Campaign (HRC) President Chad Griffin issued the following statement on behalf of the organization:

I am sick to my stomach over the news of a violent attack on @JussieSmollett. I'm so glad you are safe, my friend. All of us at @HRC wish you a quick recovery.

On their website, the Anti-Defamation League posted the following statement:

""ADL today forcefully condemned the alleged homophobic and racist assault on actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago. 'This reported attack on Jussie is a disturbing reminder of the terrible homophobia and racism that plagues our society,' said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt. 'We call on police to investigate this vile incident as a hate crime and work swiftly to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice.' According to the FBI's 2017 Hate Crime Statistics Act (HCSA) report, 1,338 victims were targeted for their sexual-orientation and 2,458 victims were targeted for being African American. 'We stand with Jussie and our partners in the LGBTQ and African-American communities in fighting against this kind of hateful violence, which has no place in our society,' Greenblatt said. 'For decades, ADL has been the national leader in crafting and advocating for inclusive state and federal hate crime laws, including protections for the LGBTQ community, and we continue to be committed to this every day.'

HRC has reached out to Jussie Smollett as well as his colleagues at FOX to offer support, and is in touch with the FBI and Chicago Police Department to ensure the incident is fully and thoroughly investigated and that they will hold the perpetrators accountable .

“This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident,” HRC President Chad Griffin said. “There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities -- and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities.”

Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released hate crime statistics for 2017 revealing a disturbing increase of 17 percent in reported hate crimes from the previous year. In 2017, 7,175 hate crime incidents were reported, 1,130 of which were based on sexual orientation bias and 119 on gender identity bias. These numbers reflect a five percent increase in reporting of hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation bias, and a four percent decrease in reporting of hate crimes motivated by gender identity bias.

“Last year alone, at least 26 transgender people, mostly transgender women of color, were brutally murdered,” Griffin continued. “This is an unacceptable crisis, and HRC continues to press for improved reporting, passage of state laws that protect LGBTQ individuals from hate crimes, and expanded education and training initiatives.”

Smollett joined HRC’s Equality Rocks campaign last year, a series sparking conversations about love, fairness and equality around the globe. In April 2018, Smollett introduced Queer Eye host Karamo Brown, presenting him with the HRC Visibility Award at the Houston Gala.

Smollett came out as gay in 2015 on Ellen, noting that among the reasons he publicly came out was so “people understood that they’re not alone.”"

According to Variety, the lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court on Thursday (April 11) says that more than $130,000 in overtime costs were incurred as a result of the police investigation.

The suit alleges: ""On January 29, 2019, Defendant submitted a false police report claiming that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic beating by unknown attackers. In reality, Defendant knew his attackers and orchestrated the purported attack himself.

""Later, when police confronted him with evidence about his attackers, he still refused to disclose his involvement in planning the attack. In investigating Defendant’s false statements and false police report, the City incurred significant costs in order to provide services reasonably related to Defendant’s conduct.""

Last month, all charges against Smollett were dropped and he continues to maintain his innocence.

The City of Chicago's lawsuit follows his refusal to respond to the city's demand to pay the police overtime costs.

UPDATE (26/3/19): All charges against Empire star Jussie Smollett have been dropped, the actor's lawyers have confirmed.

Earlier this month, Smollett had been indicted on 16 counts in connection to his claims of being attacked in January, with the actor pleading not guilty to all counts (via BBC News).

Smollett's legal team confirmed in a statement to Variety today (March 26) that all the criminal charges against their client have now been dropped.

""Today, all criminal charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped and his record has been wiped clean of the filing of this tragic complaint against him,"" the statement read.

""Jussie was attacked by two people he was unable to identify on January 29th. He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks made to the public causing an inappropriate rush to judgement. Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions.

""This entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion. That is wrong. It is a reminder that a victim, in this case Jussie, deserves dignity and respect. Dismissal of charges against the victim in this case was the only just result.

""Jussie is relieved to have this situation behind him and is very much looking forward to getting back to focusing on his family, friends and career.""

In a statement regarding the new development, the Cook County Attorney's Office said that they had reviewed ""all of the facts and circumstances of the case"" – including Smollett's volunteer work and his agreement to forfeit his $10,000 bond – and added that ""this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case"".

UPDATE (8/3/19): Empire star Jussie Smollett has been indicted on 16 felony counts in Chicago in connection to his claims of being attacked in January.

Smollett was indicted by a grand jury on Friday (March 8) after previously being charged last month with felony disorderly conduct (via NBC News). He is alleged to have filed a false police report about the alleged January 29 attack.

The actor and his attorneys have maintained his innocence, and he personally denied staging the attack.

He previously posted $100,000 bail after being arrested and attending a bond hearing on Thursday, February 21.

Smollett has been suspended from his job on Empire for the rest of the season, pending the results of his criminal investigation. There has since been talk that his role of Jamal Lyon could be recast.

UPDATE (22/2/19): Empire star Jussie Smollett has been released from jail after posting bond, which a judge set at $100,000 during a bail hearing on Thursday (February 21).

On Wednesday, the actor was charged with a felony for filing a false police report and later turned himself in.

According to reports, Smollett returned to the set of Empire following the hearing, while his lawyers have said that they intend to mount a strong defence.

""Like any other citizen, Mr Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a statement.

UPDATE (20/2/19): Empire star Jussie Smollett has been charged with a felony for filing a false police report.

Earlier on Wednesday, Smollett's bosses at Fox stood behind him and insisted he would not be written out of his role in Empire.

""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a joint statement.

UPDATE (17/2/19): Empire star Jussie Smollett has said he is ""angered and devastated"" over recent developments in the investigation into an attack on him as he denies that he was involved in organising the attack in a statement through his lawyers.

The statement reads (via Variety): ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

The statement continues to say that Jussie and his lawyers anticipate being ""further updated"" by the Chicago PD and will ""continue to cooperate"" in the investigation.

Smollett's response comes after the Chicago PD confirmed in a statement to EW that information learned from two people who were previously arrested and released without charge in relation to the attack has ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"".

""We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,"" the statement added.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime,"" Chicago PD PIO News Affairs official Sally Born told Deadline.

Earlier this week, Smollett condemned those who doubted that he was telling the truth about his attack during his first TV interview with Good Morning America.

""I'm pissed off. It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks,"" Jussie says while tearing up in the preview clip. ""Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It's the truth.

""Then it became a thing of, like, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth. You don't even want to see the truth.""

In a joint statement today, Smollett's family said: ""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.

""Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.""

Rachel Luna Getty Images

Their statement went on: ""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.

""They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.""

No arrests have been made in the case, and Chicago police said they have no plans yet to hold any other press briefings.

He went on: ""I heard he's getting [better]. You know, he's angry but I know Jussie. Jussie's anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won't, and we cannot, forget their actions.

""They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.""

Smollett's on-screen mother Taraji P. Henson wrote on Instagram that she wished ""what happened to [her] baby was just one big bad joke"", but that the world world was feeling ""his pain"".

Original: Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been hospitalised after a suspected racial and homophobic attack.

Jussie – who plays Jamal Lyon, the son of Cookie and Lucious Lyon on the drama series, and who spoke publicly about his sexuality in 2015 – was attacked early this morning (January 29), with Chicago police confirming to The Hollywood Reporter that the attack is being called a possible hate crime.

According to the Chicago Police Department's incident details, a 36-year-old man was walking when two unknown offenders approached him and shouted out racial and homophobic slurs (via ET Online).

Police say the offenders allegedly began to attack the victim about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance onto the victim, before fleeing the scene. The victim was later taken to hospital, where he is said to be in good condition.

The statement continued: ""The victim is fully cooperating with investigators and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com.""

The 36-year-old actor told police he was assaulted by two men hurling racial and homophobic slurs.

Smollett told police he had just flown in from New York and was on his way to find food around 2 a.m. on East North Lower Water Street when the two men attacked him.

After the offenders fled the scene, Smollett took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment. The extent of his injuries is unknown.

Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, a gay singer-songwriter on the Fox series. The beloved actor came out as gay himself during an interview with Out magazine in 2016.

After details of the horrific hate crime were reported Tuesday, celebrities took to social media to send Smollett their heartfelt words of support.

According to Chicago police, Smollett was stopped around 2 a.m. on Tuesday by two men wearing ski masks who began yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

It was learned the attackers of the Empire star placed a noose around his neck after which they began to punch him and then pour an unknown substance on him.

“This is MAGA country,” the men then yelled, according to a report by TMZ.

Reacting, the Chicago police told ProPublica’s Ken Shwencke via email that if this statement was yelled it “was not reported to the police.”

A report by The Advocate says Jamal was able to self-transport himself to an area hospital where he is now in good condition and cooperating with Chicago detectives.

The attack is being investigated as a possible hate crime; Naija News quotes The Advocate to have reported.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” a police spokesperson said.

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him."" Per the police, the two men beat Smollett, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him (bleach, according to TMZ) and ""wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

The men, both of whom wore ski masks to cover their faces, allegedly shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Police have not confirmed those specific details and a Chicago Police spokesperson told The Daily Beast there was ""no report"" of MAGA taunts from the attackers.

Representatives for the Chicago police department did not respond to requests for comment.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. as the actor was getting food from a Subway sandwich location after arriving to Chicago from New York. The actor reportedly suffered a fractured rib and was transported to Northwestern Memorial for treatment before being released Tuesday morning. The assault follows the arrival of a threatening letter reportedly sent to Fox's Chicago studios last week which was addressed to Smollett and contained a threat to his life along with similar hateful slurs. Entertainment Tonight reports that as a result of the attack, Smollett and the rest of the Empire cast will have armed security as the production of the show continues.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the Chicago Police Department revealed that it is investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.

The 35-year-old actor was attacked on Tuesday in Chicago by two men who put a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him.

Police said the incident was “possibly racially charged” and the men shouted “racial and homophobic slurs”.

Smollett was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Police said Smollett was in “good condition”.

A police statement said the Chicago Police Department received a report of a “possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire. Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”

Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, the gay son of a music mogul, in the popular Fox drama.

The statement continued: “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

The King Centre for Nonviolent Social Change, which promotes racial equality in the US and was founded by Martin Luther King Jr’s wife, said it was praying for Smollett.

A tweet from the nongovernmental organisation said: “The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever rising tides of hate.

“We must turn this tide and ensure that no human beings, including our LGBTQ neighbours, are dehumanised and fettered by hate and violence. Praying for Jussie Smollett.” – PA"

Actor Jussie Smollett who is best known for his role as Jamal Lyon in the US drama Empire, has been taken to hospital after suffering a brutal attack outside a Chicago restaurant.

He was reportedly attacked by two men around 2am on Monday night.

According to The Chicago Tribune, the 35-year-old stepped out from a Subway restaurant shortly before being approached by his attackers, allegedly shouting racial and homophobic comments.

The duo then reportedly began battering the Santa Rosa-born lad, before pouring bleach over him.

Taking a turn for the worse, the men then allegedly proceeded to wrap a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene.

After the attack, Jussie went to hospital and was discharged earlier today.

In a statement, the Chicago Police Department told the publication: “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”

Despite the police looking into the incident, it is not clear whether Smollett was specifically targeted by the men and it is not yet confirmed if it stemmed from racist or homophobic motivations.

Although according to TMZ, it is reported that the actor this week has also been targeted by hate mail sent to Fox Studios, some containing death threats.

Empire’s co-creator Danny Strong sent his support on Twitter, writing: “I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attack against Jussie Smollett.

“He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart.”

Continuing his heartfelt message, he said: “The terror of racism and homophobia has no place inner society, it is the most indecent way to live.

“Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

GLAAD, an American organisation that has become an acronym for Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation [remove quotes marks], has spoken out about the incident.

Releasing a statement they reached out to Fox offering any assistance, branding Smollett ""a true champion for LGBTQ people [who] is beloved by the community and allies around the world"".

Proudly talking to Ellen DeGeneres back in 2015 about being openly gay, he declared: “There is no closet, there’s never been a closet that I’ve been in.”

Here Is The Full Story.,[],https://www.dailywire.com/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/uploads/2019/01/gettyimages-956699758.jpg?itok=fmDsy6FT,"['offenders', 'claim', 'jussie', 'chicago', 'actor', 'maga', 'smollett', 'politicize', 'attacked', 'fans', 'homophobic', 'victim', 'media', 'outlets']","CORRECTION: An initial title of this article suggested that the actor himself politicized the nature of his attackers. Rather, the only ones confirmed to politicize the nature of his attackers are sources close to the actor.

On Tuesday morning, black, openly gay actor Jussie Smollett — best known for his work on the Fox show “Empire” — was horrifically assaulted in Chicago by two men carrying a noose and a possible “chemical substance.” The Boston Globe reports:

Smollett, 35, was walking on the 300th block of E. North Lower Water Street around 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday, “when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department said in a statement to The Washington Post. ‘”The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.” The police could not confirm the gender of the offenders nor identify the chemical substance.

Following the terrible attack, Smollett is now recovering and is in “good condition” at Northwestern Hospital.

The Daily Mail reports that the Chicago Police Department is investigating the case as possibly being racially charged or homophobic in nature. The crime is also being investigated as possibly being premeditated, as Smollett had received a letter, dated January 18, stating, “You will die black f*g.”

Some media outlets reporting on the assault, however, have tried to also politicize the attack and indirectly place the blame on some of President Trump’s supporters. TMZ has run with the headline, “JUSSIE SMOLLETT VICTIM OF HOMOPHOBIC ATTACK BY MAGA SUPPORTERS.” In the article, TMZ claims:

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett was brutally attacked by 2 men who beat him up, put his head in a noose and screamed, “This is MAGA country.” Sources directly connected to Jussie tell TMZ, the actor arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday, and at around 2 AM he was hungry and went to a Subway. We’re told when shortly after he walked out on his way home, someone yelled, “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****?” The 2 men – both white and wearing ski masks — viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

But in their rush to politicize an indubitably horrific assault and thereby inflict blame upon some of President Trump’s supporters, some media outlets have gone well out over their skis. As Robby Soave of Reason notes, the Chicago Police Department has expressly disclaimed having any information about the assaulters’ race or political views:

Several media outlets referenced claims that appeared in TMZ’s coverage of this matter, most notably that the perpetrators were white and yelled “this is MAGA country,” as they attacked Smollett. But a spokesperson for the Chicago police denied having any information about the race and political views of the attackers. “According to the victim, the offenders’ faces were concealed,” a police spokesperson told Reason. “We have no record indicating that [they shouted ‘MAGA’], we only have record of them shouting racial and homophobic slurs at him.” Chicago police have also released a statement contradicting claims that Smollett identified his attackers’ race and heard them shout “MAGA.” “We have no record of The MAGA Country comment,” said the police in a statement. “We have racial and homophobic comments documented.”

It seems that, in their rush to politicize a terrible tragedy, some media outlets have “reported” much more than the present on-the-ground fact situation would otherwise support.

OPINION: The vicious homophobic and racist attack on Jussie Smollett shows the terrifying danger of MAGA thinking

Police say Smollett, 36, told them that early Tuesday, he was walking out of a Subway sandwich shop around 2 a.m., when someone yelled: “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n*****?” Then two white men wearing ski masks reportedly screamed “This is MAGA country!” At some point during the racially charged assault a noose was allegedly wrapped around Smollett’s neck, and he was beaten so brutally that a rib was fractured, according to reports.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police said in a statement released Tuesday.

Meanwhile transgender rights activist and editor-in-chief of Out magazine Raquel Willis was among the first to condemn the attack.

Meanwhile, entertainment news site That Grape Juice is also reporting that Fox Studios received hate mail earlier this month targeted at the 36-year-old actor. Haphazardly cut out letters from magazines were used to spell out “You will die black f**.”

But his supporters are vocal about their backing of him and are calling for justice.

New York Times best selling author and blogger Luvvie Ajayi echoed that.

The actor is beloved in the Black community so it comes as no surprise that everyone from Kerry Washington and John Legend to activists and politicians like Deray Mckesson and Andrew Gillum have sent love his way.

""The offenders began to 'batter' the man with their hands and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, according to police.""

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline,"" a CPD spokesman said in a statement.

""Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,"" the organization GLAAD said in a statement.

On the Fox show ""Empire,"" which premiered in 2015 and films in Chicago, Smollett's character, musician Jamal Lyon, is gay. And the actor confirmed his own queerness to Ellen DeGeneres in 2015 after an appearance on her show. ""There's never been a closet that I've been in,"" Smollett said, adding that he simply prefers to not talk about his personal life.""But it is in no way to hide or deny who God made me. You know?"" he continued. ""My mama knows. My mama likes me a lot.""

The horrific attack against Smollett adds to a particularly vicious month of discrimination, violence and neglect against the LGBTQ community. Last week, the Supreme Court voted in a 5-4 decision to allow President Trump's transgender military ban to go into effect. While the policy is still on hold for now, pending an injunction, many lamented the cruelty of the action against LGBT people and what it means for the future of this country.

""This is a survival issue,"" Chase Strangio, attorney at the ACLU, told Democracy Now! ""This is a question about whether the largest employer in our country can tell transgender people that they are not welcome, that they cannot actively be who they are and retain their employment. So we should be incredibly concerned not only about what this means for trans people, for our employment, for our healthcare, for our survival, in absolutely every context, but also whether or not we’re going to accept a government policy that’s premised on the idea that we don’t exist, and that if we do exist, we should not be protected in any way.""

That same week, The Atlantic published a bombshell exposé detailing decades of sexual abuse allegations against ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" director Bryan Singer. A key theme throughout the decades of alleged abuse is the accusers were gay boys and young men unprotected by wealth or family, making them especially vulnerable to seduction, manipulation and abuse. Cesar Sanchez-Guzman, who has accused Singer of rape, claims the director said to him after the alleged attack, ""Nobody is going to believe you."" (Singer denies all allegations of sexual misconduct.)

Earlier this month, Timothy Dean was found dead inside prominent Democratic donor Ed Buck's apartment in Los Angeles, marking the second gay black man to be found dead there in the span of 18 months. Buck has not been arrested or charged with any crime, though Dean's death is still under investigation. LaTisha Nixon, mother of the first alleged victim, Gemmel Moore, believes Buck should be held responsible. ""He will not stop,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""He will continue to hurt and kill black men. There are 2 people now that have lost their lives.""

Days later, Vice President Mike Pence's wife Karen Pence returned to the classroom to teach art at a private Christian elementary school that bans LGBTQ student and parents and refuses admission to anyone who supports sexual/gender equality. Potential employees also must sign a pledge affirming that marriage can only be between a man and woman and acknowledge that ""homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity"" is in violation of the school's moral code.

These events and revelations also magnify and bring into context the controversy around Kevin Hart's previous homophobic tweets and jokes, which the actor and comedian has repeatedly dismissed as old news during the controversy that ensued when he was announced as Academy Awards telecast host. He chose to give up the Oscars hosting gig rather than apologize in a meaningful way and address the real harm at the core of his jokes, which described wanting to use anger or force to prevent his son from being gay. ""I'm going to ignore it because it's 10 years old,"" Hart told DeGeneres after he stepped down from the job. ""I've apologized for it. I'm not going to pay it any mind, because when you feed into that stuff, you only add more fuel to the fire.""

The violence against Smollett, against transgender people, against queer youth and their families, makes patently clear that jokes at the expense of the LGBTQ community are not only never funny, but dangerous, as they contribute to a general climate of intimidation and derision which can enable, encourage, or overlook violent crimes. Journalist and activist George M. Johnson wrote on Twitter Tuesday: ""Little homophobia becomes big homophobia. Those jokes become thoughts Those thoughts become actions Those actions become death. Any homophobia or defense of it is a threat to the existence of LGBTQ folk."" It is a simple, yet urgent point that Hart and others who defended him refused to grasp.

But this specific attack against Smollett also illuminates the connectedness of racism and homophobia under the guise of white supremacy, and the intersections of violence felt specifically by queer people of color. A fight against white supremacist violence — whether that takes the form of the policies of the current administration or cold-blooded hate crimes against marginalized people — is recklessly incomplete without the inclusion of homophobia and transphobia and a vision to eradicate both.

While hate and violence against anyone who is not white, cisgender, heterosexual, Christian, American-born and male have been wide-reaching and enduring in the U.S., they gain strength from the unrelenting xenophobic fear-mongering by the powerful. And yet — even worse — this climate is allowed to flourish without consequence when an administration and constituency holds up each individual or potential act of violence from an immigrant, or a Muslim, or a black person, as justification for more hate in policy and ideology, but ignores the ever-growing violence of right-wing extremism in this country and abroad. White supremacy was at the center of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, too many mass shootings to list off, and now, according to the police, in the attack against Smollett Tuesday. When will we as a nation say enough?"

The Empire actor was allegedly beaten by two people who yelled racist and homophobic slurs while pouring an unknown substance on Smollett, CNN reported. The attackers allegedly put a noose around his neck before fleeting the scene, and Smollett brought himself to a nearby hospital.

A report from TMZ claimed that the men also made reference to Donald Trump, shouting a reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan as they put the noose around his neck.

The report has led to a sharp backlash against Trump, who has been blamed for increasing tension through a series of statements and actions seen by critics as racist. This includes sharing a fake “black crime” graphic during the 2016 campaign, per the Inquisitr, that used fabricated statistics to make it look as if blacks were responsible for nearly all violent crime against white people. The graphic itself was traced back to an openly neo-Nazi blogger. Trump also initially refused to repudiate the white supremacists responsible for violence at the 2017 protests in Charlottesville.

Others took aim at actions Donald Trump had taken to roll back the rights of LGBTQ people, including a ban on transgender persons serving in the U.S. military.

In the wake of the attack on Jussie Smollett, many took to Twitter to push blame on Donald Trump’s policies and rhetoric for fostering an atmosphere where the attack could take place. Some noted a rise in violence among the far-right, including a man accused of mailing bombs to political and media figures who had been frequent targets of criticism from Trump.

Others said that the attack was reflective of the rise in crimes both against minorities and LGBTQ individuals during Trump’s presidency.

There was some dispute about whether the attackers expressed support for Donald Trump during the beating. While the TMZ report claimed that the two attackers made reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan during the beating, the Daily Beast cited sources within the Chicago Police Department that claimed they had no report of those words being said.

He was beaten, called racist and homophobic slurs, doused with bleach, and a noose was wrapped around his neck.

During the assault, the monsters said to him: ""This is MAGA country."" Unspeakable.

Jussie was hospitalized for multiple injuries, including a cracked rib from the beating.

It turns out that just over a week ago, his life was threatened in a hateful letter that may be linked to the crime itself.

Police are investigating it as a ""possible"" hate crime (that's legal jargon for definitely a hate crime).

In the mean time, celebrities are in the same place as the rest of us: shocked, angry, and wondering what they can do.

They have taken to social media to voice their support for him and openly wonder at the evil in some people's hearts."

The Empire star was hospitalized after the altercation, where two men in ski masks allegedly put a noose around his neck and hit him repeatedly after yelling homophobic and racial slurs at him.

""Jussie tried to protect himself and at one point the men poured a substance on him believed to be bleach and one of the guys put a rope around his neck,"" a source told Entertainment Tonight of the incident. ""After some time the men fled the scene and Jussie went to the hospital.""

""Jussie is mostly physically O.K. with some scrapes and bruises, but he's more emotionally shook up,"" they added.

The report by the outlet reveals that Chicago Police visited a nearby Subway restaurant searching for surveillance footage of the attack. The restaurant is located about four to five minutes away from the Loews Hotel where Smollett was reportedly staying.

The actor transported himself to Northwestern Hospital after the attack and has been released. The Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told press in a statement that the investigation on the attack is currently underway and is being treated as a ""possible hate crime.""

Smollett has not spoken publicly on the attack so far, though many celebrities have sent him messages of support on social media.

Grey's Anatomy star Ellen Pompeo posted a long supportive message to Smollet on her Instagram, sending him her love and support.

""Sending [Jussie Smollett] all of my love and support today and every day. No one can dim your light,"" she wrote, along with a photo of the actor and singer. ""To all of my fans I beg of you... speak up..be courageous ..if you hear hateful language ...racist language ..homophobic language ...please be the warriors I need you to be.""

She ended her post writing: ""What kind of person do you want to be? Someone who has something to say and fights for the human race who believes in their personal power?

Police did not release the actor’s name but a statement from Fox, which airs “Empire,” identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime. Smollett is black and openly gay.

According to a police statement, the actor was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. today when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an “unknown substance” on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that when officers first came in contact with Smollett, he still had a rope around his neck. While being interviewed by detectives, Guglielmi said Smollett told them that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The police spokesman added that the two men were wearing masks. Investigators have not found any surveillance video or witnesses from which they can put together a description of the offenders, he said.

Smollett was able to take himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was last reported in good condition.

Guglielmi also said the FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago last week.

The hourlong drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Jamal Lyon, Smollett’s character, is the gay, middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement today in support of Smollett. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence,” the statement read.

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels also voiced his support for Smollett in an Instagram video.

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” Daniels said. “You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.”

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

“He is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I’ve ever met,” Harris said today, adding that she’s still learning more details about the incident.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues and he released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

“Empire” is shot in Chicago and a Fox spokeswoman said the program is currently in production."

UPDATE: Gwyneth Paltrow denied Wednesday that she skiied into a man who accused her in a lawsuit of seriously injuring him at a Utah ski resort.

In a counterclaim, Paltrow says that the man, Dr. Terry Sanderson, actually plowed into her from behind and hit her with a full “body blow.”

The A-list actor said she was shaken by the collision and quit skiing with her family for the day. She said Sanderson apologized to her and said he was fine. She had previously denied blame for the crash in a statement but had not yet offered a full version of the events.

“She did not knock him down,” Paltrow’s court filing said. “He knocked her down. He was not knocked out.”

You can read Paltrow’s counterclaim in its entirety, below. (The original story can be found below the counterclaim.)

ORIGINAL STORY: A Utah doctor has filed a lawsuit against actor Gwyneth Paltrow, claiming the star collided with him on a ski hill and then left him with serious injuries. He’s seeking US$3.1 million in damages.

In legal papers filed Tuesday, Dr. Terry Sanderson said that Paltrow severely injured him in a “hit-and-run” ski crash at Deer Valley Resort in Utah.

Waiting for a press conf. Calling it a “hit & run ski crash” #kutv2news pic.twitter.com/G14UaAb19f — Dan Rascon (@DanKUTV) January 29, 2019

Salt Lake City lawyer Robert B. Skyes, who’s representing Sanderson, said the doctor was struck from behind while skiing on a “green” run at the resort three years ago in February 2016. (Green generally indicates a beginner run.) The filed documents state that he suffered a traumatic brain injury, four broken ribs and other “serious injuries.”

The lawsuit also accuses Paltrow of being “distracted” while skiing and of causing immense emotional distress.

Skyes said the A-list actor skied off without checking on Sanderson and “accepted no responsibility.”

Heather Wilson, a spokeswoman for Paltrow, says the lawsuit is “without merit” and that Paltrow expects to be “vindicated.”

Paltrow’s ski instructor, Eric Christiansen, who was with her during the time of the alleged incident, claims that Sanderson caused the crash. The doctor contests this version of events, saying there’s no way the instructor witnessed it. There is another eyewitness, Craig Ramon, who often skied together with Sanderson and was present that day, and his testimony is in line with the doctor’s.

“I saw her hitting him perfectly in the back,” claimed Ramon in a video interview played during a Tuesday press conference. “She landed right on top of him, then she slides off to the side… Gwyneth started trying to get up. Terry wasn’t moving or anything. He didn’t lose his skis, they were facing directly out and he’s facing directly down the hill.”

The lawsuit, which was filed in the Third District Court of Summit County, claims Christiansen didn’t notify any emergency responders and supposedly filed a fake report to protect Paltrow.

“I hit some dead ends,” said Sanderson at the press conference when asked why it took so long to file the lawsuit. “I got worn out and tired of having to relive these circumstances. There were a few months there where I didn’t have my faculties and probably didn’t do the right thing and move forward [with this case].”

The lawsuit reads that Sanderson “suffered physical and mental injuries… pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, emotional distress and disfigurement,” including “anxiety, depression and other health problems.” He said he “incurred medical expenses and additional life care expenses” and he will “continue to suffer injuries and damages in the future due to the negligence” of Paltrow and Deer Valley resort.

Sanderson is also suing for punitive damages, legal costs and lawyer fees.

“I would like to be vindicated,” said Sanderson at the press conference. At multiple instances during the conference, the doctor held his head in his hands and at times appeared confused.

Sanderson claims his lawyer has been in touch with Paltrow’s legal team, but no further details of those talks were revealed.

Now, we’ve lost yet another young woman in a horrifying accident that could’ve probably been prevented.

Friends and family are mourning 22-year-old Malaysia Goodson, who died after she fell down a flight of MTA stairs Monday night. The mom was attempting to carry her daughter, who was seated in a stroller, down the stairs at the 53rd/7th Avenue station in Midtown Manhattan. According to the NY Times, she was unconscious and unresponsive when officials arrived to the scene. Goodson was then taken to Mount Sinai West hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to police. Her 1-year-old daughter Rhylee was in good condition and treated at the scene, and has now been reunited with her father and grandmother.

Goodson’s brother Shawn told the NY Times he wished he could have helped her, adding that she’d been in NYC for a shopping trip with her cousin. As for what exactly killed the young mom, the site reports “It was not clear whether Ms. Goodson suffered from a medical condition or if she was killed from the impact of the fall. The city’s medical examiner will determine her cause of death, officials said.”

Spokesperson for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Shams Tarek commented that “it is a heartbreaking tragedy,” informing the news outlet that the MTA would work with police to investigate Goodson’s death. The message is too little, too late as social media is disgusted with the fact that most of the subway stations in NYC are not fully accessible—and a person died because of it.

“Only a quarter of the subway system is accessible, keeping thousands of elderly and disabled NYers from the system and leading to horrible incidents like this. Riders deserve a specific time frame on the agency’s plans to achieve full accessibility,” borough president Gale A. Brewer tweeted.

“In addition to serving an essential purpose for people with disabilities, surveys show elevators are widely used by parents with strollers and older people who struggle with stairs. They’re not just nice-to-have, they’re essential. And yet…For years the MTA dragged its heels on station accessibility, resulting in the least accessible major subway system in the nation,” @TransitCenter commented.

“Twitter, I’ve nearly done this with Elijah. I’ve carried his stroller down New York subway steps, thinking to myself: ‘if I slip, I’ll fall backwards with the stroller on top of me & wrap my body around it so he’s okay.’ Maybe offer to help people carrying strollers,” another mom tweeted.

We are praying for the Goodson family at this time and may Malaysia rest in peace."

Chicago police on Tuesday said they were investigating an assault on Empire actor Jussie Smollett as a possible hate crime after two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs and wrapped a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was reported to be in good condition after taking himself to a hospital after the incident early Tuesday, police said.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police said in a statement.

Police did not identify Smollett by name, but gave his age and said he had a role on Empire. Representatives from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment confirmed he was the victim.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” Fox officials said in an emailed statement.

The two unknown assailants approached Smollett on the street at about 2 a.m. CST (3.00 a.m. ET) and began a “possible racially motivated” attack, yelling racial and homophobic slurs, police said.

The assailants hit him in the face, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives were gathering video of the area and looking for witnesses.

A representative for Smollett did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Empire, a hip-hop musical drama series, premiered on Fox Television in 2015 and has been nominated for Grammy and Golden Globe awards. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Smollett’s colleagues said they were shocked by the attack.

“The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,” Empire co-creator Danny Strong said on Twitter.

Raquel Willis, an African-American transgender rights activist and executive editor of Out magazine, a lifestyle publication that centres on the LGBT community, condemned the attack on Twitter.

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him."" Per the police, the two men beat Smollett, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him (bleach, according to TMZ) and ""wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

The men, both of whom wore ski masks to cover their faces, allegedly shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Police have not confirmed those specific details and a Chicago Police spokesperson told The Daily Beast there was ""no report"" of MAGA taunts from the attackers.

Representatives for the Chicago police department did not respond to requests for comment.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. as the actor was getting food from a Subway sandwich location after arriving to Chicago from New York. The actor reportedly suffered a fractured rib and was transported to Northwestern Memorial for treatment before being released Tuesday morning. The assault follows the arrival of a threatening letter reportedly sent to Fox's Chicago studios last week which was addressed to Smollett and contained a threat to his life along with similar hateful slurs. Entertainment Tonight reports that as a result of the attack, Smollett and the rest of the Empire cast will have armed security as the production of the show continues.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the Chicago Police Department revealed that it is investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him."" Per the police, the two men beat Smollett, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him (bleach, according to TMZ) and ""wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

The men, both of whom wore ski masks to cover their faces, allegedly shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Police have not confirmed those specific details and a Chicago Police spokesperson told The Daily Beast there was ""no report"" of MAGA taunts from the attackers.

Representatives for the Chicago police department did not respond to requests for comment.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. as the actor was getting food from a Subway sandwich location after arriving to Chicago from New York. The actor reportedly suffered a fractured rib and was transported to Northwestern Memorial for treatment before being released Tuesday morning. The assault follows the arrival of a threatening letter reportedly sent to Fox's Chicago studios last week which was addressed to Smollett and contained a threat to his life along with similar hateful slurs. Entertainment Tonight reports that as a result of the attack, Smollett and the rest of the Empire cast will have armed security as the production of the show continues.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the Chicago Police Department revealed that it is investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent? And at different moments...you're seeing the yin and yang of that, the positive and negative of both. Both are just trying to love this child."

The toy was not choking the dog, but officials said the dog was still very distraught.

Police wouldn’t release the actor’s name, but a statement from the Fox studio and network on which “Empire” airs identified him Tuesday as Jussie Smollett.

A statement from Chicago police says the man said he was walking downtown about 2 a.m. Tuesday when two men approached him shouting, then struck him in the face and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him before one wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police say he was hospitalized in good condition.

According to Smollet, who spoke to CNN's Don Lemon Tuesday, the two perpetrators, who were wearing ski masks, yelled, ""Aren't you that f****t 'Empire' n*****?"" before attacking him, placing a rope around his neck and pouring an unknown chemical substance on him.

They also yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" before walking away from the scene of the crime. MAGA is shorthand for US President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America great again.""

Smollett, who is openly gay, was discharged from Chicago's Northwestern Memorial hospital Tuesday morning. He transported himself to the hospital after being attacked.

Jussie Smollett was ‘brutally beaten’ in an alleged hate crime, with two men ‘putting a noose around his neck’ during the attack, in Chicago.

The Empire actor was reportedly set upon on in the early hours of this morning, as attackers ‘beat him up and poured bleach on him,’ before screaming: ‘This is MAGA country.’

Following the reports, Empire boss Lee Daniels shared an emotional video, urging the actor to ‘hold his head up’.

Taking to Instagram, he began: ‘It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because Jussie, you are my son.

‘You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called, “die f*****n*****,” or whatever they said to you.

‘You are better than that, we are better than that. America is better than that.’

Getting emotional, he continued: ‘It starts at home. It starts at home, yo we have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows we are united on a united front, and no racist fuck can come in and do the things they did to you.

‘Hold your head up, Jussie. I’m with you, I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another fucking day in America.’

Lee’s post comes after TMZ stated Empire staff held an emergency meeting to tell the cast and crew what had happened to Jussie, with several actors ‘extremely upset’.

An insider told the publication there was a discussion about strengthening security on set while the rest of the season is shot.

A spokesperson for Fox shared a statement, which read: ‘We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night.

‘We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

‘The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.’

TMZ states Jussie landed in Chicago late last night, and headed to Subway for food at around 2am, when he was approached by two men in ski masks.

The men in question asked him: ‘Aren’t you that f****t Empire n*****?’ before beating him, ‘putting a rope around his neck and pouring bleach on him’.

He attempted to fight them off but they overpowered him, reportedly screaming: ‘This is MAGA country,’ as they walked away.

The 35-year-old was later taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment, and was found to have fractured a rib.

The Chicago Police Department have confirmed they are looking into the incident.

Following the attack, a string of famous faces have reached out to Jussie – including several of his Empire co-stars.

Serayah, who plays Tiana on the show, posted: ‘I’m so saddened my heart hurts so bad for my love. Big bro @jussiesmollett I am praying for you. I hate the world we live in.’

Empire star Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago last night by two men wearing ski masks and red MAGA hats who yelled “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****?” They then beat him, fracturing a rib, put a rope around his neck, and poured bleach on him, all the while screaming, “This is MAGA country.”

According to TMZ: Jussie was able to get himself to Northwestern Memorial where he was treated. He was discharged later Tuesday morning.

It’s probably no coincidence that eight days ago, a letter was sent to Jussie at Fox Studios in Chicago with cut out letters spelling, “You will die black fa**ot”

Here are some TMZ updates:

11:10 AM PT — “Empire” creator Lee Daniels just expressed his outrage and horror over the attack. 11:18 AM PT — We’re told cops recently visited a Target Department Store close to where the incident happened and obtained surveillance footage. Our source says the video shows one person — presumably Jussie — walking down the street. Officers also visited a nearby apartment building to ask for video. 11:20 AM PT — Law enforcement sources tell us the FBI was already investigating the letter sent to Jussie last week containing racist and homophobic slurs. 11:10 AM PT — Fox just issued this statement … “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

We’re told the cast and crew were extremely upset. Several actors were already in their trailers getting ready to shoot when they got the news.

At around 2 a.m., police say that Smollett was approached by two people who proceeded to assault the actor after subjecting him to racist and homophobic slurs. His assailants are alleged to have battered his face before pouring what has been described as an unknown chemical substance on him. “At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck,” the police report reads.

Smollett — a black, gay, and Jewish actor who got his start in Hollywood as a child actor in movies such as The Mighty Ducks — is best known for his portrayal of Jamal Lyon on Empire, a breakthrough role in terms of the representation of queer people of color on television.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses, and establish an investigative timeline,” said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi in a statement.

TMZ reports that both attackers were white men wearing ski masks, that the chemical was bleach, and that the men yelled “This is MAGA country” at Smollett as they fled. CPD told ThinkProgress that the “MAGA country” claims were not reported to police so they “can’t confirm if they occurred.”

ABC 7 reporter Rob Elgas tweeted that Chicago police “did a follow-up, supplemental interview with…Smollett, where he did in fact tell police his attackers yelled ‘MAGA country.’” Elgas also reports that “when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed,” according to a Chicago Police Department spokesperson.

After the assault, Smollett got himself to Northwestern General Hospital, where he was treated and subsequently discharged. TMZ also pointed to a report by ThatGrapeJuice.Net, which described a letter that was addressed to Smollett and sent to Fox Studios in Chicago with ransom-note-style magazine cut-out letters spelling out “You will die black fag.” The letter was addressed to Smollett, had “MAGA” printed in red marker where the return address would be, and was reportedly sent to Fox eight days ago. The Federal Bureau of Investigation will be investigating the source of the letter, according to ABC News.

Fox representatives identified Smollett as the victim and released a statement Tuesday afternoon:

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Smollett has been on Empire since its premiere in 2015. In March 2017, Smollett released a music video for his song “F.U.W. (Fucked Up World)” to protest the “race-baiting, bigotry and xenophobia of the current administration,” as his press release put it. In the black and white video, which Smollett also directed, a mask of President Donald Trump’s face is crushed by a man in a wheelchair. In an interview with the Associated Press, Smollett described the mask as “a representation of this false idea of patriotism [and] this idea of white male privilege.”

“It’s so much bigger than [Trump],” Smollett said. “It’s what he represents, and it’s because of that representation, that’s why he’s the president of the United States currently.”

The apparent assault of Smollett coincides with a rise in hate crimes the nation over. Hate crimes surged in the first year of Trump’s presidency and increased 17 percent from 2016 to 2017, the third consecutive year in which that number grew. Nearly three in five of the more than 7,100 hate crimes committed in 2017 were motivated by racism. The F.B.I. found that black people accounted for nearly half of hate crime victims in 2017.

But reporting of hate crimes is voluntary, and so hate crimes remain significantly underreported. As the New York Times noted last year, only 12.6 percent of the agencies in the F.B.I. report indicated that hate crimes had occurred in their jurisdictions in 2017, and some massive agencies — Miami, Las Vegas — reported none at all. “Data shows that hate crime victims often do not trust that reporting will help them.”"

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett is recovering following an attack that authorities are reportedly investigating as a hate crime.

As reported by TMZ, Smollett, 35, had traveled from New York to Chicago and was exiting a Subway at 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two white men wearing ski masks—one of whom yelled, “Aren’t you that f**** ‘Empire’ n****r?” before attacking the openly gay, black actor.

Sources told the tabloid that the men attacked Smollett, poured bleach on him, and tied a noose around his neck before saying, “This is MAGA country.”

CNN, however, reports that police have not officially identified the liquid poured on the actor as bleach; they indicated the suspects “poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.”

The men reportedly fled the scene after the attack.

Smollett was hospitalized for a fractured rib and released early Tuesday. Chicago police released a statement that confirmed they’re treating the incident as a possible hate crime.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”

A letter exclusively obtained by That Grape Juice Studios was reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago, specifically addressed to Smollett, which read, “You will die black f*g,” from cut-and-paste magazine clippings.

The letter also appears to show a red stick figure being shot with a gun.

Sources told TMZ, “The actor arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday, and at around 2 AM he was hungry and went to a Subway. We’re told when shortly after he walked out on his way home, someone yelled, ‘Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n*****?'”

The men were both white and wearing ski masks, according to the sources, who say Smollett fought back but was beaten so badly he fractured a rib. “Jussie took himself to Northwestern Memorial where he was treated. He was discharged later Tuesday morning,” the site states.

It seems the attack was planned, as ThatGrapeJuice.net got its hands on a threatening letter addressed to Smollett.

“You will die black f*ck,” it reads. “The envelope the letter arrived in appears to say MAGA in the upper left corner. Chicago PD tells us they are investigating the attack as a possible hate crime, and they are canvasing the area for any video,” TMZ states. See photos of the letter here.

According to updates posted by TMZ, the Empire cast is extremely upset over what happened. Fox has also issued a statement that reads, “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

Sources close to Jussie told TMZ that he arrived in Chicago from New York on late Monday. At around 2 a.m., he reportedly got hungry and left his place to go to a Subway. This is when someone yelled at him, “Aren’t you that fa**ot ‘Empire’ ni**er,” according to the source.

The two men, who were both White and wearing ski masks, then proceeded to viciously attack Jussie as he tried to fight them off. Sources say they even put a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him and fled the scene as they yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

Jussie was taken to Northwestern Memorial hospital for treatment, and he was discharged on Tuesday morning.

An editor for HuffPost, Philip Lewis, tweeted out a statement released by the Chicago Police Department. “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline,” the statement read. “The victim is fully cooperating with investigators and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com.”

According to ThatGrapeJuice.Net, Jussie was sent a threatening letter before his attack on Monday reading, “You will die black f**.” TMZ sources say the letter was delivered eight days ago. The envelope in which the letter was sent also seemed to say MAGA in the upper left corner.

Smollett plays openly gay character Jamal Lyon on Empire, one of the few Black gay male characters on a hit T.V. show, especially when it premiered in 2015. Since the show’s success, Smollett has become more candid about his own sexuality. When he visited The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2015, he told Ellen that he never considered himself to be in the closet.

“There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he said. He added that his decision not to talk about his personal life was not an attempt to “hide or deny who God made me.” He continued “There is, without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in, and I just wanted to make that clear.”

In a 2016 interview with Out magazine, Jussie clarified, “If I had to label myself, I would label myself as a gay man. With that said, I believe that love is the only thing that matters, and I would hope that anybody would leave themselves open — not to gender, but to love.”

Since the vile turn of events on Monday, Jussie has received nothing but love from fans, celebrities and friends like Empire co-creator Lee Daniels. Hit the next pages to find out what people had to say.

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him."" Per the police, the two men beat Smollett, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him (bleach, according to TMZ) and ""wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

The men, both of whom wore ski masks to cover their faces, allegedly shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Police have not confirmed those specific details and a Chicago Police spokesperson told The Daily Beast there was ""no report"" of MAGA taunts from the attackers.

Representatives for the Chicago police department did not respond to requests for comment.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. as the actor was getting food from a Subway sandwich location after arriving to Chicago from New York. The actor reportedly suffered a fractured rib and was transported to Northwestern Memorial for treatment before being released Tuesday morning. The assault follows the arrival of a threatening letter reportedly sent to Fox's Chicago studios last week which was addressed to Smollett and contained a threat to his life along with similar hateful slurs. Entertainment Tonight reports that as a result of the attack, Smollett and the rest of the Empire cast will have armed security as the production of the show continues.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the Chicago Police Department revealed that it is investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.

The toy was not choking the dog, but officials said the dog was still very distraught.

Jussie Smollett at the 2017 BET Awards. (Danny Moloshok/Reuters) By Travis M. Andrews and Travis M. Andrews Pop culture reporter covering music, movies, TV, comedy and celebrity culture Email Bio Follow Bethonie Butler Bethonie Butler Reporter covering television and pop culture Email Bio Follow January 29 at 2:38 PM Jussie Smollett, a black, openly gay actor best known for his work in Fox’s “Empire,” was assaulted in Chicago by two people carrying a noose and an unidentified “chemical substance” in what police are calling a “possible racially charged assault and battery.”

Smollett, 35, was walking in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street about 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday “when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department said in a statement to The Washington Post. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.”

The police could not confirm the gender of the offenders or identify the chemical substance.

“At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victims neck,” the statement said.

Eventually the offenders fled, and Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Hospital “and is in good condition.”

TMZ reported that Smollett was discharged this morning. The hospital could not confirm this detail but told The Post that Smollett is not currently a patient.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said.

Fox released a statement Tuesday in support of the actor. “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Smollett’s publicist did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Smollett began his career as a child actor with his siblings, who include actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. He is best known for playing Jamal Lyon on “Empire.” The character is a gay R&B musician who has faced homophobic criticism from his mogul father.

The character struggled with his sexuality before coming out in a buzzed-about Season 1 episode. The plot development led to widespread speculation about Smollett’s sexuality. A month later, Smollett appeared on the TV show “Ellen,” when he confirmed he is gay.

“It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet, there’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he told TV host Ellen DeGeneres. “I don’t have a closet. But I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home. So that’s why I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is, without a doubt, no closet I’ve ever been in. And I just wanted to make that clear.”

He more directly addressed his sexuality in a 2016 interview with Out magazine. Though Smollett said he was open to falling in love with anyone, he identifies as a gay man.

“I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I don’t know how many times I have to say that,” he told the magazine.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” GLAAD said in a statement.

Last year, the FBI said there was a 17 percent increase in hate crimes in 2017 — the third consecutive year such crimes increased. Of the 7,175 hate crimes reported by United States law enforcement agencies, 2,013 incidents targeted black Americans. 1,130 hate crimes involved people who were targeted based on their sexual orientation.

Messages of support from fans and fellow celebrities for Smollett poured out on Twitter as the news unfolded Tuesday.

“Empire” co-star Vivica A. Fox tweeted in all caps: “IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!! SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE! PRAYERS UP TO U NEPHEW!”

Strong, meanwhile, wrote that he is “deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks.”

Smollett “is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,” Strong tweeted . “Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

The 35-year-old is said to have arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday before heading to a Subway takeout restaurant for food around 2 a.m., TMZ was first to report.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed the report of an attack against the actor, releasing a statement to ET saying two unknown offenders allegedly gained Smollett’s attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him.

They also said the offenders reportedly began to batter the victim with their hands on his face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

At some point during the incident, one of the offenders allegedly wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene. The star then took himself to Northwestern Hospital.

CPD chief spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement obtained by ET: “Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show ‘Empire’.”

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators.”

TMZ also reported the two men had screamed, “This is MAGA country” during the attack. Rob Elgas of ABC 7 Chicago confirmed some of the reported details after speaking with a Chicago PD spokesperson, as published in a series of tweets on Monday.

Additionally, in their initial report, Jussie Smollett did not tell police his attackers yelled “MAGA.” Chicago Police PIO added: “I’m not saying it’s not true. He could have remembered later, but he did not tell officers that in the initial report.” 2/2 — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 29, 2019

ThatGrapeJuice.Net published a threat letter by an unknown person, which had reportedly been sent to Fox Studios in Chicago eight days ago. It had cut-out letters spelling “You will die black f**k” on it.

Following news of the incident, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment (which produces “Empire”) issued a statement addressing the vicious attack.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our ‘Empire’ family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” reads the statement. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stand united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson has also released a statement: “The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling,” he states. “The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric. It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse. As this rhetoric continues to bleed into our everyday lives, dangerous behaviour will continue to place many law-abiding individuals at risk. We pray for a full physical and mental recovery Jussie Smollett and many unnamed victims of this form of hate based terrorism.”

In addition, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis issued a statement. “Our hearts are with Jussie Smollett as he recovers from a hate-motivated and repugnant attack in Chicago. Jussie has always used his voice and talent to create a better world, and it is disgusting that anyone, especially someone who has done such good for so many, would be targeted by undeniable hatred,” she said.

“GLAAD condemns these despicable acts as well as the racism and homophobia that drove them. Law enforcement needs to urgently conduct a thorough investigation and continue to be transparent with Chicago’s Black and LGBTQ communities who may be experiencing heightened fears of violence,” added Ellis.

“Jussie’s experience is sadly not unique in today’s America,” the statement concludes. “Countless LGBTQ and people of colour, as well as those who belong to both communities, are faced with hate-motivated violence on a near-daily basis. We stand with Black and racial justice leaders to combat hate violence in all of its forms.”

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him."" Per the police, the two men beat Smollett, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him (bleach, according to TMZ) and ""wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

The men, both of whom wore ski masks to cover their faces, allegedly shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Police have not confirmed those specific details and a Chicago Police spokesperson told The Daily Beast there was ""no report"" of MAGA taunts from the attackers.

Representatives for the Chicago police department did not respond to requests for comment.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. as the actor was getting food from a Subway sandwich location after arriving to Chicago from New York. The actor reportedly suffered a fractured rib and was transported to Northwestern Memorial for treatment before being released Tuesday morning. The assault follows the arrival of a threatening letter reportedly sent to Fox's Chicago studios last week which was addressed to Smollett and contained a threat to his life along with similar hateful slurs. Entertainment Tonight reports that as a result of the attack, Smollett and the rest of the Empire cast will have armed security as the production of the show continues.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the Chicago Police Department revealed that it is investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.

TMZ reports that Smollett, who is openly gay and plays Jamal Lyon, a gay character on Empire, was on the subway at around 2:00 AM when an unknown man yelled, ""Aren't you that f*ggot on Empire, n*gger?""

Two white men in ski masks then assaulted the 35-year-old, while yelling racial and homophobic slurs, as well as saying: ""This is MAGA country."" The assailants reportedly fractured Smollett's ribs, wrapped a noose of rope around his neck, and poured chemicals on him before fleeing the scene.

TMZ confirms that Smollett is now in good condition, and has been released from Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he was treated.

The attack is being investigated as a hate crime, according to USA Today. The Chicago Police Department released a statement today addressing ""a cast member of the television show Empire,"" regarding ""racially-charged assault and battery."" They are currently seeking video footage of the attack.

Pop culture website That Grape Juice claims to have proof that the attack was premeditated. They've shared a photo of a letter allegedly sent to Smollett at Fox Studios in Chicago eight days ago that reads in cut-out letters: ""You will die black fag.""

Smollett is vocal about queer issues, and has been out since 2015 when he spoke about his sexuality in an interview on Ellen.

""While details are still developing, the hate violence Jussie Smollett experienced is reflective of what we see in our national data on hate violence...."" the New York City Anti-Violence Project said in a statement. ""LGBTQ people living at multiple intersections of oppression, such as racism and homophobia, experience compounded violence. This reality is what informs us to do our work holistically. Jussie is not alone. Gay Black men are some of the most vulnerable to violence in the LGBTQ community and this must continue to be addressed. Our work focuses to end and disrupt systemic violence that thousands of LGBTQ survivors face, while also working to support survivors in the aftermath of violence. Our deepest thoughts and commitment to this work is with Jussie and all survivors. If you're experiencing anti-LGBTQ hate violence in the Chicago area, reach out to local NCAVP partner Center on Halsted Anti-Violence Project at (773) 472-6469, Ext. 474. For incidents across the nation, find your local NCAVP partner at avp.org/ncavp.""

Members of the Black and queer communities are sharing their support online, and emphasizing the need to address that Smollett's attack was an act of both racist and homophobic violence."

“I will say this. The crime that he reported is horrendous. It’s horrible. It was cowardly. We’ll do everything we can.” Johnson said.

He continued: ""We don't have anything that we've actually been able to view ... He's a victim right now, and we'll treat him like a victim. He's been very cooperative, and we have no reason, at this point, to think that he's not being genuine with us.”"

But the woman featured on this video has to rank among the bottom 10.

In footage that has been viewed by nearly three million people on Facebook, this unnamed passenger was on board a United Airline flight last week when she very openly and very loudly complained about the people sitting on each side of her.

The woman is in a middle seat and telling someone on the phone that the folks to her left and right are simply gross and overweight.

She's saying this very much in their presence, of course.

“Oh my goodness, I don’t know how I’m going to do this the next four hours. This is just impossible because they’re squishing me,” she says in the video, adding:

“At least they’ll keep me warm.""

After hanging up, the woman asks a flight attendant to find her a window seat and “get me out of here [because] I can’t do this.""

At this point, one of the people who was the victim of the fat-shaming speaks up and says to the same flight attendant:

“Excuse me, can you find her another seat? Because I will not be verbally abused by this bitch or anybody else.”

When the awful individual is finally told that, yes, she can change seats, she announce for all to hear:

“Thank goodness, because I eat salad, okay?""

Fortunately, many other passengers then spoke out in defense of the victims and against this despicable lady.

“You should be ashamed of yourself, what you’re doing is so terrible,"" one person says, to which she replies:

“I’m not going to be politically correct. Why don’t you sit between those two big pigs?”

Thankfully, this story has a positive ending: The abuser was eventually escorted off the plane.

“United flight attendants care about the safety and well being of all of our customers which is why they acted quickly to find a different seat for the disruptive customer,” a United spokesman said.

""When it became clear that this passenger’s behaviour was likely to be problematic on this flight, she was provided alternate travel arrangements first thing the next morning.""

Ariel Winter has responded to people on social media who criticized her recent weight loss on Instagram.

On Sunday, the 21-year-old actress posted a photo from a friend’s birthday party on social media.

In the photo, Winter wore a checkered jumpsuit, which showed off her slim physique.

The Modern Family star’s followers began body-shaming her for her noticeable weight loss.

“You were fine just the way you were before not now,” one user wrote.

Others added comments like “Where are the curves?!” and “Where your booty go?”

“She’s just conforming to Hollywood standards—how is anyone surprised?” another person wrote.

“I’m sorry you felt the need to so dramatically change your appearance. I liked you just as you were. I hope you are happy in your new body though,” another fan commented.

A different user wrote, “Nothing wrong with being honest and telling her we liked her better before ‘the change’ she was so beautiful before she started chopping up her body and if me saying so helps one gurl out here to feel beautiful who’s thinking of PS its worth it.”

Winter replied to the comment, writing, “I appreciate you wanting to help girls love themselves the way they are, but you are also kind of cutting someone (me) down which isn’t what I think you were trying to do?”

She continued: “I also didn’t get plastic surgery. That is also not supportive of women if you’re just assuming about the way they look.”

This isn’t the first time Winter has responded to fan’s criticism about her weight.

On Jan. 2, Winter responded to a follower that suggested she used drugs to lose weight.

“Not half as bad as all the coke/meth she uses. She literally dropped 30 pounds,” the fan wrote in the comment section of an Instagram post.

“My psychiatrist switched me from my previous anti depressant that didn’t work and made me gain weight to coke/meth!! Definitely not a new one that worked and then regulated metabolism. Coke/meth was a controversial decision but she stands by it,” Winter wrote.

The same instagram user continued to accuse Winter of using drugs and said “pills and nose candy go hand in hand with Hollywood.”

Winter responded again, writing,”I couldn’t have lost weight for any other reason just because of the industry I’m in?” she wrote. “I’m not trying to be rude, but … telling someone how something happened to them AFTER they told you what actually happened is shitty and completely arrogant.”

“Pretty annoyed about the focus on the fact that I wear shorts, and the commentary that I’m ‘squeezing’ into them or the idea that it’s not okay for me to wear shorts,” she wrote on Twitter.

“It’s SUMMER. Get over it. It’s hot, I’m obviously going to be wearing minimal clothes.”

“Also, I’m not ‘squeezing’ into anything,” Winter continued. “My shorts fit me and everything I’m doing is just fine. Please leave young women alone. We’re just living our lives.

You might have seen sneering twits in MAGA hats taunting an elder Native American, or perhaps you saw patriotic youngsters framed by a media too eager to torment U.S. president Donald Trump and his supporters. Even as the dramatic final days of the longest government shutdown in history wore on, the national conversation coalesced around who was at fault in that viral moment–and what had actually happened.

One heated point of contention around the issue, though, is what message the students’ MAGA hats inherently conveyed: innocent support for the president, or something more malevolent. Both sides-ing media outlets like Politico rushed into the fray to defend MAGA hats, while Alyssa Milano incurred a backlash for denouncing them as the new “white hoods.” Partly missing from this conversation were the cold hard facts about how many violent acts have been committed in the name of Trump’s movement. On Tuesday morning, there was a devastating reminder.

Actor Jussie Smollett, best known for his role on Empire, was reportedly beaten, taunted with homophobic and racial slurs, doused with bleach, and assaulted with a noose-like rope around the neck by two white men in ski masks, who told him, “This is MAGA country.”

Every time an undocumented immigrant commits a crime in the U.S., it becomes a multi-day story on Fox News, and a talking point for why the president should be able to build his wall. It’s a reductive generalization, a false-positive that ignores how rare such a crime must be for the people touting it to make such a big deal about each one.

So rather than extrapolate from Smollett’s beating the fact that anyone with MAGA in their vocabulary at all is a hate criminal waiting to happen, let’s take a look at those facts.

Trump’s entire platform is marked by a tendency to “Other” people of color, whether it’s Mexicans who are supposedly more likely to be rapists, Muslims who should be banned from entering the U.S., or whole nations like Haiti and Africa dismissed as “shithole countries” in contrast with majority-white Norway. (Trump’s actions with regard to the LGBT community also speak for themselves.) With this kind of rhetoric and policy, it’s no wonder hate crimes in the U.S. rose by 17% the year after Trump’s election.

Might those people have committed hate crimes no matter who was president at the time? Sure. But the attorneys for one man convicted of an anti-Muslim hate crime last year did ask the judge in the case to consider Trump‘s campaign rhetoric as a “backdrop” to the case before sentencing. Another man wearing a MAGA hat pushed a Mexican man in front of a subway in New York City, killing him. Sometimes those committing these violent acts just happen to be Trump supporters; other times they explicitly shout out their affiliation during the crime, like these 17 cases ABC found. Sometimes they get discovered with MAGA bumper stickers all over their vans after mailing pipe bombs to the president’s perceived political enemies."

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him."" Per the police, the two men beat Smollett, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him (bleach, according to TMZ) and ""wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

The men, both of whom wore ski masks to cover their faces, allegedly shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Police have not confirmed those specific details and a Chicago Police spokesperson told The Daily Beast there was ""no report"" of MAGA taunts from the attackers.

Representatives for the Chicago police department did not respond to requests for comment.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. as the actor was getting food from a Subway sandwich location after arriving to Chicago from New York. The actor reportedly suffered a fractured rib and was transported to Northwestern Memorial for treatment before being released Tuesday morning. The assault follows the arrival of a threatening letter reportedly sent to Fox's Chicago studios last week which was addressed to Smollett and contained a threat to his life along with similar hateful slurs. Entertainment Tonight reports that as a result of the attack, Smollett and the rest of the Empire cast will have armed security as the production of the show continues.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the Chicago Police Department revealed that it is investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.

Smollett was walking in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street about 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday “when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department said in a statement to The Washington Post. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.”

The police could not confirm the gender of the offenders or identify the chemical substance.

“At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victims neck,” the statement said.

Eventually the offenders fled, and Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Hospital “and is in good condition.”

AD

TMZ reported that Smollett was discharged Tuesday morning. The hospital could not confirm this detail but told The Post that Smollett was not currently a patient.

AD

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said.

Smollett told detectives his attackers said “something to the effect of ‘this is MAGA country,’” an apparent reference to President Trump’s enduring “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, during the assault. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the initial police report did not reference those comments, but the actor recalled the information in a follow-up interview with detectives.

AD

Guglielmi said Smollett still had a thin, white rope around his neck when officers first made contact with him around 2:40 a.m., roughly 40 minutes after the alleged assault. He also confirmed that the FBI is investigating a threatening letter that was sent to Smollett on Jan. 22 at the Fox studio in Chicago.

AD

The FBI has not yet responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post.

Fox released a statement Tuesday in support of the actor. “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

AD

Smollett’s publicist did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Smollett began his career as a child actor with his siblings, who include actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. He is best known for playing Jamal Lyon on “Empire.” The character is a gay R&B musician who has faced homophobic criticism from his mogul father.

AD

The character struggled with his sexuality before coming out in a buzzed-about Season 1 episode. The plot development led to widespread speculation about Smollett’s sexuality. A month later, Smollett appeared on the TV show “Ellen,” when he confirmed he is gay.

“It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet, there’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he told TV host Ellen DeGeneres. “I don’t have a closet. But I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home. So that’s why I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is, without a doubt, no closet I’ve ever been in. And I just wanted to make that clear.”

AD

He more directly addressed his sexuality in a 2016 interview with Out magazine. Though Smollett said he was open to falling in love with anyone, he identifies as a gay man.

AD

“I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I don’t know how many times I have to say that,” he told the magazine.

As news of his attack spread Tuesday, Smollett received statements of support from LGBTQ advocacy organizations he has worked with over the years.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” GLAAD said in a statement.

“This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident,” said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities — and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities.”

AD

AD

Last year, the FBI said there was a 17 percent increase in hate crimes in 2017 — the third consecutive year such crimes increased. Of the 7,175 hate crimes reported by United States law enforcement agencies, 2,013 incidents targeted black Americans. 1,130 hate crimes involved people who were targeted based on their sexual orientation.

Messages of support from fans and fellow celebrities for Smollett poured out on Twitter as the news unfolded.

Terrence Howard, the star of “Empire,” appeared on “Good Morning America” Wednesday morning, where he said Smollett was improving, though it was difficult.

“I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,” Howard said. “But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

Howard also praised Smollett, saying, “Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood. He’s the one that cheers everybody up. ”

“Empire” co-star Vivica A. Fox tweeted in all caps: “IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!! SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE! PRAYERS UP TO U NEPHEW!”

Lee Daniels, who co-created “Empire” with Danny Strong, posted a heartfelt and expletive-laden video on Instagram.

“It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this, because Jussie, you are my son,” Daniels said. “You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck . . .

Strong, meanwhile, wrote that he is “deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks.""

Smollett “is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,” Strong tweeted. “Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

“We ALL have a responsibility to rise up against the ignorance and hate out there. If you know who did this . . . REPORT THEM TO THE POLICE,” tweeted “Scandal” creator Shonda Rhimes.

“Grey’s Anatomy” actress Caterina Scorsone sent “love and healing” to the actor: “We must tirelessly teach our children about the dignity and sacredness of each and every human being so that this kind of insanity ends. Hate destroys us from within. Teach them to love. It’s on us.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) both weighed in on Twitter, calling the assault a “modern-day lynching.”

“No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin,” tweeted Harris. “We must confront this hate.”"

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” the statement from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment reads.

“We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Jussie was violently attacked by two men in Chicago, according to the police department.

The attackers were reportedly “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him,” and “began to batter the victim with their hands [around] the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”"

According to a statement from the Chicago Police Department, the 35-year-old star of Empire was approached by two offenders who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"" before they physically battered and ""poured an unknown chemical substance"" on him. Before fleeing the scene, the offenders ""wrapped a rope"" around his neck, police said. Smollett went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital and is now in ""good condition,"" according to the statement.

In 2015—the same year the character he portrays on Empire, Jamal Lyon, came out as gay—Smollett himself spoke publicly for the first time about his sexuality, in a one-on-one backstage conversation with Ellen DeGeneres.

""It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet,” Smollett said in the interview, reported by ABC. ""There's never been a closet that I've been in. I don't own a closet, I got a dresser, but I don't have a closet. But I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home. So that's why I choose not to talk about my personal life.""

In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, GLAAD said it reached out to Smollett's team to offer help, writing: ""Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.""

Other actors and advocates have been sharing messages of support on Twitter.

Smollett's character in Empire, Jamal Lyon, came out in season one's ""The Lyon's Roar."" He did it via performance, changing a lyric from his dad's hit song ""You're So Beautiful"" to: ""This the kind of song that makes a man love a man."" The plot point echoed the way Frank Ocean came out through the lyrics on his album Channel Orange and his open letter on Tumblr, and was one of the many touches that made Empire feel so authentic. It's one of the first widely broadcasted shows with a black, gay male lead, and remains one of the only TV series that addresses homophobia and abuse head on. In 2015, Nielsen reported that the show was watched in 33 percent of black households.

NASA’s asteroid-chasing spacecraft has released the most detailed views yet of its oddly-shaped target from more than 1.4 billion miles away from home.

Since OSIRIS-REx reached orbit around asteroid Bennu at the beginning of this year, its snapshots have brought us closer and closer to the nearby asteroid.

At just 1,600 feet across, Bennu is the smallest object ever to be orbited by a spacecraft.

The latest batch of images shows Bennu in staggering new detail from when OSIRIS-REx was just one mile above the surface.

NASA’s asteroid-chasing spacecraft has released the most detailed views yet of its oddly-shaped target from more than 1.4 billion miles away from home. Since OSIRIS-REx reached orbit around asteroid Bennu at the beginning of this year, its snapshots have brought us closer and closer to the nearby asteroid. The view is over Bennu's southern hemisphere

Images shared on the OSIRIS-REx Twitter account show Bennu’s south pole as the spacecraft zipped by in an initial survey.

‘As I fly around Bennu during Orbital A, my scientific cameras are not collecting data,’ the account tweeted this week.

‘But my navCam 1 imager is taking “OpNav” (short for optical navigation) images like these to help monitor my path around the asteroid.’

OSIRIS-REx left Earth more than two years ago on its mission to study an asteroid and, hopefully, bring a sample back home in 2023.

The craft will spend the next year in orbit around its target before dropping down briefly so it can get close enough to scoop up a sample of dirt and rock from the surface.

The above view comes from its latest batch of images

Right now, the craft is over a billion miles away.

‘For those keeping track at home…I’ve traveled just under 2.2 billon km (1.4 billion miles) since leaving home in Sept 2016,’ the account tweeted.

‘I’ll remain in orbit around Bennu until late February when I begin a series of flybys for Detailed Survey.’

Osiris-Rex’ ultimate goal is to bring back a regolith sample of at least 2.1 ounces.

Asteroid Bennu is said to be a carbon-rich hunk of rock that might contain organic materials or molecular precursors to life.

The craft will spend the next year in orbit around its target before dropping down briefly so it can get close enough to scoop up a sample of dirt and rock from the surface

'Analyzing a sample from Bennu will help planetary scientists better understand the role asteroids may have played in delivering life-forming compounds to Earth,' NASA explains.

'We know from having studied Bennu through Earth- and space-based telescopes that it is a carbonaceous, or carbon-rich, asteroid. Carbon is the hinge upon which organic molecules hang.

'Bennu is likely rich in organic molecules, which are made of chains of carbon bonded with atoms of oxygen, hydrogen, and other elements in a chemical recipe that makes all known living things.

'Besides carbon, Bennu also might have another component important to life: water, which is trapped in the minerals that make up the asteroid.'"

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him."" Per the police, the two men beat Smollett, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him (bleach, according to TMZ) and ""wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

The men, both of whom wore ski masks to cover their faces, allegedly shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Police have not confirmed those specific details and a Chicago Police spokesperson told The Daily Beast there was ""no report"" of MAGA taunts from the attackers.

Representatives for the Chicago police department did not respond to requests for comment.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. as the actor was getting food from a Subway sandwich location after arriving to Chicago from New York. The actor reportedly suffered a fractured rib and was transported to Northwestern Memorial for treatment before being released Tuesday morning. The assault follows the arrival of a threatening letter reportedly sent to Fox's Chicago studios last week which was addressed to Smollett and contained a threat to his life along with similar hateful slurs. Entertainment Tonight reports that as a result of the attack, Smollett and the rest of the Empire cast will have armed security as the production of the show continues.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the Chicago Police Department revealed that it is investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.

The African-American actor, who is openly gay and plays gay character Jamal Lyon on Empire, was leaving a Subway restaurant around 2am when he was recognized by two white men in ski masks who referred to him using racial and homophobic slurs and referenced his role on the TV show, reports TMZ. The men struck Smollett in the face, poured a chemical (possibly bleach) on him, and put a rope around his neck a la a noose, according to a police report. TMZ reports the men also yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" before departing.

Smollett was treated at a hospital for injuries including a fractured rib and released, per TMZ. ""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" reads a police statement, per Entertainment Tonight. Per TMZ and That Grape Juice, the site that first reported the attack, a threatening letter naming Smollett and also appearing to contain a ""MAGA"" reference was sent to Fox Studios in Chicago a little over a week ago. Smollett only arrived in Chicago on a flight from New York a few hours before the attack. In an Instagram post, the 35-year-old had described ""spending 7 hours on a plane for a 2 hour flight."" (A man was accused of using his vehicle in a possible hate crime.)

According to a statement from the Chicago Police Department, Smollett arrived in Chicago from New York and was walking on East North Lower Water Street to get something to eat at 2 a.m. CT. He was approached by two men yelling homophobic and racial slurs. The two men beat him and poured an unknown chemical on him. A source said the substance might have been bleach.

The offenders continued to wrap a rope around Smollett’s neck and fled the scene.

Smollett was able to bring himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was listed in good condition, and the extent of his injuries is unknown.

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLADD) released a statement saying GLADD reached out to Smollet’s management and FOX to offer any assistance which may be needed. Smollett is considered a champion and role model for the LGBT community and is loved around the world.

Smollett plays Jamal Lyons on “Empire,” the estranged son of Terence Howard who is a music-industry model. On the show, Lyons is a singer-songwriter is gay, and his family has difficulty accepting it.

Actor-singer Jussie Smollett was the victim of an alleged hate crime assault in Chicago.

Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi released two photos of the ""persons of interest."" He also published them on Twitter.

Investigators ""for the most part"" can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said.

However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, 36, who is black and gay and plays the role of Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area.

But he said they still need to collect and view more.

He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor ""is at home and recovering.""

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant.

Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.""

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country"" — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

The victim, who Chicago police identified as the 36-year-old man who stars on ""Empire,"" was leaving a restaurant about 2 a.m. when he was approached by two unknown men yelling racial and homophobic slurs, police say.

After gaining Smollett’s attention, the men punched him and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, police say. At one point during the attack, one of the suspects wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck, according to police.

The suspects fled the scene and Smollett brought himself to a hospital. He was in good condition and fully cooperating with the investigation Tuesday, police say.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police said in a statement.

Before the attack began, one of the suspects yelled “Aren’t you that f****** ‘Empire’ n*****?” TMZ reported.

Both suspects were white and wearing ski masks, according to TMZ.

The website reported that the chemical poured on Smollett was bleach and that one of the men yelled “This is MAGA country,” referencing President Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make American Great Again.”

Smollett had traveled to Chicago from New York and appeared to be relieved to have finally finished what had become a long day of travelling, according to a social media post.

""#Mood after spending 7 hours on a plane for a 2 hour flight but finally landing all good. Love y’all. Goodnight,"" he wrote on Instagram.

On the Fox show ""Empire,"" Smollett plays musician Jamal Lyon, the son of Terrence Howard’s Lucious and Taraji P. Henson’s Cookie. The character is gay. Smollett said during a 2015 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that he is gay, but prefers to keep his personal life private.

“There is no closet, there’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he said. “So that’s why I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in, and I just wanted to make that clear, but it was most important for me to make that clear to you on your show at this time in the world. And that’s where I’m at.”

He again spoke about being himself during an interview with Attitude magazine in August 2016.

""I get tired of the idea of someone telling me what my truth is,"" Smollett said. ""I've said from the beginning of my journey: I do not hide who I am. I love who I love.

“No one is going to tell me that somehow that is going to be my disability,” he said. “I am told so many times that I should not walk truly in my blackness. That I should not walk truly in my sexuality, I should not walk truly in who I am.

“I say thanks but no thanks, f*** you and goodbye,” he continued. “I honestly think that me being myself has actually helped my career move forward.""

GLAAD said in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter that it reached out to Fox and to Smollett’s team to offer any help needed.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” the statement said.

As word of Tuesday’s attack spread, friends and costars took to social media to offer Smollett their support and condemn his attackers.

“I'm just now hearing the news about the senseless hate attack on my #EMPiRE Nephew @JussieSmollett,” wrote Vivica A. Fox. “IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!! SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE! PRAYERS UP TO U NEPHEW!”

“I can’t believe this happened,” tweeted CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who wrote she saw Smollett last week. “It is sad and disgusting and deplorable.”

“This is so awful,” actor Billy Eichner wrote. “Sending love to @JussieSmollett.”

Detectives with the Chicago police are working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline, officials said.

The men, both of whom wore ski masks to cover their faces, allegedly shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Police have not confirmed those specific details and a Chicago Police spokesperson told The Daily Beast there was ""no report"" of MAGA taunts from the attackers.

Representatives for the Chicago police department did not respond to requests for comment.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. as the actor was getting food from a Subway sandwich location after arriving to Chicago from New York. The actor reportedly suffered a fractured rib and was transported to Northwestern Memorial for treatment before being released Tuesday morning. The assault follows the arrival of a threatening letter reportedly sent to Fox's Chicago studios last week which was addressed to Smollett and contained a threat to his life along with similar hateful slurs. Entertainment Tonight reports that as a result of the attack, Smollett and the rest of the Empire cast will have armed security as the production of the show continues.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the Chicago Police Department revealed that it is investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.

“Hold your head up, Jussie. I’m with you. I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another f**ing day in America.”

Stars vowed to stand up to hate after Jussie Smollett attack

Other friends and Hollywood stars also offered their support.

Pose star Ryan Jamaal Swain tweeted: “This is why holding ‘a little homophobic joke’ accountable is taken so FREAKING SERIOUSLY. To quote @amandaseales, you have to be overly confident…black gay men have to deal w/ not only racism but homophobia.

According to TMZ’s initial report, the two men said to the actor, “Aren’t you that fa**ot Empire ni**er?” before violently beating him, fracturing his rib, pouring bleach on him, tying a noose around his neck and yelling “This is MAGA country.”

It is important that we discuss this matter detailing that this attack was not just homophobic, but also racist. Media has already begun running the hate crime angle as homophobia, although it is very clear this is tied to more of the same racist MAGA actions we have seem become emboldened as of late. Because Jussie was attacked in Chicago, media will attempt to paint this as a simple “homophobic” attack, knowing most won’t read past the headlines and assume the abusers were Black. It is important that we do our due diligence in discussing the totality of how dangerous it is when a person lives in multiple marginalized communities.

It is very clear that MAGA is nothing more than a hate group protected because of how tied in it is with the President—who has also been proven on many occasions to participate in racism and homophobia. The slogan in of itself is a racist ideology. At what point has America prior to now been “Great” for marginalized groups? What era are they looking to go back to when America was so great? Questions that have never been asked, but actions that continue to let us know that the only agenda is white supremacy.

Nothing Funny about a Homophobic “Joke”

The attack on Jussie Smollett hurts personally. Being someone who identifies as Black and Queer in the media who knows mutual friends and mentors of him hurts. Knowing that the threats I’ve received for my sexuality and my race can so easily turn into actions makes me angry. Knowing that every day I must walk the world as a Black Queer person with a target on my back is sometimes so heavy that some of us never leave the house. Some of us never get out of the bed. Watching our own be attacked, while failing to get the support of “allies” is a reminder that as Black Queer people, only we can protect ourselves.

This is why we get so angry every time someone makes a homophobic joke. There is no such thing as a homophobic joke. Homophobic jokes become thoughts in people’s heads. Thoughts become actions. Those actions become violence and we end up where we are today, where one of the most visible Black Queer people in the world could have lost his life just that easily. It’s why we go so hard at the Kevin Harts of the world to understand that this isn’t a joke, it is our lives on the line. It is why we critique Ellen so hard because the time for you to speak up against your white community and MAGA is now. Where are you during these times when there is no money on the line?

It is also important that we discuss how visibility is not the answer to correcting homophobia, transphobia or racism, and in fact often makes us more of a target. Symbolism is a dangerous slope that many in this country have tied to real progress. However, visibility of more identities at the top doesn’t necessarily trickle down into community. As we see with Smollett, his visibility has provided him no protection from the heinous acts of violence that many who are like him at a different class level face on a daily basis.

The Hazardous Intersection of Race and Sexuality

Over the last few weeks we have seen how the intersection of race and sexuality continues to harm Black LGBTQ folks. Over the last 18 months two Black gay men have been found dead in the home of wealthy white Democratic donor Ed Buck, who has not been charged with a crime. We have already recorded the first transgender murder of the year as well; which media continues to fail at reporting. The violence faced by Black Queer people places us in an environment where community opinion is almost as if we are bringing this violence to ourselves. As if this is some sort of punishment for living our lives outside of the heteronormative.

Days like today are hard, and unfortunately for us despite our rage and sadness as Black Queer people we will still need to find a way to make it through our days. Visibility won’t save us. Silence in our death is complicity in the violence we face. We can only hope for a day that our Blackness isn’t reduced by our Queerness, and that neither are a threat to our existence. Today is further proof that America is not great, never has been great, and may never be great in our lifetime.

Jussie Smollett, a black, openly gay actor best known for his work in Fox's ""Empire,"" was assaulted in Chicago by two people carrying a noose and an unidentified ""chemical substance"" in what police are calling a ""possible racially-charged assault and battery."" Smollett, 35, was walking on the 300th block of E. North Lower Water Street around 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday, ""when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a statement to The Washington Post. ""The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim."" The police could not confirm the gender of the offenders nor identify the chemical substance. ""At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck,"" the statement continued. Eventually, the offenders fled the scene, and Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Hospital ""and is in good condition.""

TMZ reported that Smollett was discharged Tuesday morning. The hospital could not confirm this detail but told The Washington Post that Smollett is not currently a patient.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" police said.

Smollett's publicist did not immediately respond to The Post's request for comment.

Smollett began his career as a child actor, along with his siblings who include actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. He is best known for playing Jamal Lyon on ""Empire."" The character is a gay R&B musician who has faced homophobic criticism from his mogul father.

The character struggled with his sexuality before coming out in a buzzed-about Season 1 episode. The plot development led to widespread speculation about Smollett's sexuality. A month later, Smollett appeared on ""Ellen,"" where he confirmed he is gay.

""It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet, there's never been a closet that I've been in,"" he told host Ellen DeGeneres. ""I don't have a closet. But I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home. So that's why I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is, without a doubt, no closet I've ever been in. And I just wanted to make that clear.""

He more directly addressed his sexuality in a 2016 interview with Out magazine. Though Smollett said he was open to falling in love with anyone, he said he identifies as a gay man.

""I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I don't know how many times I have to say that,"" he told the magazine.

""Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,"" GLAAD told the Hollywood Reporter in a statement following the attack.

According to CNN, Smollett was jumped in the wee hours of Tuesday morning (January 29) by two assailants “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.”

TMZ reports the two masked men screamed, “This is MAGA country” during the incident and asked, “Aren’t you that faggot off Empire?”

Smollett was physically attacked and the alleged attackers “poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim” and also put a rope around his neck. Both quickly fled the scene.

In the 911 call obtained by The Blast, a friend told the dispatcher Smollett “was assaulted when he walked out of his apartment.” The official noted the victim is “supposed to be well known” and that a “noose” was placed over his neck.

As a result, Smollett was taken to Northwestern Hospital where he was reportedly in “good condition.” He was released several hours later.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” a police statement said.

Although the event appeared random, it’s possible it was premeditated. Approximately eight days ago, a letter targeting Smollett was sent to FOX Studios.

“You will die black fag,” it said. In the top left corner of the envelope, it appears to read, “MAGA.”

Smollett has been on the popular FOX show since 2015. He plays gay singer Jamal and is part of the Lyons family. Like his character, Smollett also identifies as gay.

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett was hospitalized Tuesday in Chicago after he was targeted by two attackers who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him and tied a rope around his neck.

The incident is being investigated by the Chicago Police Department as a possible hate crime, chief spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

Smollett, 36, was walking in the city early Tuesday when he was approached by his attackers, who earned his attention by shouting racial and homophobic slurs in his direction.

The pair then beat up the actor with their hands, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene.

Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital, and is currently in good condition.

TMZ reports Smollett’s attackers were two white men who yelled, “This is MAGA country,” while carrying out the assault.

The gossip site also reports that the chemical substance was bleach, and that Smollett suffered a fractured rib, but has since been released from the hospital.

A rep for the star did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Smollett, born in Santa Rosa in 1983, is a former child star who has appeared in films like “The Mighty Ducks” and “North,” though his most notable role is as Jamal Lyon in the Fox drama “Empire.”

He’s been a series regular since the show premiered in 2015, and has won a slew of NAACP Image Awards for the role.

Smollett came out as gay in 2015 on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”"

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was reported to be in good condition after taking himself to a hospital after the incident early on Tuesday, police said.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police said in a statement.

Police did not identify Smollett by name, but gave his age and said he had a role on “Empire.” The show’s co-creator, Lee Daniels, and representatives from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment confirmed he was the victim.

“We have to love each other, regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united,” Daniels said in a profanity-laced video on his Instagram account.

“Hold your head up Jussie,” Lee added.

The two unknown assailants, police said, approached Smollett on the street about 2 a.m. CST and began a “possible racially motivated” attack, yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

The assailants hit him in the face, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives were gathering video of the area and looking for witnesses.

A representative for Smollett did not respond to requests for comment.

“Empire,” a hip-hop musical drama series, premiered on Fox Television in 2015. Its lead actress, Taraji P. Henson, won a Golden Globe Award in 2016 for her role and the show has received multiple Emmy Award nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Smollett’s colleagues said they were shocked.

“The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,” Empire co-creator Danny Strong said on Twitter.

Raquel Willis, an African-American transgender rights activist and executive editor of Out magazine, a lifestyle publication that centers on the LGBT community, condemned the attack on Twitter.

“The hate that fuels white supremacy is the same hate that fuels homophobia,” Willis said. “A conscientious society realizes it’s at war with both.”"

The report went on to say that, “The 2 men — both white and wearing ski masks — viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

A CNN report said that Smollett was admitted to Northwestern Hospital and is in “good condition” according to police.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said according to the CNN report.

Beyond being an openly gay black man, Smollett portrays one in his “Empire” role. Also a board member for The Black AIDS Institute, he advocates for HIV/AIDS awareness and LGBTQ visibility. According to a previous Between The Lines interview with Smollett, he said he is “humbled” by the opportunity to provide visibility for the black LGBTQ community.

“And it makes me grateful. I just remember that there was nobody I could see on TV who I could identify with. The very first person that I ever saw who was gay at all, like any member of the LGBTQ community that I could somewhat identify with, was Wilson Cruz (as Rickie Vasquez) on “My So-Called Life.” He was someone of color, and I grew up loving people like Elton John, but I couldn’t identify with Elton John because that’s all I saw,” Smollett said. “I didn’t put two and two together – it wasn’t representation.”"

Actor Jussie Smollett is reportedly hospitalized after an apparent hate crime.

According to TMZ, two men wearing ski masks attacked the Empire star in Chicago around 2 A.M. The attackers approached the 35-year-old actor, beat him up, yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him and poured bleach on him.

Sources close to Smollett told TMZ that the two white males viscously attacked Smollett as he was leaving a Subway restaurant. One of the men allegedly yelled, “Aren’t you that f—ot Empire ni—r?”

TMZ reports that the two men beat him, wrapped a rope around his neck in the form of a noose and poured bleach on him. Before leaving the scene one of the men yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

TMZ confirms that Jussie went to Northwestern Memorial hospital Tuesday morning where here he is receiving treatment.

Terry Crews has joined other sexual violence survivors to narrate a powerful #MeToo video.

The actor is one of four survivors who took part in the public service announcements that were screened at the Sundance Film Festival on Sunday and released on the #MeToo Movement’s YouTube channel on Monday.

‘I will not be shamed,’ Crews declares in the two minute video. ‘I did nothing wrong.’

He finishes, ‘Please, please to any survivor out there, repeat that mantra over and over until you believe it.’

Last year, the actor and Endeavour agent Adam Venit agreed to settle a lawsuit in which Crews accused Venit of groping him at a Hollywood party.

‘ACCOUNTABILITY,’ the actor tweeted at the time, while linking to an article stating Venit was planning to leave the agency.

In 2017, Crews revealed in a series of tweets that he had been groped by a then unnamed Hollywood boss in front of his wife.

He said he initially kept the incident quiet because he was afraid of the man’s power in Hollywood.

However, after news broke about Harvey Weinstein’s sexual assault allegations in light of the #MeToo movement, he felt compelled to share his story.

The 35-year-old actor was attacked on Tuesday in Chicago by two men who put a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him.

Police said the incident was “possibly racially charged” and the men shouted “racial and homophobic slurs”.

Smollett was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Police said Smollett was in “good condition”.

A police statement said the Chicago Police Department received a report of a “possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire. Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”

Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, the gay son of a music mogul, in the popular Fox drama.

The statement continued: “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

The King Centre for Nonviolent Social Change, which promotes racial equality in the US and was founded by Martin Luther King Jr’s wife, said it was praying for Smollett.

A tweet from the nongovernmental organisation said: “The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever rising tides of hate.

Two MAGA-supporting men brutally beat up Jussie Smollett in Chicago early on the morning of Jan. 29th. The men put a noose around the Empire star’s neck and screamed, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett had traveled to Chicago from New York late Monday, and went to get something to eat at a Subway round 2 a.m., according to a TMZ source. As he walked out of the eatery, someone reportedly yelled, “Aren’t you that f—got Empire n—ger?”

Smollett fought back during the beating, but the men, who donned ski masks and have been identified as white, got the better of him in the vicious attack that left Smollett with a broken rib. In addition to reportedly using homophobic slurs, the attackers also put a noose around Smollett’s neck and poured bleach on him. Chicago Police are investigating the beating as a hate crime.

Smollett was treated at Northwestern Memorial and was discharged Tuesday morning.

In an odd twist of events, eight days prior to the attack, Fox Studios in Chicago received a letter with a message spelling, “You will die black f—.” Jussie Smollett’s name and MAGA are also written on the envelope in which the letter arrived.

Empire cast and crew held an emergency meeting Tuesday to reveal what happened to Smollett. They were extremely upset, reports TMZ. Some actors had been preparing to come to set when they received the news. There are only a few episodes left to shoot in the season. There was discussion of getting extra security on the set while shooting.

Empire Executive Producer Danny Strong, along with some of Smollett’s Hollywood and political friends, took to social media to express their love for Smollett and dismay that the incident occurred.

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels addressed Smollett directly in an emotional Instagram video.

“Jussie, you are my son,” Daniels said. “You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, or to be called ‘Die, faggot, nigger,’ or whatever they said to you.

We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united on [a] united front.

Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital and “is in good condition,” authorities said.

As of Tuesday evening, a Chicago police spokesperson told CNN that investigators canvassed the neighborhood where the reported attack occurred and have found no still images or video from security cameras of the incident.

The only image of Smollett police obtained from security cameras was inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime. The actor was seen standing alone.

Chicago police detectives continue to investigate the “serious allegations,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said early Wednesday.

“The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras. As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders,” he said.

“Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect’s vehicle to be able to share.”

Guglielmi said detective teams will broaden their search area and work around the clock to look for video on traffic cameras, buses and neighboring streets.

A dozen police detectives, with the assistance of the FBI, are working the case, he said.

CNN’s Don Lemon spoke to Smollett and a mutual friend who was at the hospital with the actor. Smollett confirmed the incident took place.

He was shaken and angry that an attack like this could happen. Smollett told CNN he fought back at the attackers.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” the police statement said.

Investigators are testing the chemical Smollett said he was doused with and have yet to confirm the nature of the substance.

Smollett has starred on Fox’s “Empire” since 2015. He plays Jamal, a successful singer in the musical Lyon family. Like his character, Smollett identifies as gay.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our ‘Empire’ family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” a representative of 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to CNN. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

A representative for GLAAD told CNN the organization has reached out Smollett to offer assistance and support.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” a GLAAD spokesperson said in a statement.

According to The Blast, Chicago investigators are “canvassing” the area around a restaurant in the 300 block of East Lower Water Street for external cameras and other video recording equipment that may have caught the attack early Tuesday morning.

As was previously reported, the 36-year-old actor had been exiting a Chicago restaurant when two men wearing ski masks attacked him in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime. The men, who have not yet been identified, allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at Smollett, physically attacked him with their hands, and poured an unknown chemical substance over him before they proceeded to wrap a rope around his neck.

Smollett was hospitalized as a result of the attack but has since been released and is said to be doing well.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Chicago Police Department said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter.

Currently, no video footage of the incident has been found, and no suspects have been named or apprehended. Authorities are also looking for witnesses.

In response to the attack, social media was flooded with celebrities voicing their support for Smollett.

“I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett,” Empire co-creator Danny Strong tweeted. “He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live. Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.""

The attack has also garnered the response of a number of prominent LGBTQ organizations, including GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ civil rights organization.

Smollett, who plays musician Jamal Lyon in the Fox series, confirmed during a 2015 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that he identifies as gay.

“There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he said, adding that his decision to keep his personal life private was not an attempt to “hide or deny who God made me. There is, without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in.”"

They also hurled homophobic and racist slurs at him.

According to TMZ, the attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to the Make America Great Again acronym often used by President Trump.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” a police spokesperson stated.

Jussie was able to carry himself to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for his injuries.

It’s been reported that he is in good condition and fully cooperating with Chicago police.

Jussie Smollett has always been a big critic of Donald Trump, and was vocal about his opposition to the President ahead of the 2016 election.

“I think that [Trump] is truly one of the worst people that has ever walked the face of this planet. I can’t talk about him without getting heated and I get so emotional about it,” he said.

“I’m so emotional about it because I feel it so deeply. And I’m also ashamed. I’m embarrassed for our nation, that we allowed someone like this to get so far.

As of Tuesday evening, police said they had yet to find surveillance video that showed the crime. ""Thus far, no video of the alleged assailants or a vehicle has been discovered but we are continuing to broaden our search,"" Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.

TMZ first reported details of the attack.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Guglielmi said in a statement.

""Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come,"" Strong tweeted.

FBI data released last year showed a 17 percent increase in hate crimes between 2016 and 2017. Hate crimes based on race, ethnicity or ancestry were the most common, making up about 60 percent of the total. The FBI's latest report also found 15.8 percent of hate crime offenses in 2017 stemmed from sexual orientation bias. Between 2016 and 2017, hate crimes motivated by racial bias rose about 18 percent and attacks on LGBTQ individuals rose 5 percent, according to the FBI.

The Anti-Violence project notes the severity of hate violence against LGBTQ people is increasing, with 46 percent of LGBTQ hate violence victims sustaining an injury in 2017 compared with 31 percent in 2016.

The police could not confirm the gender of the offenders nor identify the chemical substance.

“At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victims neck,” the statement continued.

Eventually, the offenders fled the scene, and Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Hospital “and is in good condition.”

TMZ reported that Smollett was discharged Tuesday morning. The hospital could not confirm this detail but told The Washington Post that Smollett is not currently a patient.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said.

Smollett’s publicist did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Smollett began his career as a child actor, along with his siblings who include actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. He is best known for playing Jamal Lyon on “Empire.” The character is a gay R&B musician who has faced homophobic criticism from his mogul father.

The character struggled with his sexuality before coming out in a buzzed-about Season 1 episode. The plot development led to widespread speculation about Smollett’s sexuality. A month later, Smollett appeared on “Ellen,” where he confirmed he is gay.

“It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet, there’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he told host Ellen DeGeneres. “I don’t have a closet. But I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home. So that’s why I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is, without a doubt, no closet I’ve ever been in. And I just wanted to make that clear.”

He more directly addressed his sexuality in a 2016 interview with Out magazine. Though Smollett said he was open to falling in love with anyone, he said he identifies as a gay man.

“I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I don’t know how many times I have to say that,” he told the magazine.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” GLAAD told the Hollywood Reporter in a statement following the attack."

Chicago Police are investigating the attack of ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett after it was confirmed that an earlier threat, in the form of a letter, was made towards the actor.

Chicago Police confirm to ABC News that the FBI is assisting in the investigation of Tuesday morning's brutal attack.

Smollett was hospitalized earlier today in what authorities are investigating as a ""possible hate crime.""

The 36-year-old ""Empire"" actor was in Chicago early Tuesday, walking outside, when someone shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, police said.

Two men then attacked the actor, poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, Smollett told police. The rope was still around Smollett's neck when he was found, officials said.

Smollett told police, in a follow-up interview, that the suspects yelled ""MAGA country"" during the attack.

Authorities have obtained a surveillance image of Smollett inside of the Subway restaurant before the attack but do not have any video of the assailants, officials said.

Smollett was treated at the nearby Northwestern Memorial Hospital, police said, adding that they ""are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.""

The letter threatening Smollett before the attack was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago on Jan. 22, police said. The letter contained threatening language and was laced with a powdery substance that investigators believe was likely Tylenol.

The FBI is now investigating that prior threat, police said.

""Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com,"" police said in their earlier statement.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday, ""Empire"" co-star Terrence Howard said a production manager notified the cast about the attack in a meeting on set Tuesday.

""Jaws dropped to the ground,"" Howard said, recalling the emergency cast meeting. ""And then when we learned that there had been letters sent to Fox as threats about the potential for something like this and then we became much more frightened.

""As far as I know, for 17 hours a day, Jussie Smollett is my son. So you're feeling this helplessness, this hopelessness that your children -- the people that you love -- aren't safe,"" he added.

The actor said Fox boosted security on set in the wake of the incident and offered each cast member 24-hour personal security.

""It was offered up today that we could have 24-hour security. Someone parked in front of our house during the evening, someone to drive us, or to follow us to and from work,"" Howard told ""GMA.""

""Unfortunately, without Fox paying for that, that's about $1,200 a day worth of security,"" he added. ""It makes it hard for people not to want to think about going and just getting a license to carry a concealed weapon because it would be much cheaper, but then what does that say about our country?""

""Empire"" creator Lee Daniels spoke out passionately in an Instagram video later Tuesday about the young star, calling Smollett ""my son.""

""You didn't deserve, nor does anybody deserve to have a noose put around your neck,"" he says in a video. ""To be called 'Die f----, n-----, or whatever they said to you. You are better than that. We are, America is better than that.""

Daniels tried to stop himself from breaking down as he asked everyone watching to love each other, no matter their sexual orientation.

""Hold your head up Jussie, I'm with you, I'll be there in a minute,"" he added.

""Empire"" executive producer Danny Strong said in a series of tweets, ""I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett. He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live. whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.""

Co-star Vivica A. Fox also spoke out.

Smollett's ""Empire"" character, Jamal, is the son of a hip-hop mogul who initially has trouble accepting that Jamal is gay.

Fox, the network that airs ""Empire,"" added a statement of its own about the attack, writing, ""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate -- and especially against one of our own.”

After hitting it big in ""Empire,"" Smollett said he likes to stay away from talking about his personal life, but he did speak about how he identifies to Ellen DeGeneres in 2015.

""There's never been a closet that I've been in,"" he said. ""There is, without a doubt, no closet that I've ever been in, and I just wanted to make that clear.""

In previous interviews, Smollett wouldn't talk about his sexuality but did say fans and others shouldn't try to fit him into any box.

After those statements in 2015, fellow cast member Taraji P. Henson wrote on Twitter, ""So proud of you!!!!!""

Beyond being an actor, Smollett is an outspoken activist and a symbol of hope to many fans.

He was recently inducted into the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project earlier this month and publicly announced he was supporting Time's Up's 4 percent challenge to get more female talent calling the creative shots on important Hollywood projects.

GLAAD released a statement Tuesday evening, praising Smollett for always using ""his voice and talent to create a better world.""

""Our hearts are with Jussie Smollett as he recovers from a hate-motivated and repugnant attack in Chicago. Jussie has always used his voice and talent to create a better world, and it is disgusting that anyone, especially someone who has done such good for so many, would be targeted by undeniable hatred,"" the statement read in part.

Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the FBI was leading the investigation into the alleged attack. The FBI is investigating the prior threat against Smollett.

Actor Jussie Smollett is in the hospital after being brutally attacked in Chicago in what police are treating as a likely hate crime. The 35-year-old star of the hit show “Empire” was reportedly approached by two people who yelled racist and homophobic slurs, then physically beat him and poured an “unknown chemical substance” onto him, according to a report by the Chicago police.

“At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck,” the report continues. The attackers fled, and the “possible racially-charged assault” is under investigation by the Area Central Detectives. Smollett was able to take himself to the hospital; police report that he is in “good condition.”

The charismatic young actor and singer has been open about his gay identity and is an outspoken champion of LGBT and black rights. His father, an Ashkenazi Jew, died just before Smollett’s rise to fame.

“I don’t believe that we were created to hate,” he told Out Magazine in 2016, adding that executives behind “Empire” have asked him to cool it with public statements about violence against black Americans. “I believe that we were created only to love,” he added. “Love is the root of the happiest of times and of wars. Love, or lack of love — but love is the root of everything.”

TMZ reports that Smollett’s attackers yelled “This is MAGA country,” and called the actor “That f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****” before pouring bleach on him and putting him in the noose.

A statement from Chicago police says the man said he was walking downtown about 2 a.m. Tuesday when two men approached him shouting, then struck him in the face and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him before one wrapped a rope around his neck.

Smollett has been attacked by two men in Chicago which has resulted in his hospitalization. Two suspect planned an ambushed attack outside a restaurant, we gather. More news is trickling in on this and it is not very clear yet if the attack was motivated and it could perhaps indicate an intentional hurt caused due to racial profiling. The suspects launched an attack on the actor before which they were reportedly heard shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

Smollett who is an openly gay had received a threat before. He had received a threatening letter with magazine cut out that said: “You will die black f**.” Multiple reports reported by citing additional sources that Smollett was attacked around 2 a.m. in Chicago. Two unidentified men wearing ski masks and wrapped a noose around the actor’s neck.

Smollett, 35, was walking on the 300th block of E. North Lower Water Street around 2am local time on Tuesday (Jan 29), ""when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a statement to The Washington Post.

""The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.""

The police could not confirm the gender of the offenders nor identify the chemical substance.

""At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victims neck,"" the statement continued.

Eventually, the offenders fled the scene, and Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Hospital ""and is in good condition.""

TMZ reported that Smollett was discharged on Tuesday morning.

The hospital could not confirm this detail but told The Washington Post that Smollett is not currently a patient.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" police said.

Smollett's publicist did not immediately respond to The Post's request for comment.

Smollett began his career as a child actor, along with his siblings who include actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. He is best known for playing Jamal Lyon on Empire. The character is a gay R&B musician who has faced homophobic criticism from his mogul father.

The character struggled with his sexuality before coming out in a buzzed-about Season 1 episode. The plot development led to widespread speculation about Smollett's sexuality. A month later, Smollett appeared on Ellen, where he confirmed he is gay.

""It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet, there's never been a closet that I've been in,"" he told host Ellen DeGeneres. ""I don't have a closet. But I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home. So that's why I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is, without a doubt, no closet I've ever been in. And I just wanted to make that clear.""

He more directly addressed his sexuality in a 2016 interview with Out magazine. Though Smollett said he was open to falling in love with anyone, he said he identifies as a gay man.

""I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I don't know how many times I have to say that,"" he told the magazine.

""Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,"" GLAAD told the Hollywood Reporter in a statement following the attack."

On the eve of Black History Month, Jussie Smollett survived what can only be described as an attempted lynching at the hands of two white men.

The attack happened in Chicago at around 2AM on Tuesday morning. According to sources, Smollett went into a sandwich shop for a bite to eat when one of the two men, who are being described as white and wearing ski masks, shouted, “Aren’t you that f*ggot ‘Empire’ n*gger?”

The men pounced on Smollett, beating him so badly that they fractured one of his ribs. After pinning him down, they put a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him, and shouted “This is MAGA country!” before fleeing the scene.

Smollett was taken to a local hospital where he was treated and later released. The Chicago Police Department are now investigating.

It’s the end of an era for Star Wars fans as Anthony Daniels has filmed his last ever scenes as C-3PO.

The actor, who has voiced the droid from the very beginning – way back in 1977 – has officially decided to hang up his metallic suit, after wrapping on the upcoming Episode IX.

And the 72-year-old shared a sweet tribute to his character, as well as director J.J. Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy, President of LucasFilm, for all their help.

Today was 3PO's last on Episode IX. He's sad – so am I. But we're so proud to have worked with such a lovely, talented cast & crew lead by J.J. & Kathy.

‘I’ll miss everyone but I’m glad to know that we’ve been making something exceptional together, to share with the waiting world.’

Fans rushed to share sweet messages to Anthony, thanking him for his work on the film franchise.

‘Much love to you and the crew. And if this should be your last outing, a hearty thank you from yours truly. 3PO has been an absolute joy and one of my favourite characters of the entire saga,’ one posted.

‘Thank you for your hard work and talent!! We’re all so excited to see 3PO in December,’ a fan said.

While a Twitter user added: ‘Thank you for all of the wonderful memories! 3PO has been a part of my life since the very beginning. We can’t wait to see what’s in store.’

Us too, hun. Us too.

Anthony made history with the Star Wars films, and is the only actor to appear in every single live action movie – with C-3PO making his debut in 1977.

While the character didn’t appear in Solo: A Star Wars Story, the actor made a cameo as con artist Tak.

However, he had one request before taking part in the new trilogy, asking J.J. Abrams he wanted a new suit because his original one was so uncomfortable.

Which is fair enough.

‘It’s unconformable in all the places that when it is uncomfortable, it’s very uncomfortable,’ he previously confessed.

‘When JJ asked me to be in the costume I said yes, but can we get a new one? After 40 years I think we have to change. It was beginning to smell pretty bad. And they 3D printed it.’

Star Wars: Episode IX will be released in cinemas in December.

Smollett was reportedly attacked around 2 A.M. on Tuesday, after leaving a Subway restaurant on the North Side of Chicago. The Empire actor was harangued by two white men wearing ski masks who shouted racial and homophobic epithets at him before pouring a ""chemical substance"" assumed to be bleach on him while wrapping a noose around his neck, beating him, and reportedly yelling, ""This is MAGA country.""

The incident was initially reported by TheGrapeJuice.net and TMZ, then confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter after police issued a statement to the publication while the story was still developing. ""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" the police told THR. According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after the attackers fled the scene and has since been discharged in good condition.

After it was revealed that Jamal, Smollett's character on Empire, was gay, the actor appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to address his sexuality, telling the host, ""There's never been a closet that I've been in,"" as he announced that his story paralleled his character's on the show to some degree. In recent years, Smollett has also become a spokesperson for organizations like The Trevor Project to prevent suicide amongst LBGTQ youth, and according to Deadline, GLAAD issued a statement calling the actor a ""true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.” The initial reports of the attack revealed that the actor received a letter at Fox Studios (where Empire is often filmed) which read ""You will die black f--"" in cutout letters on the inside and had ""MAGA"" written in all caps on the envelope.

Fans and friends of the actor took to Twitter and Instagram to spread their support for Smollett, as some also expressed outrage and questioned the ""randomness"" of the event, insisting that the alleged hate crime could have been premeditated if the suspects had chemicals and ski masks at the ready. Celebrities including Al Sharpton, Margaret Cho, and Zendaya have shared their responses expressing their shock and concern, and calls for solidarity with the LGBTQ community. Comedian Yassir Lester called for donations to LGBTQ organizations and demanded, ""don’t ever tell people in a marginalized group ever to be quiet or stop complaining because we always have to be on the defensive, and when we’re silent things like this happen.""

(Reuters) – Chicago police on Tuesday said they were investigating an assault on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett as a possible hate crime after two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs and at one point wrapped a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was reported to be in good condition after taking himself to a hospital after the incident early Tuesday, police said.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police said in a statement.

A representative for Smollett could not be reached for immediate comment. Police did not identify Smollett by name, but gave his age and said he had a role on “Empire.” Other media outlets cited unnamed sources as identifying Smollett as the victim.

Police said the two unknown assailants approached Smollett on the street at about 2 a.m. CST (3.00 a.m. ET) and began a “possible racially motivated” attack, yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

The assailants hit him in the face, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives were gathering video of the area and looking for witnesses.

“Empire,” a hip-hop musical drama series, premiered on Fox Television in 2015 and has been nominated for Grammy and Golden Globe awards. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Smollett’s colleagues said they were shocked by the attack.

“I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett,” Empire co-creator Danny Strong said on Twitter. “He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live.”

Chicago Police said in a statement that the department was investigating a “possible racially charged assault and battery” involving an “Empire” cast member, but didn’t name Smollett.

According to TMZ, Smollett arrived in Chicago late Monday and went to a Subway for something to eat early on Tuesday morning. As he was leaving the restaurant, two men approached him and one yelled, “Aren’t you that f—– Empire n—–?,” sources connected to Smollett told TMZ.

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett was hospitalized Tuesday in Chicago after he was targeted by two attackers who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him and tied a rope around his neck.

The incident is being investigated by the Chicago Police Department as a possible hate crime, chief spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

Smollett, 36, was walking in the city early Tuesday when he was approached by his attackers, who earned his attention by shouting racial and homophobic slurs in his direction.

The pair then beat up the actor with their hands, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene.

Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital, and is currently in good condition.

The attackers then began to “batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.” Later, one of the assailants “wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

Smollett is currently at Northwestern Hospital having checked himself in and is reportedly in good condition.

GLAAD, the world’s leading LGBTQ media organization, released a statement on the incident, saying, “GLAAD reached out to Fox and Jussie’s team today to offer assistance as well as support for him. Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

Smollett was in Chicago for a concert at the Troubador Hotel, in which he was set to perform.

Smollett came out as gay during a televised interview with Ellen DeGeneres in March 2015. “There is without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in, and I just wanted to make that clear,” Smollett told DeGeneres at the time. “I’ve told Ellen, now who else do I need to tell?”

Smollett is best known for his groundbreaking role as Jamal Lyon in Fox’s music industry family drama “Empire,” created by Lee Daniels and in which he stars opposite Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard. The character is a gay singer and songwriter, who faces challenges from his family for coming out of the closet. He began his career as a child actor, starring in “The Mighty Ducks” and Rob Reiner’s “North.” He is the brother of actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell.

Chicago — A cast member on the hit television show “Empire” alleged he was physically attacked by men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs, police said Tuesday.

Police did not release the actor’s name but a statement from Fox, which airs “Empire,” identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36, who plays Jamal Lyon on the show. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime.

According to a police statement, Smollett was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an “unknown substance” on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the two men, who were wearing masks, fled the scene. Authorities have not identified any suspects, and Guglielmi said detectives are gathering security footage from nearby buildings and trying to find witnesses.

Smollett was able to take himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, police said. He was last reported in good condition.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Tuesday in support of Smollett. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence,” the statement read.

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels also voiced his support for Smollett in an Instagram video.

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” Daniels said. “You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.”

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

“He is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I’ve ever met,” Harris said Tuesday, adding that she’s still learning more details about the incident.

Smollett’s role as the gay son of a record company mogul in the drama propelled him to fame after it debuted four years ago. Smollett, who is gay, has been active in LBGTQ issues. He also released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

“Empire” is shot in Chicago and a Fox spokeswoman said the program is currently in production.

Associated Press writer Elana Schor contributed to this report from Washington.

In a statement released by the Chicago PD to the Hollywood Reporter and the Huffington Post, police said they are investigating the incident as a battery and a possible hate crime.

According to the statement, Smollett was ambushed outside of a Chicago restaurant by two unidentified suspects who approached him yelling homophobic and racist slurs.

Police also said that Smollett is fully cooperating with the investigation, and that they are “currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.” The suspects have not yet been identified or apprehended.

TMZ was the first to report the news of Smollett’s attack, alleging several more unconfirmed details of what happened.

Smollett, who is openly gay, also plays a queer character on Empire, Jamal Lyon.

The queer rights group GLAAD said it has contacted Smollett to offer its assistance, noting to the Hollywood Reporter that “Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

Empire co-creator Danny Strong condemned the attack and tweeted his support of Smollett.

Fox, which airs Empire, issued a statement to the Hollywood Reporter that included support for Smollett and a vow to see justice done: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

""Empire"" creator Lee Daniels, Kerry Washington, Viola Davis and LGBTQ icon George Takei were among those condemning the hateful attack.

Many celebrities are outraged after ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett was reportedly attacked in a hate crime in Chicago on Monday.

According to TMZ, the actor was beat up by two men around 2 a.m. when he went to get some food at Subway. When he left the restaurant, the assailants reportedly yelled, ""Aren't you that f---ot 'Empire' n----?""

The males, who are both said to have been white and wearing ski masks, attacked Smollett, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him. The attack was so brutal that Smollett is said to have fractured a rib. The men reportedly yelled ""This is MAGA country"" as they left the scene. Smollett is believed to have been treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and discharged Tuesday morning.

ThatGrapeJuice.Net also reported that a letter was sent to Fox Studios in Chicago, where ""Empire"" is currently filming its fifth season. The letter features cut out letters that read, ""You will die black f--.""

The disturbing incident soon went viral on Twitter Tuesday morning and people began to react to the horrifying news. This post will continue to be updated as more messages come in.

Jussie's ""Empire"" costar Terrence Howard spoke about the incident on ""GMA"" Wednesday. ""I heard he's getting better. You know, he's angry. But I know Jussie. Jussie's anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did,"" he said. ""But he won't, and we cannot, forget their actions.""

""They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance,"" he continued. ""Jussie's the one that starts singing when everybody's in a bad mood. He's the one that cheers everybody up. He's the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family, you know, the Fox family, the 'Empire' family, the Lyon family, were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.""

Taraji P. Henson also posted on Instagram, writing, ""I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn't and we all feel his pain right now. @jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!!""

""My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know,"" she continued. ""TThe love so many have him just goes to show HE IS LOVE!!!! No matter how the press tries to spin the shit. I LOVE YOU MY BABY MY BABY!!! #LOVEWINSALWAYS. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💋💋💋""

Zachary Quinto revealed he saw Jussie hours before the attack, for a reading on ""Take Me Out,"" a play about a baseball player who comes out as gay. ""When it was over I was pondering the impact of this play which was written seventeen years ago and there was a part of me that actually wondered if it was still as relevant in the current sociopolitical climate considering 'how far we've come,'"" wrote Quinto. ""And then I read about what happened to Jussie last night in Chicago - less than twelve hours after we finished the reading - and I was utterly floored on so many levels. I was absolutely enraged by the injustice and the senselessness of such violence, but I was also vividly reminded that we MUST continue our fight for equality and acceptance at every turn in this country and in this world. When talented and courageous young men like Jussie are targeted and struck down in our streets - we must collectively RISE UP against such hatred and be IDENTIFIED and be PROUD and be STRONG in our convictions of truth and self-love and love for one another.""

Kevin Hart, who was recently the subject of controversy over homophobic jokes, sent his ""prayers"" to Jussie as well. ""This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards....this is disgusting,"" he wrote. ""We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people....Choose love...I repeat...Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.""

On Wednesday, ""Black Panther"" star Chadwick Boseman tweeted, ""Praying for you, brother. @ Jussie Smollett your light is so much stronger than their hate.""

""Star Trek"" icon George Takei was among those who responded to the news, writing: ""This is horrific. What kind of country do we live in?""

""Empire"" EP Danny Strong was ""deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks"" and showed support for Smollett on Twitter as well.

""Black-ish"" star Yara Shahidi took to Instagram and posted a photo of Smollett along with the caption: ""You can never dim someone who is the manifestation of light. Sending love to the brilliant human/ artists/ and humanitarian @jussiesmollett ❤️I'm at a loss for words, but one thing I know for certain is an act of hate against you, is an act of hate against all of us. We will continue to stand with you ❤️.""

Actress and LGBTQ activist Lena Waithe tweeted that her ""heart is broken"" over the news and ""Scandal"" star Kerry Washington wrote, ""DEAR GOD! Prayers and justice for Jussie Smollett.""

""The Talk"" hosts reacted to the news on their show Tuesday afternoon. ""This is so sad,"" Eve said. ""It's crazy because to me this is domestic terrorism... We're terrorizing our own people with this hatred. This is ridiculous...it's so sad it makes you sick.""

""You know and it's just such a wake-up call,"" co-host Sara Gilbert added. ""I know we see stories like this all the time, but you do fool yourself that you're safe in our world. You get in your own bubble, around your friends...it's just a shocking, horrible reminder that any of us can be a victim of this kind of hate. We send our love and prayers that you heal quickly, Jussie and we hope you're well.""

U.S. Senator Kamala Harris tweeted, ""@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I'm praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.""

Tyler Perry wrote on Instagram: ""This may be a waste of time because I have learned that it's often pointless to try and reach people who are hell bent on living in darkness, but here goes. To hate someone because of their race or sexuality is a shining reflection of who you are. To buy into the fear and the racist hatred that is being handed out daily by some of our politicians speaks to the ability of your very simple and small mind to be easily manipulated. To attack a defenseless person shows how much of a coward and how truly weak you really are. But as my grandmother always said when someone did something awful and evil, ""I promise you, you will reap what you sow."" My tears and prayers are with the gentle, beautiful soul that is @jussiesmollett. I'm standing with you my friend and anyone else who is bullied and battered and marginalized because of the BEAUTY OF WHO THEY ARE. I love you and your family. Get well soon.""

20th Century Fox posted a statement to ""Empire's"" official Instagram page. ""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our 'Empire' family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,"" the statement read. ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate -- and especially against one of our own.""

Smollett publicly came out as gay on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" back in March 2015.

(Reuters) - Chicago police said on Tuesday they were investigating an assault on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett as a possible hate crime after two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs and wrapped a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was reported to be in good condition after taking himself to a hospital after the incident early on Tuesday, police said.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Chicago police said in a statement.

Police did not identify Smollett by name, but gave his age and said he had a role on ""Empire."" The show's co-creator, Lee Daniels, and representatives from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment confirmed he was the victim.

""We have to love each other, regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united,"" Daniels said in a profanity-laced video on his Instagram account.

""Hold your head up Jussie,"" Lee added.

The two unknown assailants, police said, approached Smollett on the street about 2 a.m. CST and began a ""possible racially motivated"" attack, yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

The assailants hit him in the face, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives were gathering video of the area and looking for witnesses.

A representative for Smollett did not respond to requests for comment.

""Empire,"" a hip-hop musical drama series, premiered on Fox Television in 2015. Its lead actress, Taraji P. Henson, won a Golden Globe Award in 2016 for her role and the show has received multiple Emmy Award nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Smollett's colleagues said they were shocked.

""The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,"" Empire co-creator Danny Strong said on Twitter.

Raquel Willis, an African-American transgender rights activist and executive editor of Out magazine, a lifestyle publication that centers on the LGBT community, condemned the attack on Twitter.

""The hate that fuels white supremacy is the same hate that fuels homophobia,"" Willis said. ""A conscientious society realizes it's at war with both.""

Police are reportedly investigating the attack as a hate crime that took place near a Subway sandwich shop, where two men are said to have confronted Smollett at around 2:00 am. TMZ first reported the story with disturbing details, many of which have been confirmed (via the Chicago Police Department) by Variety:

According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, Smollett was beaten by two men who approached him by yelling out “racial and homophobic slurs” at approximately 2 a.m. Tuesday morning in the 300 block of E. North Water Street. They proceeded to assault Smollett and “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him. The two men are also said to have put a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing on foot.

TMZ reported that the chemical substance used by the men was bleach and that they shouted, “This is MAGA country!” Those particular details haven’t yet been confirmed by the Chicago PD (and the Daily Beast says the PD has no record of that quote), although it was also reported that Smollett was allegedly the recipient of a death threat last week.

Following the attack, Smollett transported himself to a nearby hospital. He has since been discharged in “good condition,” according to the Chicago PD. On Monday night, Smollett Instagrammed about arriving on a flight from NYC to Chicago, where he was due to perform on Saturday and where he films FOX’s Empire. On the show, the openly gay actor plays Jamal Lyon, a gay character who’s part of the musical family dynasty.

Deadline reports a statement from GLAAD about the attack. “GLAAD reached out to FOX and Jussie’s team today to offer assistance as well as support for him,” said the association. “Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

Empire executive producer Danny Strong has stated that he’s “deeply horrified and saddened” while condemning the attack on Smollett.

I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett. He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live… — Danny Strong (@Dannystrong) January 29, 2019

…whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come. — Danny Strong (@Dannystrong) January 29, 2019

UPDATE #1 – 2:43pm EST: FOX has issued a statement in support of Smollett via Twitter:

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

There’s some horrible news coming out this morning related to Empire star Jussie Smollett following an incident in Chicago.

According to a new report from TMZ, the actor arrived in Chicago from New York late overnight, and following that went to a Subway for a quick meal. (Empire is set in New York, but actually films in Chicago.) Upon leaving the restaurant he was apparently attacked by two men wearing ski masks and shouting homophobic and racist slurs at him. They allegedly proclaimed “this is MAGA country” and at one point, a rope was put around his neck and bleach was poured on him. It’s a horrific report of a brutal incident, one that never should have happened. Smollett was hospitalized and then released and seems to be in okay condition physically.

In a statement today, the Chicago Police Department makes it clear that an investigation is underway:

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime … Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.”

There is a chance that the attack was premeditated, as a report from That Grape Juice notes that Smollett was previously sent a threatening letter, one that included a drawing of him getting shot. Smollett plays a gay character named Jamal Lyon on the series, one who has been mistreated and tormented by other characters over time because of his sexuality.

We’re sure that Jussie will have the support of his entire Empire family as he works to recover from this incident along with all of his family and fans. Executive producer Danny Strong has already put out the following message via social media:

I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against [Smollett]. He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live… whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate-filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.

This is still a developing story, and we imagine there will be more updates down the road. The most important thing is that Smollett is okay, and our heart goes out to him. No one should have to go through what he has and we hope those responsible for this despicable attack are brought to justice. (Photo: Fox.)

Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on Fox's drama Empire, appears to have been the target of a possible hate crime.

TMZ reports that Smollett traveled from New York to Chicago on Monday, Jan. 28, 2019, and, around 2 a.m., he reportedly went to grab a bite to eat at a local Subway. Sources close to Smollett told the gossip rag that, when the actor left, two white men wearing ski masks attacked him, after someone first reportedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs. They then were said to have ""beat him badly and fractured a rib."" According to TMZ, the two assailants also poured bleach on Smollett and put a noose around his neck. Before they left the scene, they reportedly said, ""This is MAGA country.""

Smollett was admitted to Northwestern Memorial, and he was discharged Tuesday morning. According to a statement from the Chicago police that was obtained by HuffPost editor Philip Lewis, the victim of the attack — who was not identified as Smollett but as a ""36-year-old man"" who is a ""cast member of the television show Empire"" — is in ""good condition.""

Chicago police are reportedly investigating the attack. ""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" authorities said in a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter.

As noted by THR, Smollett's character on Empire is gay, and Smollett has identified as gay, though, as he told comedian Ellen DeGeneres, he doesn't like discussing his personal life.

Smollett had traveled to Chicago for a performance on Saturday, Feb. 2. Before the attack, he'd posted on Instagram that he'd landed in the city, stating that he'd been on a seven-hour flight that was originally only supposed to take two hours."

As authorities investigate this possible hate crime, get to know all about Jussie.

UPDATE 3 (3/26/19), 11:35 AM EST: The charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett — over allegedly staging a racial attack against himself in Chicago on January 29 — have all been dropped, his Chicago-based attorney Ronald Safer confirms to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued the following statement (on March 26, 2019 at 1:15 PM EST) in wake of this development: “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”

UPDATE 2: Jussie was arrested on February 20 on felony charges of filing a false police report and disorderly conduct. Chicago police gave a press conference the following day and confirmed that he faked his own attack because he was “dissatisfied” with his Empire salary.

UPDATE: On Jan. 30 the Chicago Police Department tweeted out “Hours ago # ChicagoPolice detectives located a surveillance camera that shows potential persons of interest wanted for questioning in reference to the assault & battery of Empire actor. A community alert w/ photos is being constructed and will be disseminated shortly.” We will keep you undated on the breaking developments.

In the early hours of Jan. 29, Empire star Jussie Smollett, 36, was brutally attacked outside a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago. “Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department told HollywoodLife.com in a statement. The attackers allegedly shouted, “This is MAGA country,” while putting a rope around his neck. After the offenders fled the scene, Jussie went to Northwestern Hospital. Thankfully, the authorities say he’s “in good condition,” as this brutal attack could have turned deadly.

The “severity” of the allegations has the authorities looking into this attack as a hate crime. There are also reports that Fox Studios in Chicago received a death threat a week before the attack. As the details come to light, get the facts about Jussie.

1. He’s been acting for nearly three decades. Born in Santa Rosa, California, Jussie began his acting career as a child, first appearing in 1991’s A Little Piece of Heaven. He gained fame the next year by appearing in The Mighty Ducks. He also landed a role in 1994’s North. In 1994, he starred alongside his five real-life siblings in ABC’s short-lived sitcom, On Our Own, while also voicing the character Mike on the animated show, Cro.

2. …but he’s best known as Jamal Lyon. Following these brushes with success, Jussie struggled to figure out what to do with himself. “Even when I got out of the business, my family was still in the business,” he told Out magazine in 2016. He booked a few guest roles on The Mindy Project and Revenge, but his breakout came in 2015 when he landed the role of Jamal Lyon on Empire. His portrayal of the character – the openly gay son of Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) Lyon who struggles to win his father’s approval – earned him critical acclaim.

3. He landed the role thanks (partially) to his family. “I read the script and I automatically fell in love with Jamal,” Jussie told Collider in 2015. “The way that it happened was that my brothers, my sisters and I text message each other, all the time, and we have group text message threads. My older sister, who’s a producer, sent the link on the thread about Lee Daniels and Danny Strong doing this show.”

“I immediately went on Instagram and I direct messaged Lee Daniels, who I had never met. I said, ‘I know that you get this all the time, but I’m a singer/actor/songwriter/dancer. I am Jamal Lyon, in more ways than one.” I don’t even know why I jumped on and did that, but I did. It was one of those things you do, where you have no expectations. But, he wrote me back and said, “Casting will be in touch.” By the time that he wrote me back, I already had an audition the very next day,” he said. And the rest is history.

4. He came out as gay in 2015. “There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” Jussie said during a March 2015 episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. After performing “Good Enough” and his version of “You’re So Beautiful,” he came out as gay. He made it clear in the 2016 conversation with Out. “What I’m saying is, I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I don’t know how many times I have to say that.”

5. Jussie’s also a musician. This should be no surprise since he performed both on Empire and on the aforementioned Ellen episode. But, yes — one of his first loves is music. “I dropped an EP called the Poisoned Heart Club with four-five songs around 2011,” he told Fader in 2018 ahead of the release of his full-length project, Sum of my Music. “I had to take it down when I booked Empire, so this is definitely my first full body of work…. Making this album has been my everything. It’s what I’ve been doing privately and quietly for years, for it to out there…I’m grateful. I’m a little anxious, maybe a bit scared, but it’s very special to me.”"

Others took the moment to throw criticism at 'gay jokes' and Kevin Hart's recent appearance on Ellen where he addressed the controversy surrounding his hosting the Oscars.

Actor Ryan Jamaal Swain stated: 'This is why holding ""a little homophobic joke'""accountable is taken so FREAKING SERIOUSLY. To quote @amandaseales, you have to be overly confident...black gay men have to deal w/ not only racism but homophobia.' It is always abt duality and a form of respect. @JussieSmollett

'Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks,' said Saeed Jones. 'Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart.'"

The statement continues: “A 36 year old man was walking … when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him. The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

The statement adds that the victim transported himself to Northwestern Hospital and is in “good condition.”

A Chicago P.D. spokesperson tells PEOPLE that no arrests have been made and there are no solid suspects at this time. The officer says the attackers were wearing masks but will not confirm what they said, only that it was racially charged and homophobic. The victim thinks the liquid thrown on him was bleach, but detectives have yet to confirm that. He was by himself at the time of the attack.

Smollett’s reps did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face or any despicable act of violence and hatred — and especially against one of our own.”

TMZ reports that his attackers allegedly yelled, “This is MAGA country.” PEOPLE has not been able to independently confirm this.

The Blast obtained a recording of the dispatch call concerning the incident, in which the dispatcher says friends reported that Smollett “was assaulted when he walked out of his apartment.”

His next-door neighbor, Steven Down, says he was upset to hear what happened to Smollett. “He’s always been a very friendly, outgoing, warm and personable neighbor,” he tells PEOPLE. “I was shocked when I read the news. I did send my message to him personally but I haven’t heard from him or spoken with him. My thoughts are with him.”

Smollett, 35, first spoke publicly about being gay on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2015, though he said he never considered himself to be in the closet.

“There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he said, adding that deciding not to talk about his personal life is not an attempt to “hide or deny who God made me. There is, without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in,” he reiterated, “and I just wanted to make that clear.”

In a statement about the attack to The Hollywood Reporter, GLAAD said it reached out to Fox and Smollett’s team to offer assistance.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” the statement read.

And Eliza Byard, executive director of GLSEN, further spoke to his contributions to the gay community.

“It’s really awful. It’s shocking, it is deeply saddening. But unfortunately it is of a piece with trends we see in the country right now,’ Byard said. “My main concern at this moment is of course that Jussie have all the support to make a full recovery but that also LGBTQ youth across the country, particularly black LGBTQ youth know, that there is a community out there ready to support and protect them. Jussie is a member of our GLSEN family and he’s such an important figure for LGBTQ youth everywhere. I know him as a beacon for young people. The larger context here is that racism and homophobia are deep legacies that our society has to wrestle with and we have far to go.”"

That Grape Juice reports that Smollett recently received a piece of mail, in which the words “You will die black fag,” were spelled out using letters clipped from various sources and glued onto the page. Smollett came out on Ellen in 2015. In an interview with Out that that ran in 2016, he clarified: “If I had to label myself, I would label myself as a gay man. With that said, I believe that love is the only thing that matters, and I would hope that anybody would leave themselves open — not to gender, but to love....If I fall in love down the road with a woman, I’m going to love that woman.”

TMZ reports that Smollett has already been released from the hospital. The Chicago PD asks anyone with information to contact Area Central Detectives (312 747-8382) or report it anonymously using the Chicago PD’s TipSubmit website.

Update (1:07 pm ET): TMZ has added some details of the attack to its reporting:"

The actor reportedly went to a Subway restaurant near where he was staying around 2:00 a.m. when two men, both white and wearing ski masks, yelled at Smollett, saying, “Aren’t you that f*gg*t ‘Empire’ n*gg*r?” Both assailants then attacked Smollett.

In the course of the fight, Smollett suffered a broken rib and many other contusions. They also poured a chemical substance, believed to be bleach, on the actor.

Prior to the assailants leaving the scene, they wrapped a noose around Smollett’s neck.

Smollett refused to be transported via ambulance, checking himself into Northwestern Hospital after the attack. He is listed in good condition.

Smollett is a New Yorker, but resides in Chicago during the filming of Empire.

Fans and Celebs React

As details of Smollett’s assault spread across the internet, fans and celebrities shared their opinions on the incident and their support for the actor/musician.

The attack on Jussie Smollett was allegedly by MAGA white supremacists. This is exactly why we need to be defending ALL Black people. These people don’t care if you’re a woman, LGBTQ, or heterosexual. They want us dead. We can’t let anyone force us against ourselves. — Frederick Joseph (@FredTJoseph) January 29, 2019

Anyone trying to ignore the fact that Jussie Smollett is BOTH Black & gay need to sit down. This was a racially-motivated homophobic attack. They called him racial slurs AND homophobic ones. He carries BOTH identities and white supremacists made it a point to target both. — Ernest Owens (@MrErnestOwens) January 29, 2019

Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks. Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart. — Saeed Jones (@theferocity) January 29, 2019

Jan. 29 (UPI) -- Empire star Jussie Smollett was hospitalized after being targeted in an apparent hate crime.

Entertainment Tonight confirmed Tuesday the 35-year-old actor is recovering after being attacked in what appeared to be a homophobic and racially-charged incident in Chicago.

The Chicago Police Department said the victim was walking when two unknown men approached and shouted racial and homophobic slurs. The offenders allegedly attacked the victim about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance onto him.

Police said the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck at one point during the incident before ultimately fleeing the scene. The victim took himself to Northwestern Hospital and is in good condition.

""Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire,"" department rep Anthony Gulielmi said in a statement.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline,"" he added.

Variety said the alleged attack took place at around 2 a.m. Tuesday morning. Smollett arrived in Chicago Monday, according to an Instagram post, and was slated to perform in the city Saturday.

Smollett plays Jamal Lyon on Empire, which returned for a fifth season on Fox in September. He publicly came out as gay during an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show in March 2015."

Actor Jussie Smollett, who stars as middle son Jamal Lyon on Fox’s Empire, is in good condition at a Chicago hospital today after being attacked by two men in the city’s Loop area around 2 a.m. last night. Smollett was reportedly exiting a Subway restaurant when he was approached by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs who began battering Smollett and poured bleach on him. They then wrapped a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene, as The Chicago Tribune reports. Smollett then took himself to the hospital.

In a statement, the Chicago Police Department says, “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.” (You think?) It’s unclear at this time whether Smollett was specifically targeted for the attack, but he is openly gay, telling Ellen DeGeneres in 2015, “There is no closet, there’s never been a closet that I’ve been in.”

GLAAD has released a statement saying it has reached out to Fox and Smollett’s team offering assistance, calling him “a true champion for LGBTQ people [who] is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

UPDATE/CORRECTION, 12:30 p.m. CT: TMZ has additional details indicating that Smollett was, indeed, specifically targeted by his attackers. The site says that the men were wearing ski masks, not MAGA hats, but that they said, “aren’t you that f***** Empire n*****?,” as they approached Smollett, and reportedly yelled, “this is MAGA country!,” as they fled the scene. Smollett has reportedly also been the target of hate mail sent to Fox Studios in Chicago, some containing death threats, for at least the past week. (Chicago police have not confirmed the details of TMZ’s report.)

Smollett was discharged from the hospital earlier today.

UPDATE, 1:00 p.m. CT: In a statement, Fox says of the hate crime against Smollett:

We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stand united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.

They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What's the most political thing that's ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker's fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan's vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme.

Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers.

Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick's childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he's ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence.

BBC 8/10 3) Killing Eve It's unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it's simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country's outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings' novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.

No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. Rex Features 10/10 1) Succession The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too.

The actor, who came out as gay in 2015, was beaten by two men who yelled “racial and homophobic slurs” around 2 a.m., according to a Chicago Police Department statement.

The men proceeded to “batter the victim with their hands” and then poured an “unknown chemical substance” on Smollett. The men then tied a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene.

Smollett took himself to an area hospital, where he was described as being in “good condition.”

Chicago PD is treating the attack — which they described as potentially being a “possible racially-charged assault and battery” — as a potential hate crime.

Smollett was visiting the city for a concert this weekend. He reached Chicago late Monday night, and reportedly went to a Subway for food, according to TMZ.

The gossip site claims that the men who attacked Smollett screamed “This is MAGA country” while attacking Smollett, yelled “Aren’t you that faggot Empire n****r?”, and that the substance poured on Smollett was bleach — though those reports are unverified.

GLAAD released a statement after news broke about the attack, saying they had reached out to Fox and Smollett’s team to “offer assistance as well as support for him.”

They added: “Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

Smollett came out publicly in 2015 during an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, telling DeGeneres that there’s “never been a closet that I’ve been in.”

He added that his decision not to disclose his sexuality up to that point wasn’t an attempt to “hide or deny who God made me. There is, without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in…and I just wanted to make that clear.”

Speaking to Metro Weekly last year, Smollett gave a fiery sermon on the state of the nation in Trump’s America.

“As Americans, we give ourselves way too much credit,” he said. “We lie to ourselves about how wonderful we are, when we are not. We are great people. We are fierce, forceful, forthright, good people at our cores, but this country has not reflected that. What we have to remember is we had eight years of Obama, of feeling inspired, of feeling like somehow things were going to be okay, but during that period, we lost our ability to fight. We got comfortable, we got complacent. That’s why we’re in the situation that we’re in right now.

“Let us remember that Obama, for this country, is the anomaly,” he continued. “Trump is actually not such a huge misrepresentation of what our country in fact is. He’s what our country was built on — lies, deceit, thievery, let’s be honest…. This country is fucked up. It is. Point blank. Period. There’s no getting around it. We’ve got to clean it up.”"

The actor was brutally attacked by two men in the early hours of Tuesday morning, according to multiple reports.

Per TMZ, the two men in question ambushed the star as he walked out of Subway in Chicago at around 2 AM.

""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" one of the men supposedly yelled at the 35-year-old.

The attackers are said to be white and were allegedly wearing ski masks as they started to attack him.

The men are said to have put a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him, and fractured one of his ribs.

As the men left the scene of the crime, they apparently yelled, ""This is MAGA country.""

Smollett was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and was discharged early on Tuesday morning.

Smollett had only returned Chicago hours before the attack occurred. It is said that he got a flight from New York.

ThatGrapeJuice.Net is reporting that Jussie first received a horrifying threat through the post.

Have a look at the photo below.

This is a heinous crime, and given the above threat, it certainly seems like the attack was premeditated.

We’re told when he walked out, someone yelled, “Aren’t you that f****t ‘Empire’ n****r?” The two men — both white and wearing ski masks — viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib.

In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett said his attackers yelled ""MAGA country"" during the assault, Chicago police confirmed to CBS News.

As of Tuesday evening, police said they had yet to find surveillance video that showed the crime. ""Thus far, no video of the alleged assailants or a vehicle has been discovered but we are continuing to broaden our search,"" Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.

TMZ first reported details of the attack.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Guglielmi said in a statement.

The victim went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Guglielmi said the man was being treated at the hospital and is in good condition. The statement said the victim is cooperating fully with investigators.

Fellow members of the television industry, fans and advocates including the NAACP, GLAAD and the Anti-Violence project took to social media Tuesday to condemn the alleged assault.

NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson said in a statement the group is ""beyond troubled to hear about the recent racist and homophobic fueled attack on NAACP Image Award winner, acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett."" GLAAD called for the incident to be investigated thoroughly.

""Empire"" co-creator Danny Strong said he was ""deeply saddened and horrified"" by the incident.

""Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come,"" Strong tweeted.

FBI data released last year showed a 17 percent increase in hate crimes between 2016 and 2017. Hate crimes based on race, ethnicity or ancestry were the most common, making up about 60 percent of the total. The FBI's latest report also found 15.8 percent of hate crime offenses in 2017 stemmed from sexual orientation bias. Between 2016 and 2017, hate crimes motivated by racial bias rose about 18 percent and attacks on LGBTQ individuals rose 5 percent, according to the FBI.

The Anti-Violence project notes the severity of hate violence against LGBTQ people is increasing, with 46 percent of LGBTQ hate violence victims sustaining an injury in 2017 compared with 31 percent in 2016.

Chicago Police said they're continuing to seek evidence and video in the case to identify possible offenders. So far, police haven't developed information to be able to put out a suspect description, Guglielmi tweeted Tuesday afternoon.

He has now been the target of a vicious hate crime that appears to have been motivated both by his race and sexuality.

His assailants hurled slurs at him, poured bleach on him, and put his neck in a noose, yelling ""This is MAGA country.""

Shortly after midnight on Tuesday morning, Smollett updated fans that he had arrived in Chicago just in time for obscenely cold weather.

""#Mood after spending 7 hours on a plane for a 2 hour flight but finally landing all good,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""Love y’all. Goodnight.""

TMZ reports that it was not long after this that Jussie, hungry after his flight, went to Subway to grab a quick bite to eat.

When he emerged from the fast food establishment, two men approached him, and that's when things got terrifying.

One of them reportedly yelled: ""Aren't you that f----t 'Empire' n-----?""

Those slurs are too vile to print, but one is homophobic and the other is racial in nature.

Both white men were wearing ski masks. These two unidentified assailants then viciously attacked Jussie.

Though he attempted to fight back, they beat him severely and fractured one of his ribs.

Unfortunately, this outrageous assault was not the end of it.

The two men then slipped a noose around Jussie's neck and then poured bleach on him.

As they departed, both men are said to have yelled: ""This is MAGA country.""

Jussie was transported to Northwestern Memorial, where he received treatment. He was discharged later on Tuesday.

TMZ reports that police are investigating the attack as battery. They are also looking at this assault as a possible hate crime.

The slurs used seem to indicate that.

Additionally, the noose is a chilling symbol of anti-black hate crimes, referring to countless lynchings.

The pouring of bleach also seems to have been, in addition to a chemical attack, a reference to the color of Jussie's skin.

The Chicago Police Department released a statement on Jussie's assault.

""Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a possible report of a racially-charged assault and battery,"" the statement begins.""

""Given the severity of the allegations,"" the statement continues. ""We are taking this investigation very seriously.""

""And,"" the CPD says. ""Treating it as a possible hate crime.""

""Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses, and establish an investigative timeline,"" the statement shares.

Notably, the official police report refers to the bleach as an ""unknown chemical substance.""

It will likely be up to the crime lab to confirm that the chemical used in the attack was bleach.

That Grape Juice reports that Jussie received a hateful warning letter just 8 days prior to the monstrous attack.

The letter, scrawled in marker and sent to Fox Studios in Chicago, featured a crude drawing depicting a lynching.

Using cut-out letters, the message read: ""You will die black f--,"" again using a homophobic slur.

The letter was addressed to Jussie by name.

Actors, particularly marginalized actors, may receive threats like this all of the time.

Very few menacing threats are followed up.

Hopefully, police will be able to find witnesses and CCTV footage that will expose the monsters who perpetrated this attack.

It is unclear if the assailants are the same individuals who sent the warning letter.

Sadly, it could be a coincidence -- there is nothing unique about someone scrawling ""MAGA"" and threatening to lynch a black man.

It is our hope that the perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice.

We hope that Jussie is recovering well.

Update: TMZ reported additional follow-ups on Tuesday.

The production of Empire held a staff meeting to personally inform everyone involved with the series about the assault on Jussie.

The rest of the cast will have armed security for the duration of production in Chicago.

As for the threatening letter, apparently the FBI was already looking into the death threat.

Additionally, within 12 hours of the assault, Chicago police were already canvassing the area for CCTV footage that might help.

The police were specifically said to have visited a Target and an apartment building.

Lee Daniels, the creator of Empire, took to social media to share a heartfelt video expressing his outrage over the attack."

Jussie Smollett, 36, had reportedly arrived in Chicago from New York City late Monday and ventured out to get something to eat, according to TMZ.

The Chicago Police Department said in a statement that two unknown men approached Smollett and got his attention by shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

“The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” Chicago Police said. “At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital and is reportedly in good condition.

Police say they’re treating the incident as a possible hate crime and are urging potential witnesses to come forward as they try to establish an investigative timeline.

Smollett has been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, which in turn has attracted the attention of some of the president’s far-right supporters.

Two years ago, he released a track titled “F.U.W.” (acronym for “Fucked Up World”) and a music video, to coincide with President’s Day in 2017. The video featured imagery about racial justice, and showed a man in a wheelchair rolling over a Trump mask, in an apparent comment on the president mocking a disabled reporter during the 2016 campaign.

On Monday night, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the show Empire, who was later reported to be Smollett by both TMZ and Empire writer/director Eric Haywood.

According to the police report, the Empire cast member was attacked by two unknown offenders who were yelling out racial and homophobic slurs. During the encounter, the assailants battered the victim, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and proceeded wrap a rope around his neck.

The offenders later fled the scene, with the victim then transporting himself to Northwestern Hospital, where he is reported to be in good condition.

In a statement, Chicago PD said, “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.”

“The victim is fully cooperating with investigators,” the statement continued. “And we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to cpdtip.com.”

Although Chicago PD did not officially identify Smollett as the victim, Haywood took to Twitter to express his anger at the situation.

“I will burn your f***ing house down to protect @JussieSmollett,” he wrote. “Write that s*** down.”



According to ThatGrapeJuice.Net, this violent attack comes just days after Smollett received a threatening letter, which read “You will die black f*g.”

“There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he said.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

According to a statement from the Chicago Police Department obtained by Billboard, the 36 year-old actor was leaving a restaurant around 2:00 a.m. when two unnamed suspects began yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him. ""The Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire,"" reads the statement. ""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.""

The suspects --- who had not been arrested at press time -- then reportedly attacked Smollett, punching him in the face and pouring an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him, according to police, who said that at some point during the attack one suspect wrapped a rope around Smollett's neck. The two suspects fled the scene and Smollet transported himself to Northwestern Hospital where he is reported to be in good condition.

Detectives are currently working to gather video of the incident and identify potential witnesses. Smollett is cooperating with the investigation and police ask anyone with information to contact Area Central Detectives at (312) 747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com. Smollett plays gay singer/songwriter Jamal Lyon on Empire.

A Chicago Police department spokesperson confirmed that the assailant's faces were concealed, according to Smollett. The Chicago PD did not confirm, however, a TMZ report that claimed the two men attacked Smollett as he was leaving a Subway restaurant after arriving in Chicago on a late from New York, shouting, ""Aren't you that faggot Empire n----r?"" The site described the alleged attackers as white men wearing ski masks to conceal their faces, who attacked Smollett as he fought back -- sustaining a fractured rib in the process -- yelling ""This is MAGA country"" as they fled the scene.

20th Century Fox Televsion and Fox Entertainment released a statement about the incident, which read: ""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, GLAAD said it had reached out to Smollett's team and Fox with an offer of help. ""Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,"" the statement said.

Our hearts are with @JussieSmollett today. This attack must be investigated thoroughly. According to @antiviolence, the severity of hate violence against LGBTQ people is increasing: https://t.co/hN0yNJEmov https://t.co/acWmjzBBzW — GLAAD (@glaad) January 29, 2019

Smollett has not commented on the reported attack yet, but he received well wishes from a number of fellow stars, including Zendaya, Amanda Seales, Billy Eichner and Empire co-creator Lee Daniels, who called Smollett his ""son"" in a video reaction. ""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around you neck. To have bleach thrown on you. To be called die faggot, nigger, or whatever they said to you. You are better than that, we are better than that. America is better than that,"" he said. ""We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows that we are united, on a united front. And no racist fuck can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up Jessie, I'm with you I'll be there in a minute. It's just another fucking day in America.

Empire co-creator Danny Strong also issued a statement on the attack, which he said left him ""deeply horrified and saddened.""

Elsewhere, NAACP has weighed in on the attack and called out President Donald Trump’s “racist and xenophobic rhetoric.” ““The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling,” President and CEO Derrick Johnson said in a statement. “The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric. It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse.

SAG-AFTRA also issued a statement tonight: “Today’s reported attack on actor Jussie Smollett is a vicious and violent crime that cannot be tolerated. We have spoken with Mr. Smollett’s representatives and FOX executives to offer our support, and have sent a SAG-AFTRA representative to the Empire set to assist any of our members who may be in distress. We urge the Chicago authorities to move swiftly to identify, arrest and prosecute Mr. Smollett’s attackers and if applicable, to refer the case for prosecution under federal hate crime laws. We stand with Jussie Smollett, LGBTQ people and all marginalized communities in rejecting intolerance and brutality. An attack on one is an attack on all.”

Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement: “This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident. There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities — and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities. Last year alone, at least 26 transgender people, mostly transgender women of color, were brutally murdered. This is an unacceptable crisis, and HRC continues to press for improved reporting, passage of state laws that protect LGBTQ individuals from hate crimes, and expanded education and training initiatives.”

The attackers reportedly punched Smollett before pouring an unknown chemical substance over him. At some point during the attack, one of the suspects wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene. Early and unconfirmed press reports said the attackers shouted pro-MAGA statements. The police statement did not confirm that detail.

The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

In an Instagram post, Empire co-creator Lee Daniels said, “It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this, because Jussie, you are my son. You didn’t deserve, nor anyone deserves, to have a noose put around your neck; to have bleach thrown on you … you are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.” Co-creator Danny Strong, meanwhile, tweeted, “The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live … whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett. He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart.

Update, 7:22 p.m.: According to Chicago police spokesperson Michelle Tannehill, detectives spoke to Smollett this afternoon and the actor recalled that the suspects had said, “This is MAGA country now,” before they fled the scene. Detectives have now filed a supplemental report. Additionally, police confirmed to Vulture that the actor still had the rope around his neck when police arrived on the scene.

Update, 1/30 1:40 a.m.: Chicago police announced on Twitter that they have expanded their search area and are reviewing video footage in their search for suspects, but have had no luck so far.

Update 1/30, 6:40 p.m.: Authorities are looking into “potential persons of interest” in the attack on Smollett after a surveillance camera captured people potentially linked to the crime.

Update 1/30, 9:28pm: Variety is reporting that Smollett’s manager Brandon Z. Moore was on the phone with the actor when he was attacked. He confirmed Smollett’s account that the assailants yelled “MAGA country” during the attack. “I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,” he told Variety, though he refused to elaborate further due to the active investigation.

Update 1/30, 3:58pm: Smollet’s family put out a statement decrying the attack on him. “In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack,” it reads. “We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.” The statement continues:

Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.

The Chicago police, meanwhile, have said that Smollett had refused to give over his cell phone to the investigation to provide records of the call with his manager during the attack. “The detective are still investigating, but at this time he has refused to turn over the cell phone,” said Chicago police spokesperson Michelle Tannehill. Smollett has not explained why he doesn’t want to give police his phone, she said.

The Empire star, 36, was approached by two people who began “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him,” according to Guglielmi. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

The attackers fled the scene before Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He has since been released. Guglielmi tells Us that the actor is in “good condition,” and detectives are investigating the incident.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” the spokesman adds. “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators, and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com.”

According to ThatGrapeJuice.Net, which was first to report the news, Smollett received a threatening letter days before the incident that read, “You will die black f-g.”

The actor has starred as Jamal Lyon on Empire for five seasons. He has also appeared in The Mighty Ducks (1992) and Alien: Covenant (2017), and is the brother of actor Jake Smollett and actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell.

Jussie came out as gay during a 2015 interview with Ellen DeGeneres. “It was a bigger deal to everyone than it was for me,” he said. “But at the same time I do understand why it is something to talk about.”

Us Weekly has reached out to Jussie’s rep for comment.

""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called, 'die f-----, n-----, ' or whatever they said to you.

TMZ first reported the news about Smollett's assault and the Chicago Police later released a statement confirming a cast member on the Fox drama was beaten and hospitalized. (Chicago police did not mention Smollett by name.)

According to the police statement, two men approached the 36-year-old and ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him."" Per the police, the two men beat Smollett, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him (bleach, according to TMZ) and ""wrapped a rope around the victim's neck.""

The men, both of whom wore ski masks to cover their faces, allegedly shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Police have not confirmed those specific details and a Chicago Police spokesperson told The Daily Beast there was ""no report"" of MAGA taunts from the attackers.

Representatives for the Chicago police department did not respond to requests for comment.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. as the actor was getting food from a Subway sandwich location after arriving to Chicago from New York. The actor reportedly suffered a fractured rib and was transported to Northwestern Memorial for treatment before being released Tuesday morning. The assault follows the arrival of a threatening letter reportedly sent to Fox's Chicago studios last week which was addressed to Smollett and contained a threat to his life along with similar hateful slurs. Entertainment Tonight reports that as a result of the attack, Smollett and the rest of the Empire cast will have armed security as the production of the show continues.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the Chicago Police Department revealed that it is investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department, without naming Smollett in its statement, said a “cast member from the Fox series ‘Empire’ was injured in what police called a ‘possible racially-charged assault and battery.'” The assault took place in the Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago.

Police said Smollett, 36, was walking when two offenders started yelling the racist and homophobic slurs. The offenders then “began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” and one put a rope around his neck, according to police.

Smollett then drove himself to Northwestern Hospital, where he’s in good condition, a person with knowledge of the situation told TheWrap.

Late Tuesday, Chicago police officer Michelle Tannehill told TheWrap that Smollett did not initially mention the attackers shouting about MAGA — an abbreviation of President Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan — but did bring up “MAGA” in a follow-up interview.

“When detectives followed up later in the day, he recalled the attackers making those remarks,” Tannehill said. She said she could not be more specific.

Tannehill said there were no suspects as of Tuesday night, but that police were looking into charges of “possible racially charged assault and battery.”

The case has brought an outpouring of love for Smollett and widespread condemnation of the attack. Some online have objected to the word “possible,” saying the hateful element of such a crime is obvious. But Tannehill said police routinely use the word “possible” in cases when the an investigation is not yet complete.

Smollett told Ellen DeGeneres on her show in 2015 that “there is without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in, and I just wanted to make that clear.”

On “Empire,” he plays Jamal Lyon, a gay musician. Executive producer Danny Strong condemned the attack on Twitter on Tuesday, saying the “terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society.”

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has reported being assaulted in Chicago on Tuesday by two men hurling racial and homophobic slurs at him and wrapping a rope around his neck in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, officials said.

Smollett, 36, had just landed in town from New York and was out getting a bite to eat at about 2 a.m. CT (3 a.m. ET) on East North Lower Water Street, in the upscale neighborhood of Streeterville, is when two men attacked him, the actor told police.

Two ""unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" according to a statement from the Chicago Police Department. ""The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.""

The chemical is believed to be bleach, according to a source familiar with the investigation.

""At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck,"" the statement continued. ""The offenders fled the scene.""

In a recording obtained by emergency-services feed aggregator Broadcastify, a dispatcher repeated information she gleaned from Smollett's friend who called in the attack.

""He's supposed to be well-known, requesting a report and said a noose was placed over the friend's neck,"" the dispatcher relayed to first responders.

Smollett, who is black and gay, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment. The extent of his injuries was not immediately known.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. ""Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating.""

Late Tuesday Guglielmi said on Twitter that investigators have canvassed an expanded area and were continuing to search for video evidence. ""Thus far, no video of the alleged assailants or a vehicle has been discovered but we are continuing to broaden our search,"" he said.

In a subsequent statement he added that police have already reviewed a lot of video but that they are continuing to search for imagery that would help them identify suspects.

""The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras,"" Guglielmi said. ""As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders. Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect's vehicle to be able to share.""

Twentieth Century Fox Television issued a statement in support of the actor.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,"" according to a company statement.

""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Friends and co-workers of Smollett's in addition to gay-rights advocates also spoke out.

Actor, writer and ""Empire"" producer Danny Strong said in a tweet addressed to Smollett's attackers, ""do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.""

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation said in a statement: ""GLAAD reached out to FOX and Jussie’s team today to offer assistance as well as support for him. Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.""

NAACP President Derrick Johnson said that hate crimes are on the rise.

""The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling,"" he said in a statement,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""We pray for a full physical and mental recovery Jussie Smollett and many unnamed victims of this forum of hate based terrorism.”

On ""Empire,"" Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, the estranged son of his music-industry titan father played by Terrence Howard. Jamal is a gay singer-songwriter and his sexual orientation and career independence has him at odds with the family patriarch.

Smollett came out as gay in a backstage interview with Ellen DeGeneres in 2015, after ""Empire"" first aired on Fox.

Smollett appeared on MSNBC's ""PoliticsNation With Al Sharpton"" on Sunday to discuss the future of historically black colleges and universities. The actor has been active in fundraising efforts to save Bennett College in Greensboro, North Carolina."

Jussie's music project FUW released a music video critical of Trump in 2017 that went viral, and made him the target of online white supremacists. The video is below.

From TheGrio:

The black-and-white video features men and woman of various ethnicities and highlights injustices, from human and LGBT rights to religious and racial prejudices. A woman wears a hijab in one scene, a boy wears a hoodie in another and four women put their fists up as they stand in front of the words, “My body, my rights.”

“The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” Chicago Police told ITK in a statement.

Chicago investigators are searching for video of ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett getting brutally attacked outside of his apartment in hopes of tracking down the two suspects allegedly responsible.

The Blast obtained dispatch audio of Chicago officials ""canvassing"" the area for cameras near Smollett's apartment building. Investigators are looking for external cameras hanging off the sides of buildings, or any other video recording equipment that may have picked up the violent incident involving the actor.

One employee at Smollett's luxury high-rise apartment building tells The Blast cops were crawling all over the area Tuesday morning, and even tasked building management with trying to track down video. We're told, so far no video has been identified.

Sources familiar with the situation tell us Smollett has a car and usually drives in and out of the building's protected parking, and believed the actor was specifically targeted at a time he happened to be on foot.

As we reported, Smollett told cops the two suspects threw bleach in his face while yelling out racial and homophobic insults. There was also a noose allegedly placed around his neck. Smollett refused an ambulance, but transported himself to the hospital and was released in ""good condition.""

Police are currently investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

The two men are also said to have put a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing on foot. Smollett then transported himself to an area hospital and is described as being in “good condition.”

Smollett was in Chicago ahead of a concert he was set to perform on Saturday. He had posted on Instagram late Monday night saying he had arrived in the city “after spending 7 hours on a plane for a 2 hour flight.”

Reacting to the sad situation, GLAAD said, “GLAAD reached out to FOX and Jussie’s team today to offer assistance as well as support for him. Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

Jussie Smollett was hospitalized after an attack in Chicago late Monday night, according to TMZ. Two white men wearing ski masks approached Smollett, who is openly gay and plays a gay character on Empire, outside of a Subway, beat him up, called him “that f—got Empire n—,” put his head in a noose, and yelled, “This is MAGA country.” According to a statement from the Chicago Police, the men also “poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim” during the assault and later fled the scene. Smollett self-transported to Northwestern Memorial Hospital and is in “good condition.” Chicago police said they are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. ThatGrapeJuice.Net posted a photo of racist and homophobic hate mail Smollett previously received, implying that the attack may have been premeditated.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” 20th Century Fox TV and Fox Entertainment said in a statement. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

In an Instagram post, Empire co-creator Lee Daniels said, “It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this, because Jussie, you are my son. You didn’t deserve, nor anyone deserves, to have a noose put around your neck; to have bleach thrown on you … you are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.” Co-creator Danny Strong, meanwhile, tweeted, “The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live … whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, a talented singer whose character came out as gay to his father on the primetime drama. While fans have applauded the actor for his portrayal and openness about his own sexuality, two men reportedly attacked him over it.

According to TMZ, Smollett was heading to a Subway in Chicago on Monday night when the men, who were wearing ski masks, recognized him from “Empire” and used homophobic slurs before approaching him.

Although Smollett fought back, the men put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and shouted, “This is MAGA country.” The 36-year-old refused to be transported to the hospital and instead checked himself at a later time, according to The Blast. Smollett suffered a fractured rib and was discharged from Northwestern Memorial Hospital on Tuesday morning.

The Chicago Police Department released a statement about their investigation into the incident and will treat the attack as a possible hate crime. The suspects have not been caught as of Tuesday afternoon, but Smollett is said to be fully cooperating with authorities.

Empire star Jussie Smollett has been hospitalised in a suspected “racially-charged assault” in Chicago, during which he was subjected to homophobic slurs and had a chemical substance poured on him.

The 36-year-old actor, who came out as gay on The Ellen Degeneres Show in 2015, was attacked at approximately 2am in E. North Lower Water Street on Tuesday (January 29).

Detectives are treating the assault as a potential hate crime.

A Chicago Police Department spokesperson told PinkNews: “Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”

PinkNews understands Smollett was walking along when two people started shouting racial and homophobic slurs at him.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.” —Chicago Police Department spokesperson

The two assailants then punched the actor in the face, wrapped a rope around his neck, and poured a chemical substance on him.

The assault was first reported by entertainment website ThatGrapeJuice.

The Chicago Police Department spokesperson added: “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.

“The victim is fully cooperating with investigators and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com.”

Smollett is currently in a good condition at Northwestern Hospital in Chicago.

The actor is known for his portrayal of gay musician Jamal Lyon in the Fox drama series Empire. The character’s sexuality was in part inspired by the show’s creator, Lee Daniels.

Smollett began his career as a child actor, starring in The Mighty Ducks (1992) and North (1994).

Smollett has been outspoken about his character on Empire.

In November, he said he rejected a proposal from producers for Lyon to get a white boyfriend.

In an interview on SiriusXM’s The Clay Cane Show , the actor said:There was talk about Jamal having a white boyfriend and I said, ‘F**k no!’”

Smollett added: “Not for any reason except we have a responsibility and we have a such a beautiful opportunity to show two black men in a relationship together, in a healthy relationship.”"

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was reported to be in good condition after taking himself to a hospital after the incident early on Tuesday, police said.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police said in a statement.

Police did not identify Smollett by name, but gave his age and said he had a role on “Empire.” The show’s co-creator, Lee Daniels, and representatives from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment confirmed he was the victim.

“We have to love each other, regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united,” Daniels said in a profanity-laced video on his Instagram account.

“Hold your head up Jussie,” Lee added.

The two unknown assailants, police said, approached Smollett on the street about 2 a.m. CST and began a “possible racially motivated” attack, yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

The assailants hit him in the face, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives were gathering video of the area and looking for witnesses.

A representative for Smollett did not respond to requests for comment.

“Empire,” a hip-hop musical drama series, premiered on Fox Television in 2015. Its lead actress, Taraji P. Henson, won a Golden Globe Award in 2016 for her role and the show has received multiple Emmy Award nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Smollett’s colleagues said they were shocked.

“The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,” Empire co-creator Danny Strong said on Twitter.

Raquel Willis, an African-American transgender rights activist and executive editor of Out magazine, a lifestyle publication that centers on the LGBT community, condemned the attack on Twitter.

“The hate that fuels white supremacy is the same hate that fuels homophobia,” Willis said. “A conscientious society realizes it’s at war with both.”"

Both men were wearing ski masks, the source told TMZ, and Smollett was hospitalized with a fractured rib. The actor was discharged later Tuesday morning. Fox Studios also reportedly received a letter that sources tell TMZ was sent eight days ago, which reads “You will die black fag.”

Fox News can confirm the actor is Smollett.

Police also told Fox News on Tuesday evening that Smollett said the attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country.” Investigators said he gave the detail to detectives during a follow-up inquiry, not when he initially reported the incident to police. Further details were unclear.

According to police, the actor told them the men struck him in the face with their hands and poured an unknown chemical on him before wrapping a rope around his neck.

The alleged victim was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he is being treated and is in good condition, police said.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Chicago Police said in a statement. ""Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.""

A rep for Smollett did not return Fox News' request for comment.

In a statement to Fox News, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Smollett plays openly gay musician Jamal Lyon on the Fox series. The actor told Ellen DeGeneres in 2015 that he identifies as gay but does not discuss his personal life in public.

""I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is without a doubt, no closet that I've ever been in, and I just wanted to make that clear. But it was most important for me to make that clear to you on your show at this time in the world. And that's where I'm at,"" he shared.

According to Variety, Smollett was in Chicago to perform at a show on Saturday.

This is absolutely horrifying.

Jussie Smollett was attacked by two men who beat him up, put his head in a noose, and shouted, “This is MAGA country”, TMZ reports.

The assault happened at around 2AM on Tuesday morning, shortly after Smollett arrived in Chicago from New York.

According to sources, 36-year-old Smollett went into a sandwich shop for a bite to eat when one of the two men, who are being described as white and wearing ski masks, shouted, “Aren’t you that f*ggot ‘Empire’ n*gger?”

The men then jumped on Smollett, beating him so badly that they fractured one of his ribs. After pinning him down, they put a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him, and shouted “This is MAGA country!” before fleeing the scene.

Smollett was rushed to Northwestern Memorial, where he was treated and discharged a few hours later.

ThatGrapeJuice.Net published a letter which was purportedly addressed to Smollett and sent to Fox Studios in Chicago with cut out letters spelling, “You will die black f*g.”

The letter was sent a few days before the attack.

The Chicago Police Department are investigating.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter.

The statement added that the victim is in a ""good condition"" in hospital after presenting himself for treatment.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

""Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.""

Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon in Empire, came out as gay during an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2015.

TMZ reports Smollett, who is black, was attacked by two white men in ski masks who allegedly pulled a noose around his neck and shouted racial slurs while beating him, fracturing a rib.

""Extra"" has obtained the dispatch call, which noted that Jussie ""was assaulted when he walked out of his apartment.""

Smollett has already been released from Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

Chicago police are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

In a statement to ""Extra,"" Anthony Guglielmi, chief spokesperson of the Chicago Police Department, confirmed the attack, saying, ""Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire. Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.

""Empire"" co-creator Lee Daniels shared his emotional reaction to the attack on Instagram. He said, ""You didn’t deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die f**got n**ga’ or whatever they said to you.

Meanwhile, Smollett is out of the hospital, according to a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it. And he is still planning to perform his concert scheduled for Saturday at West Hollywood's Troubadour.

In an earlier statement on Tuesday, Guglielmi said that Smollett, who had returned Chicago one day earlier for work, was fully cooperating with investigators and helping them establish a timeline of the assault.

Guglielmi told USA TODAY that Smollett, 36, was approached in the early hours of Tuesday morning by two people who ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" adding that they punched him in the face, poured a chemical on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

Smollett went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital to have the cuts on his face and neck treated. He was described as being in good condition and on Wednesday, his representative, Pamela Sharp, told USA TODAY that he was ""recovering well.""

Sgt. Cindy Guerra confirmed to USA TODAY that Smollett said in a follow-up interview the next day that his alleged attackers yelled, ""This is MAGA country.""

""We ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com,"" police said.

CPD Officer Michael Carroll confirmed to USA TODAY that the FBI is investigating a threatening letter containing a white substance that was sent to Smollett at Fox's Chicago studios on Jan. 22. The powder was later determined to be acetaminophen, or Tylenol.

Fox, which had already suspended filming because of record cold temperatures in Chicago, told USA TODAY that ""Empire"" will begin shooting again on Thursday. The network has not indicated whether the attack on Smollett will cause further delay.

However, the network and 20th Century Fox Television, which produces the show, condemned the attack on the actor in a public statement on Tuesday afternoon.

""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our 'Empire' family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night.

""The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate – and especially against one of our own.""

Smollett is gay, like his ""Empire"" character Jamal Lyon, a singer/songwriter who has a tense relationship with his homophobic music mogul father (Terrence Howard).

Smollett expanded on his own sexuality in a 2016 interview with Out Magazine.

""I am a gay man with an extremely open heart ... If I had to label myself, I would label myself as a gay man,"" he told the magazine at the time. ""If I fall in love down the road with a woman, I'm going to love that woman.""

Smollett in his own words: 'Empire' star is as 'honest as possible'

Smollett received many messages of support from his ""Empire"" co-stars and other celebrities on social media, including Ellen DeGeneres, who recalled him coming out on her show in 2015.

Several stars and politicians are demanding that Smollett's attackers be brought to justice and that the incident inspire lasting change.

Actress Viola Davis tweeted, ""THIS is why the LGBTQ community continue to fight to be seen and PROTECTED against hate!""

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) stressed the urgent need to pass legislation adding lynching to the list of federal hate crimes.

""The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching,"" Booker wrote. ""I'm glad he's safe.""

""To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime – I urge you to pay attention.""

Bobby Rush, the Chicago congressman who introduced H.R. 35, the bill that Booker referenced, tweeted Wednesday that he had contacted FBI director Christopher Wray to ask for ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack"" on Smollett.

In a statement, he called the attack ""a hate crime plain and simple"" and vowed not to ""stand by while evil acts are inflicted on any citizen, especially not in my hometown.""

Rush added, ""I am even more disturbed by the manner in which this crime was carried out, particularly at the media reports of the attempted lynching, which harkens back to some of the darkest days in our history.""

He thanked the Chicago Police Department and FBI ""for their swift action and thorough investigation"" and exhorted his colleagues to support his anti-lynching legislation, which he said would ""ensure perpetrators receive an enhanced sentence under hate crimes statutes.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned the assault, saying the ""racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity.""

""No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love,"" she tweeted. ""I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.""

Janelle Monae posted a rallying cry in support of Smollett to her Instagram page.

""THIS HATE CRIME against our brother @jussiesmollett is proof that no matter how famous you may be it still does not protect you from vicious racist homophobes !!"" she wrote. ""AND It is still a risk daily to be a BLACK , OUT, and PROUD human being.""

Shonda Rhimes urged her followers to rise up against incidents like this.

""We ALL have a responsibility to rise up against the ignorance and hate out there. If you know who did this to @JussieSmollett, REPORT THEM TO THE POLICE,"" she tweeted."

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was reported to be in good condition after taking himself to a hospital after the incident early on Tuesday, police said.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police said in a statement.

Police did not identify Smollett by name, but gave his age and said he had a role on “Empire.” The show’s co-creator, Lee Daniels, and representatives from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment confirmed he was the victim.

“We have to love each other, regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united,” Daniels said in a profanity-laced video on his Instagram account.

“Hold your head up Jussie,” Lee added.

The two unknown assailants, police said, approached Smollett on the street about 2 a.m. CST and began a “possible racially motivated” attack, yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

The assailants hit him in the face, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives were gathering video of the area and looking for witnesses.

A representative for Smollett did not respond to requests for comment.

“Empire,” a hip-hop musical drama series, premiered on Fox Television in 2015. Its lead actress, Taraji P. Henson, won a Golden Globe Award in 2016 for her role and the show has received multiple Emmy Award nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Smollett’s colleagues said they were shocked.

“The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,” Empire co-creator Danny Strong said on Twitter.

Raquel Willis, an African-American transgender rights activist and executive editor of Out magazine, a lifestyle publication that centers on the LGBT community, condemned the attack on Twitter.

“The hate that fuels white supremacy is the same hate that fuels homophobia,” Willis said. “A conscientious society realizes it’s at war with both.”"

TMZ first reported the news. The Chicago Police Department confirmed in a statement that a member of the Fox drama series was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery,” though they did not name Smollett.

The incident is being investigated by the Chicago PD as a possible hate crime, chief spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

According to the police, Smollett, a native of Santa Rosa, was walking in downtown Chicago around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by his attackers, who got his attention by shouting racial and homophobic slurs in his direction. The pair then beat up the actor, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene.

Smollett, 36, was transported Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and is currently in “good condition.”

Smollett came out as gay in 2015 on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.” He has earned several NAACP Image Awards for his role as Jamal Lyons on “Empire,” which is filmed in Chicago. He has been an outspoken supporter of several LGBTQ causes.

The attack prompted a storm of social media responses from celebrities ranging from Smollett’s castmates on Empire to Sens. Kamala Harris and Corey Booker expressing support for the actor and decrying the violent and hateful nature of the attack.

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe. To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention. https://t.co/EwXFxl5f2m — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) January 29, 2019

“Empire” creator Lee Daniels addressed the attack in a video he posted on Instagram.

“You didn’t deserve to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die f––––t, n––––r,’ or whatever they said to you,” “Empire” creator Lee Daniels said in a video posted on Instagram. “You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united.”"

In a statement on Tuesday, the Chicago Police Department revealed details of a “possible racially charged” assault and battery that took place in the city early Tuesday morning. According to the report, Smollett was walking down the street when two offenders approached him and began yelling racial and homophobic slurs toward him.

The offenders then became physically violent, battering Smollett with their hands and pouring an “unknown chemical substance” on him. At some point during the attack, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene. Smollett told police that the assailants “yelled pro-‘Make America Great Again’ [MAGA] comments during the attack,” according to The Hollywood Reporter.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” the Chicago PD’s statement reads. “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.”

Smollett is said to be in good condition and cooperating fully with investigators. TVLine has reached out to Fox for comment on whether production on Empire might be affected.

UPDATE: 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment have responded to the incident with the following statement: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Anyone with information about the assault is encouraged to call CPD detectives at (312) 747-8382 or report it anonymously here.

There is evidence to suggest the attack was premeditated. According to a report from That Grape Juice, Smollett had previously received a disturbing death threat in the mail, in which a drawing of him getting shot was accompanied by his name and a homophobic slur."

(Reuters) - Chicago police said on Tuesday they were investigating an assault on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett as a possible hate crime after two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs and wrapped a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was reported to be in good condition after taking himself to a hospital after the incident early on Tuesday, police said.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" Chicago police said in a statement.

Police did not identify Smollett by name, but gave his age and said he had a role on ""Empire."" The show's co-creator, Lee Daniels, and representatives from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment confirmed he was the victim.

""We have to love each other, regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are united,"" Daniels said in a profanity-laced video on his Instagram account.

""Hold your head up Jussie,"" Lee added.

The two unknown assailants, police said, approached Smollett on the street about 2 a.m. CST and began a ""possible racially motivated"" attack, yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

The assailants hit him in the face, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

Detectives were gathering video of the area and looking for witnesses.

A representative for Smollett did not respond to requests for comment.

""Empire,"" a hip-hop musical drama series, premiered on Fox Television in 2015. Its lead actress, Taraji P. Henson, won a Golden Globe Award in 2016 for her role and the show has received multiple Emmy Award nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Smollett's colleagues said they were shocked.

""The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,"" Empire co-creator Danny Strong said on Twitter.

Raquel Willis, an African-American transgender rights activist and executive editor of Out magazine, a lifestyle publication that centers on the LGBT community, condemned the attack on Twitter.

""The hate that fuels white supremacy is the same hate that fuels homophobia,"" Willis said. ""A conscientious society realizes it's at war with both."""

PREVIOUSLY:

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was reportedly attacked in Chicago early Tuesday morning in what police are calling a possible hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed to HuffPost it had received a report Tuesday morning that a cast member on the Fox drama was the victim of a “possible racially-charged assault and battery.” Smollett was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after the attack but has already been released. Police said he is in “good condition.”

The FBI has taken over the investigation amid reports that Smollett received a threatening letter sometime before the attack, according to ABC News.

Police said Smollett told them two men began “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” before physically attacking the actor. During the attack, the two men “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him, and one of the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck, he said.

TMZ, citing unnamed sources “directly connected to Jussie,” reported that the men yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him. The outlet also reported that the unknown chemical substance was bleach and that, after the attack, the men told Smollett, “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police told HuffPost Tuesday morning. “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.”

The actor came out as gay during an interview on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” in 2015.

“It was a bigger deal to everyone than it was for me. But at the same time I do understand why it is something to talk about,” Smollett said at the time, adding, “I was ready to talk about it. She told me, ‘You don’t have to.’ I will be forever grateful to Ellen for the kindness she showed me. And that made me want to talk about it.”

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said that the company is “deeply saddened and outraged” by the attack.

“We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,” the company wrote in a statement. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

People, including actress Zendaya and the Rev. Al Sharpton, reacted to the terrible news on Twitter.

Chad Griffin, president of Human Rights Campaign, noted that the reported violence against Smollett was part of a pattern: “This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident. There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities ― and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities.”

This article has been updated to include more information about the attack on Smollett, Fox’s statement and Griffin’s comment.

Actor Jussie Smollett, best known for his work on Empire, was hospitalized in Chicago after an attack that authorities say was racist and homophobic, Entertainment Tonight reports.

Smollett is reportedly in good condition at a Chicago hospital. A representative for the actor did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.

The Chicago Police Department issued a statement detailing the alleged attack and saying they are “treating it as a possible hate crime.” According to the report, a 36-year-old man, identified only as “a cast member of the television show Empire,” was approached by two people who “gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him.”

The report continues: “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.” Eventually, the alleged assailants fled and Smollett was reportedly able to take himself to a nearby hospital.

Chicago police and detectives are working to gather video that might capture the incident, while they’re also looking for possible witnesses and trying to establish an investigative timeline. Authorities are also asking people to come forward if they have any information about the attack.

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserve, to have a noose put around your neck [or] to have bleach thrown on you,” Empire creator Lee Daniels said on Instagram. “You are better than that. America is better than that. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows that we are on an united front and no racist fuck can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up, Jussie. It’s just another fucking day in America.”

Smollett came out publicly as gay during a March 2015 appearance on Ellen just as Empire was taking off. “There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he said. “So that’s why I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in, and I just wanted to make that clear, but it was most important for me to make that clear to you on your show at this time in the world. And that’s where I’m at.”"

Chicago police are investigating the brutal incident as a hate crime. Meanwhile, the FBI is separately looking into a letter threatening the actor sent a week ago to the offices of the television show.

The actor, 35-year-old Jussie Smollett, flew into Chicago from New York on Monday to continue filming the new season of “Empire.”

Smollett went for a late-night meal sometime after midnight at a Subway restaurant at 511 N. McClurg Court, police said. The actor was walking back to a nearby apartment about 2 a.m. when two people walked up to him in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street, yelling racist and homophobic slurs, Smollett told police.

“The alleged assailants made racially charged comments to the victim implying that they knew he was a star from the show,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

They then hit him in the face, poured a substance — suspected to be bleach — on him and put a rope around his neck, police said.

Smollett initially was “reluctant” to call police because of the attention he would generate as a public figure, Guglielmi said. But his manager eventually called at 2:42 a.m., about 40 minutes after the attack.

When officers showed up at the apartment, the rope was still around Smollett’s neck, said Guglielmi, who described the rope as a “thin, light rope.” Guglielmi said the rope didn’t necessarily resemble a noose.

Smollett asked officers to turn off their body cameras while interviewing him, which Guglielmi said is standard for many victims, especially inside a home.

After taking Smollett’s report, officers encouraged him to go to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment to lacerations on his face and neck, Guglielmi said. Smollett’s manager took him to the hospital, and he was later released.

Smollett initially told police his attackers were two men wearing ski masks and all black clothing. In a follow-up interview in the morning, Smollett told detectives the men also yelled “this is MAGA country” after they attacked him, according to Guglielmi. Smollett didn’t provide any other description of the men, including their race.

Police also haven’t found any video showing the attackers in the surrounding areas or any witnesses to the attack. Guglielmi said police didn’t have enough information as of Tuesday night to put out a description of the attackers.

The block where the attack took place has some parking garage entrances but no retail businesses. But police were able to recover video from various business, residential and police cameras in the wider area. A surveillance camera at the Subway shows Smollett at the restaurant.

More than a dozen police detectives, some specializing in hate crimes, are working the case. They asked anyone with who has information or witnessed the attack to call detectives at (312) 747-8382 or submit an anonymous tip at cpdtip.com.

Meanwhile, the letter that the FBI is investigating was sent on Jan. 22 to Fox and “Empire” offices and used “threatening language” toward Smollett, police said. The letter was laced with some type of white, powdery substance, according to Guglielmi.

A celebrity website, GrapeJuice.net, published a picture of the letter with the words, “You will die black f–,” written in letters apparently cut from magazines.

The FBI declined to comment on the case.

Smollett’s role as the gay son of a record company mogul in the Fox drama propelled him to fame after it debuted four years ago. Smollett, who is gay, has been active in LBGTQ issues. He also released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels voiced his disgust over the incident and his support for Smollett in an Instagram video.

“You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,” Daniels said. “You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.”

“We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,”20th Century Fox officials wrote in a statement. “The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

“He is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I’ve ever met,” Harris said Tuesday."

The Blast obtained an emergency dispatch call placed around 2:30 am Tuesday, reportedly after Smollett’s friend called in the attack. The dispatcher said the friend claimed the actor “was assaulted when he walked out of his apartment” and that a “noose” had been placed over the actor’s head.

The attackers reportedly fled the scene before Smollett took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He has since been discharged and Guglielmi says the actor is in “good condition.”

The Chicago PD’s statement about the attack is below:

“Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire.

Smollett is openly gay and confirmed it during a 2015 interview with Ellen Degeneres.

They add that Jussie had previously received a startling message through mail calling him a “f***t.”

“You will die black f***t,” read the note.

TMZ has additional details and they’re reporting that the actor was attacked while leaving a local Subway restaurant by white men who yelled, “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****?”

They then attacked him, fractured a rib, and put a noose around his neck while yelling “This is MAGA country.” The men also reportedly poured bleach on him.

Jussie was taken to Northwestern Memorial and discharged. Chicago Police are investigating the incident which seems premeditated.

Chicago Police are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Actor Jussie Smollett has been hospitalized and treated in Chicago after a violent attack late Monday night.

According to a report in TMZ, sources close to the “Empire” star say Smollett had landed in Chicago from New York at around 2 a.m. and went to a Subway restaurant. As he walked out, someone reportedly yelled homophobic and racist slurs at him.

TMZ reports two white men wearing ski masks violently attacked Smollett. The actor fought back, but was badly beaten and fractured a rib. The men also tied a rope around his neck, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after the attack and was discharged Tuesday morning.

According to the entertainment website, the incident happened at around 2am local time (7pm AEDT) on Tuesday in Chicago.

According to reports, the 35-year-old was physically assaulted by two people who “placed a noose” around the actor’s neck and yelled “this is MAGA country”, referring to Donald Trump’s controversial slogan.

Sources connected to the actor reportedly told TMZ that Smollett had arrived late in Chicago - where he shoots Empire - from New York and went to a Subway sandwich shop to get some food when the two men started yelling homophobic and racial slurs.

TMZ reported that when he walked out, someone yelled, “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n*****?”

The two then allegedly started assaulting the actor while pouring bleach on him.

A noose was said to have been tied around his neck during the attack.

Sources close to the singer told TMZ that both of the men were white and yelled that “this is MAGA country”.

People wearing #mags hats perpetrated this violence. They called him the F word and poured bleach on him. @realDonaldTrump is this how you intend to make America great?

The actor was taken to a nearby hospital where it was reported he suffered a fractured rib.

Smollett has reportedly been the target of other attacks; US website ThatGrapeJuice also published abusive letters that the actor had recently received, saying, “You will die black f**”.

Chicago police released a statement saying they were treating the attack as a “possible hate crime”.

Police described the attack as a “racially charged assault and battery”, describing how the offenders “poured a chemical substance on the victim” and “wrapped a rope” around the actor’s neck.

According to TMZ, two white men in ski masks reportedly approached the 35-year-old actor late Monday, yelled out racial and homophobic slurs (“Aren’t you that faggot Empire nigger?”), then began to attack him with an unknown chemical substance.



Before fleeing the scene, one of the men wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck, as if forming a noose. They then yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

Sources via ThatGrapeJuice.net also claim the Empire actor recently received a threatening letter in the mail with “You will die black fag,” written in disturbing ransom-style cutout letters.

TMZ confirmed Smollett received treatment at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and has since been released. He is currently in good condition.



We’ll keep you updated with more details as they arise.

Update: 1/29/2019, 1:50 p.m. ET:

Empire co-executive producer Danny Strong issued an official statement in response to the disgusting incident on Twitter. Thankfully, he called a thing a thing. This is racist and homophobic.

“The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,” Strong tweeted on Tuesday. “Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

Additionally, several celebrities have taken to social media to express their support, including Lena Waithe, Justin Simien and Kerry Washington.

Update: Jan. 29, 2019, 3:54 p.m. ET:

The Chicago Police Department has reportedly released a statement denying claims of MAGA involvement and are not committed to confirming the assailants’ race at this time.

“According to the victim, the offenders’ faces were concealed,” a police spokesperson told Reason.com. “We have no record indicating that [they shouted ‘MAGA’], we only have record of them shouting racial and homophobic slurs at him.”

The incident is still currently under investigation.

“We have no record of The MAGA Country comment,” added the police spokesperson. “We have racial and homophobic comments documented.”

Mmhmm. We’ll see.

Update: Jan. 29, 2019, 4:35 p.m. ET:

David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition (NBJC) issued an official statement on the matter.

Black LGBTQ and same-gender-loving people, especially Black Trans women, face insurmountable challenges to living full lives. As we engage in the human rights work of advocating for protections of Black lives we must ensure we’re holding space for and ensuring protections for those of us with intersectional identities. If nothing else, these hateful demonstrations of policies and practices designed to destroy our communities should be a reminder that if they come for some of us in the morning they will come for the rest of us at night. In this moment in history, we must all work better together to combat the ignorance, hatred, and violence Black LGBTQ people face, and we need our governments and our elected officials to start condemning it openly and to fight back with transformative policy too.

You can read the full statement at NBJC.org.

Update: Jan. 30, 2019, 11:42 a.m. ET:

TMZ has spoken with the Chicago Police Department and confirmed Smollett followed up with them with key updates. Firstly, the Empire actor directly claimed the validity of “MAGA country” comment report. Second, Smollett reportedly still had the noose around his neck at around 2:42 a.m. when the CPD made contact with him.

In addition to the recently announced FBI investigation, police are looking into Target department store external surveillance footage they recently obtained, showing someone who is presumably Smollett walking down the street. CPD has also requested footage from a nearby apartment building.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” said FOX, the network that airs Empire, in a statement. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Advertisement

Update: Jan. 30, 2019, 3:48 p.m. ET:

Chicago Police gave an update Wednesday morning stating that they have reviewed hundreds of hours of downtown surveillance camera footage from the night of the alleged incident and have yet to find a video account of the attack, per FOX Chicago.

A few more notable people have released statements on the matter, including U.S. Representative Bobby L. Rush (D-IL) and Color of Change president Rashad Robinson.

Noted Robinson:

We stand with Jussie Smollett, who was targeted for living his life unapologetically as a Black, gay man. This attack is personal for us: Jussie has been a powerful advocate for marginalized communities. Color Of Change is in contact with Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx on this matter as our hope is to ensure that federal and local prosecutors conduct a full and transparent investigation. All efforts must be put towards finding those who committed this act of violence and bringing them to justice. The violent attack on Jussie is a frightening reminder of the white supremacy and homophobia rampant in our country, as well as the consequences of enabling hateful rhetoric with collective silence. We should remember that his attack is not an isolated incident. Violence against Black, LGBTQ, and those at the intersection happens every day and is increasing yearly. For those living at the intersection of Black and LGBTQ identities, discrimination and violence is compounded. We may not know their names, but there are many more people who live under the threat of violence and even death simply for being and embracing who they are. As reports continue to unfold, our hearts hurt to be reminded, yet again, of the hate and the pain that characterizes the Black experience in America. We will not be silenced, and as the largest online racial justice group with 1.4 million members, we won’t stop fighting for justice.

Rep. Rush wrote a letter directly to FBI Director Christopher Wray calling for immediate action.

“This is a hate crime plain and simple and I will not stand by while evil acts are inflicted on any citizen, especially not in my hometown,” noted Rush. “Jussie Smollett has brought pride to Chicago and made our great city his second home with his trailblazing portrayal of Jamal Lyon on the Fox series Empire. I am more even disturbed by the manner in which this crime was carried out, particularly at the media reports of the attempted lynching, which harkens back to some of the darkest days in our history. I thank the Chicago Police Department and FBI for their swift action and thorough investigation. I also call on my colleagues to support my antilynching legislation that will ensure perpetrators receive an enhanced sentence under hate crimes statutes.”

UPDATE (10:20 a.m. EST, Feb. 1): The letter sent to the studio where Empire is filmed prior to the attack contained a white powder, CNN reports. Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that the powder-filled letter, received at Cinespace Studios Jan. 22, prompted a response from a HAZMAT unit, though its contents were later determined to be aspirin. Though That Grape Juice previously reported that the letter said ""You will die Black fag,"" Guglielmi declined to confirm to CNN what the letter said.

Sources close to Smollett spoke to TMZ to clear up what they claim are factual errors in coverage of the attack. According to them, the actor never said that his assailants were wearing MAGA hats, just that they yelled “MAGA country.” They also say that Smollett did not still have the noose around his neck when he got to the hospital. They told TMZ that it was around his neck when police arrived at his building 42 minutes after the attack, however. The sources also said that Smollett didn’t refuse to hand over his phone records to Chicago PD, despite reports to the contrary. He declined to give police his phone, but not his phone records. He’s in the process of gathering those records so that police can confirm he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack, as he has claimed.

UPDATE (8:30 a.m. EST, Jan. 30): In a subsequent statement, Chicago Police confirmed to CBS News that Smollett did, in fact, say that his attackers yelled ""MAGA country"" during the assault. They are investigating the attack as a hate crime.

""As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area,"" said Chicago PD Chief Anthony Guglielmi in a statement to USA Today. ""We ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com.""

UPDATE: TMZ originally said Smollett's attackers shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" as they attacked him, but Chicago Police later said in a statement to the Daily Beast that ""there is no report of that being said."" Police also told Out over the phone that they currently have no description, including racial identity or gender, of the attackers.

ORIGINAL: Empire star Jussie Smollett is currently in the hospital following an attack where two people assaulted the actor, poured bleach on him, and put his head in a noose, TMZ reports.

Sources directly connected to Smollett told TMZ that the attack happened around 2 a.m. in Chicago while the actor was on his way to Subway to get some food. The sources said that when he walked out, someone yelled, “Aren’t you that faggot ‘Empire’ n*****?”

The attackers reportedly wore ski masks. In initial reports, Smollett says he remembers them saying ""This is MAGA country"" during the attack, but according to the Daily Beast, Chicago Police later said this has not been confirmed. Smollett fought back, and currently has a fractured rib after the attack.

In a statement, the Chicago Police Department confirmed they are treating the case as a “possible hate crime.” The statement says that Smollett is currently in “good condition"" while TMZ reports that he was released from the hospital Tuesday morning.

Music blog That Grape Juice, the first to post about the attack, also obtained a letter sent to Fox Studios in Chicago addressed to Smollett which said, “You will die Black fag.” TMZ says the letter was sent 8 days ago.

The New York City Anti-Violence Project said the attack is ""reflective of what we see in our national data on hate violence"" in a statement.

""Jussie is not alone,"" the statement reads. ""Gay Black men are some of the most vulnerable to violence in the LGBTQ community and this must continue to be addressed.""

Without warning, then, two white men reportedly wearing ski masks allegedly viciously attacked Jussie, beating him badly and fracturing one of his ribs in the process.

They put a noose around his neck, and even poured a substance on Smollett, before running off as he fought back.

As they were leaving, the two men allegedly yelled (below):

The star of Empire was attacked early Tuesday morning in Chicago, according to reports. Police are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Update, 5:30 p.m. Eastern: The FBI has opened an investigation into hate mail sent to Jusssie Smollett a week before this incident.

Actor Jussie Smollett has been hospitalized after an apparent hate crime in Chicago.

The Empire star was stopped around 2 a.m. on Tuesday by two men wearing ski masks who began yelling racial and homophobic slurs. They then placed a noose around his neck. The two men began to punch him and then pour an unknown substance on Smollett.

""This is MAGA country,"" the men then yelled, the Chicago police tell The Advocate, referencing interviews with Smollett after the attack.

The actor was able to self-transport himself to an area hospital where he is now in good condition and cooperating with Chicago detectives.

The attack is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” a police spokesperson stated.

As news of the attacks spread on Tuesday, politicians began to speak out the attack on Smollett.

Presidential hopeful Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker used the incident to highlight their anti-lynching legislation that now awaits Congresses vote after passing through the Senate.

“It’s outrageous. I know Jussie -- he is one of the kindest most gentle people I have ever met,” Harris said on the Senate floor on Tuesday afternoon. “It’s awful.”

Booker used his Twitter to voice similar concerns and push Congress to pass their bill with “urgency.”

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.



To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention. https://t.co/EwXFxl5f2m — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) January 29, 2019

The 35-year-old is said to have arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday before heading to a Subway takeout restaurant for food around 2 a.m., TMZ was first to report.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed the report of an attack against the actor, releasing a statement to ET saying two unknown offenders allegedly gained Smollett’s attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him.

They also said the offenders reportedly began to batter the victim with their hands on his face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

At some point during the incident, one of the offenders allegedly wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene. The star then took himself to Northwestern Hospital.

CPD chief spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement obtained by ET: “Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show ‘Empire’.”

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators.”

TMZ also reported the two men had screamed, “This is MAGA country” during the attack. Rob Elgas of ABC 7 Chicago confirmed some of the reported details after speaking with a Chicago PD spokesperson, as published in a series of tweets on Monday.

Additionally, in their initial report, Jussie Smollett did not tell police his attackers yelled “MAGA.” Chicago Police PIO added: “I’m not saying it’s not true. He could have remembered later, but he did not tell officers that in the initial report.” 2/2 — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 29, 2019

CPD also says: when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 29, 2019

ThatGrapeJuice.Net published a threat letter by an unknown person, which had reportedly been sent to Fox Studios in Chicago eight days ago. It had cut-out letters spelling “You will die black f**k” on it.

Following news of the incident, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment (which produces “Empire”) issued a statement addressing the vicious attack.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our ‘Empire’ family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,” reads the statement. “We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stand united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson has also released a statement: “The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling,” he states. “The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric. It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse. As this rhetoric continues to bleed into our everyday lives, dangerous behaviour will continue to place many law-abiding individuals at risk. We pray for a full physical and mental recovery Jussie Smollett and many unnamed victims of this form of hate based terrorism.”

In addition, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis issued a statement. “Our hearts are with Jussie Smollett as he recovers from a hate-motivated and repugnant attack in Chicago. Jussie has always used his voice and talent to create a better world, and it is disgusting that anyone, especially someone who has done such good for so many, would be targeted by undeniable hatred,” she said.

“GLAAD condemns these despicable acts as well as the racism and homophobia that drove them. Law enforcement needs to urgently conduct a thorough investigation and continue to be transparent with Chicago’s Black and LGBTQ communities who may be experiencing heightened fears of violence,” added Ellis.

“Jussie’s experience is sadly not unique in today’s America,” the statement concludes. “Countless LGBTQ and people of colour, as well as those who belong to both communities, are faced with hate-motivated violence on a near-daily basis. We stand with Black and racial justice leaders to combat hate violence in all of its forms.”

After the news emerged online, “Empire” director Eric Haywood posted:

I will burn your fucking house down to protect @JussieSmollett. Write that shit down. — Eric Haywood (@EricHaywood) January 29, 2019

GLAAD also released a statement to Deadline, which read: “GLAAD reached out to Fox and Jussie’s team today to offer assistance as well as support for him. Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels took to Instagram to send his support to Smollett via a heartfelt video.

The 36-year-old man was walking in the 300 block of North Lower Water Street when police say two people approached him and began yelling ""racial and homophobic slurs.""

The identity of the cast member involved in the attack was not immediately released by police, but a friend close to the Smollett family, who has been in touch with relatives, told NBC News that Jussie Smollett was the victim. The friend said Smollett remained hospitalized Tuesday morning and was in stable condition.

Smollett came out as gay during a guest appearance on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" in 2015.

Police said the offenders began hitting him with their hands and poured an unknown chemical substance on him. At one point, one of the offenders also wrapped a rope around the man's neck, authorities said.

The victim took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where police said he was listed in good condition.

Area Central Detectives are investigating, police said.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. ""Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.""

Fellow cast member Vivica Fox also tweeted Tuesday morning that she had learned about the attack.

""IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!! SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE! PRAYERS UP TO U NEPHEW!"" she tweeted.

Other celebrities also condemned the attack.

Guglielmi said a statement Tuesday night that detectives had expanded their search area in hopes of finding surveillance cameras that might have captured images of the alleged attackers.

Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”

According to police, the actor was exiting a restaurant in the 300 block of East Lower Water Street when two suspects began yelling racial and homophobic slurs towards him. They then proceeded to attack Smollett, punching him before pouring an unknown chemical substance over him. At some point during the attack, one of the suspects wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck. The attackers then fled the scene.

A law enforcement official in the Windy City told Deadline that officers have been talking to the Empire actor directly about the attack and are in the process of confirming what the substance poured on him is.

Smollett drove himself to Northwestern Hospital and is in good condition, police said.

Smollett plays gay character musician Jamal Lyon, the son of Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) in Empire.

Smollett told Ellen DeGeneres in 2015 that he self-identifies as gay but chooses to keep his personal life private. “There is no closet, there’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he told DeGeneres at the time.

Smollett, a musician as well as actor, is scheduled to perform at Los Angeles’ Troubadour club this Saturday, and as of today the concert is still on, according to concert booker Sean Healy Presents. “We’re going on with the show as far as we know, until we hear anything different,” a Sean Healy Presents booker told the Los Angeles Times Tuesday afternoon.

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett says he was attacked in Chicago by two brutes who spewed racist and homophobic slurs at him, doused him with a “chemical substance” and tied a rope around his neck, police said.

“The Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show ‘Empire,’ ” the department said in a statement.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”

The openly gay 35-year-old Smollett, who plays singer-songwriter Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox series, was walking in the city early Tuesday morning when “two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” according to police.

They then “began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” while “one of the offenders wrapped a rope around” his neck — before both fled the scene, cops said.

Police said Smollett took himself to a hospital, where he was in “good condition” and, a source told The Post, he was released later Tuesday.

TMZ, citing “sources directly connected to Jussie,” alleged the assailants also yelled, “This is MAGA country,” during the assault, but a Chicago police spokeswoman told The Post cops “don’t have confirmation on that yet.”

The attack comes eight days after a letter was sent to Smollett via Fox Studios with cut-out letters reading, “You will die black f–,” TMZ also reported, alongside photos of the vile note.

News of the attack prompted an outpouring of support for Smollett from fellow actors and “Empire” colleagues, including from the show’s co-creator Lee Daniels, who said in an Instagram video it was “just another f–king day in America.”

“You didn’t deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die f—-t,’ ‘n—-r’ or whatever they said to you,” an emotional Daniels said.

“You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.”

A number of politicians also weighed in — including Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris, who labeled the assault a “modern-day lynching.”

“No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate,” the California senator tweeted.

The actor was allegedly the victim of a hate crime.

According to a January 29 report by TMZ, Jussie Smollett — who plays the fan favorite character of Jamal Lyon on FOX’s hit musical drama, Empire –was taken to the hospital in the early hours of the morning after he was brutally attacked by two men.

Smollett was reportedly attacked by the men, who were apparently wearing ski masks at the time, at around 2 a.m. Reports claim that Jussie had a noose placed around his neck during the attack, and that he had received a disturbing letter that read, “You will die black f**.”

The Chicago police department are reportedly investigating the attack as a battery. However, many are already calling it a hate crime following reports of the racist and homophobic nature of the letter the actor had received.

Chicago police released a statement containing details pertinent to the attack, revealing that Jussie was walking when two men approached him and yelled out racial and homophobic slurs. They hit him in the face — and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him — before wrapping the noose around his neck and fleeing the scene. The actor then transported himself to the hospital, and is said to be in “good condition.”

Smollett was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital following the incident, but has already been released with no serious injuries.

Jussie’s Empire character is a gay icon. Back in 2015, Smollett revealed to Ellen DeGeneres that he, like his character, was gay — and that he hoped by coming out that he would help others to feel less alone.

Last year, as World AIDS Day approached, Jussie Smollett — who sits on the board of the Black AIDS Institute — spoke out about the disease, and the role that it will play on Empire.

“We continually say we are a show that is rooted in pop culture but we would be frauds if we didn’t deal with actual things that are hitting our community every day. Pop culture is not just fights on reality television. It’s not just beefs. It’s real things happening,” Jussie stated, according to Forbes.

As many fans of the show already know, Jussie’s character, Jamal, is currently in a relationship with Kai, a man living with HIV. This has become a central plot of the series.

Smollett also recently donated all of the profit from his recent album, Sum of My Music — a sum which totaled over $125,000 — to multiple charities."

The incident took place in Chicago, where the hit Fox series films. On Empire, Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, the middle son of the music family dynasty. Both the character and Smollett are gay.

The Chicago Police Department doesn’t identify Smollett directly, but said in a statement obtained by EW that a 36-year-old cast member of Empire was walking when two unknown offenders approached him, yelling out racial and homophobic slurs. They then attacked the victim, pouring an unknown chemical substance on him and even wrapping a rope around his neck. The offenders fled the scene, while Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Hospital and is said to be in good condition. TMZ, which first reported the news, also said that he has since been discharged.

Chicago PD says they are treating this as a hate crime and are currently gathering video and identifying possible witnesses.

Representatives for Smollett have not yet responded to EW’s request for comment

In a statement, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said: “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Empire co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong both reacted to the incident on social media. Daniels shared an emotional video to “his son,” while Strong tweeted praise for Smollett and called out the perpetrators. “I’m deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks against @JussieSmollett,” he wrote. “He is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live…whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

In their own statement Tuesday, GLAAD says it has “reached out to FOX and Jussie’s team today to offer assistance as well as support for him. Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

Smollett’s portrayal of a black gay man on Empire was considered very noteworthy upon the series debut, and when talking to EW last year, the actor was excited about an upcoming “groundbreaking” storyline: “You’ve never seen two black men in this way,” he said. The plot turned out to be Jamal dealing with his partner, Kai, being HIV positive.

CHICAGO - A cast member on the hit television show ""Empire"" alleged he was physically attacked by men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs, police said Tuesday.

Police did not release the actor's name but a statement from Fox, which airs ""Empire,"" identified him as Jussie Smollett, 36. Authorities said they are investigating the alleged attack as a hate crime. Smollett is black and openly gay.

(Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File)

According to a police statement, the actor was walking near the Chicago River downtown around 2 a.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men who shouted at him, struck him in the face and poured an ""unknown substance"" on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that when officers first came in contact with Smollett, he still had a rope around his neck. While being interviewed by detectives, Guglielmi said Smollett told them that the attackers yelled he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The police spokesman added that the two men were wearing masks. Investigators have not found any surveillance video or witnesses from which they can put together a description of the offenders, he said.

Smollett was able to take himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was last reported in good condition.

Guglielmi also said the FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago last week.

The hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Jamal Lyon, Smollett's character, is the gay, middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Tuesday in support of Smollett. ""The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence,"" the statement read.

""Empire"" co-creator Lee Daniels also voiced his support for Smollett in an Instagram video.

""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,"" Daniels said. ""You are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.""

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

""He is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I've ever met,"" Harris said Tuesday, adding that she's still learning more details about the incident.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues and he released his debut album, ""Sum of My Music,"" last year.

""Empire"" is shot in Chicago and a Fox spokeswoman said the program is currently in production.

11:15 AM PT -- Lee Daniels released a statement, expressing outrage over the incident and stating, ""Just another day in America.""

10:45 AM PT -- Police are currently searching for any video evidence of the attack.

9:05 AM PT — Jussie Smollett told police the suspects threw bleach in his face. We're told the chemical substance is currently being tested.

Jussie Smollett had apparently just walked out of his apartment in Chicago when he was brutally attacked.

The Blast obtained the emergency dispatch call placed around 2:30 AM to responders after Smollett's friend called to report the attack.

The dispatcher claims a friend called about a friend ""that was assaulted when he walked out of his apartment."" The official also noted that the victim is ""supposed to be well known,"" and that a ""noose"" was placed over his neck.

As we reported, Chicago PD was also told a chemical substance was used during the alleged homophobic and racially charged attack on the ""Empire"" star.

The dispatch audio notes that Smollett refused to be transported to the hospital via ambulance, and instead checked himself into Northwestern Hospital. He was later released and is listed in ""good condition.""

The two suspects who attacked Smollett have not yet been apprehended, and as of now, the battery is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

The assault happened around 2 a.m. Tuesday morning outside a Subway in Chicago, with TMZ saying two white men wearing ski masks allegedly shouted “this is MAGA country,"" placed a noose around Smollett's neck, beat him, and left him with a fractured rib.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" reads the PD's statement, adding that “an unknown chemical substance” was poured on Smollett.

Before the attack occurred, Smollett apparently received a letter with cut-out letters spelling ""You will die black f*g."" Smollett has reportedly already been released from the Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The multi-talented 35-year-old came out as gay in 2015 in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres.

Complex has reached out to a representative of Smollett but did not receive a response before the time of publishing.

TMZ added that the Empire staff got together for an emergency meeting on Tuesday morning and that multiple actors were prepping in their trailers for the day's work. There was reportedly conversation about beefing up on-set security.

Judging from the letter That Grape Juice acquired, the attack was premeditated. It's unclear when Smollett received the letter, but it's accompanied by what looks like a child's handwriting and a crude drawing of him wearing a noose.

A Chicago police spokesperson told Complex that the attackers did not say ""this is MAGA country,"" releasing another statement saying ""there is no report of that being said."" In regards to the racial comments and homophobic slurs being reported, CPD states: ""We don’t have that information; the detectives are still investigating.""

The CPD currently doesn't have any updates on Smollett or the attackers.

Besides starring in Empire, Smollett recently had supporting roles in 2018's Alien: Covenant and 2017's Marshall, while also appearing as a guest host on Live! with Kelly for six episodes in 2016."

According to the site, Smollett was walking out of the eatery at around 2 am when someone yelled “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n*****?”

That’s reportedly when two white men wearing ski masks screamed “This is MAGA country!” A noose was wrapped around Smollett’s neck, and he was beaten to the point that a rib was fractured.

TMZ reports that he is recuperating at Northwestern Memorial.

According to That Grape Juice, Fox Studios received hate mail earlier this month targeted to the 36-year-old actor. Cut out letters from magazines spelled out “You will die black f**.”

The Chicago Police Department has issued a statement on the incident:

“A 36-year-old man was walking at above address when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him. The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene. The victim self-transported to Northwestern Hospital and is in good condition. Area Central Detectives are investigating.”

The 35-year-old actor was attacked at 2 am on Tuesday (January 29) in Chicago, Ill, TMZ has confirmed.

In addition, another site, ThatGrapeJuice.net, received information that Jussie received a note reading “You will die black f**.”

The site also is reporting that the attack was carried out by two men in ski masks who put a noose around his neck. Allegedly, the two men were MAGA supporters and they fractured a rib in the attack. Another report alleges that Jussie had bleach poured on him during the attack.

He was reportedly treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and was already released. Police are investigating the assault as a battery and a hate crime.

Our thoughts are with Jussie during this time and we hope he is okay after this disgusting and unthinkable act.

We’ve reached out to Jussie‘s rep for a comment."

According to ThatGrapeJuice.net, Smollett received a threatening letter that read, in cut out letters, “You will die black f–.” A drawing in red marker accompanied the homophobic note; the drawing appears to be of a man hanging from a noose, with a gun pointed at him.

Smollett Came Out on ‘Ellen’ in 2015

Jussie Smollett Talks to Ellen From the HeartAfter his character on ""Empire"" came out as being gay, Jussie faced a lot of scrutiny in his personal life. He had something meaningful he wanted to share with Ellen. #JussieSmollett #TheEllenShow #Empire 2015-03-10T01:00:00.000Z

In March 2015, Smollett came out as gay to talk show host Ellen DeGeneres during a taping of her show, on which he was a guest. After they taped his appearance on the show, DeGeneres shared an additional video sitting on a couch backstage with Smollett as he explained to her why it was important to him that she was the one he came out to. He said: “You’ve been such an inspiration to so many, but also to me. What you’ve done in the LGBT community is very much, in my opinion, kind of like what Michael Jackson did with the black community. Just that you are who you are, and he was just Michael, and you’re just Ellen. So it was really important to me to make sure that it got across that that there is no closet. There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in.”

As he continued, he said “I don’t have a closet, but I have a home. And that is my responsibility, to protect that home. So that is why I choose not to talk about my personal life.”"

Jussie - who is known for playing Jamal Lyon in the show - is thought to have arrived in Chicago from New York on Monday evening and headed out for food at 2am when he got hungry.

The website claims he went to sandwich store Subway and when he walked out he was racially abused by someone who recognised him from Empire.

The men, who TMZ claim were both white, then attacked him and fractured a rib, as Jussie tried to fight back.

They then reportedly put a rope around his neck and covered him in bleach, while shouting ""This is MAGA country"" (Make America Great Again).

Jussie came out as gay in March 2015 during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

He later told Attitude magazine: ""I get tired of the idea of someone telling me what my truth is. I've said from the beginning of my journey: I do not hide who I am. I love who I love. No one is going to tell me that somehow that is going to be my disability.""

""I am told so many times that I should not walk truly in my blackness,"" he continued. ""That I should not walk truly in my sexuality, I should not walk truly in who I am.

According to TMZ, Smollett was in Chicago, Illinois when around 2:00 a.m. he was attacked by two men wearing ski masks. The men allegedly placed a noose around his neck during the attack.

Smollett was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital to be treated for his injuries, but he is said to have already been released. Police are currently investigating the attack.

The outlet notes that prior to the attack, Smollett received some hate mail that included homophobic threats such as, ""You will die black f—.""

Smollett has been openly gay for some time, first confirming it during a 2015 interview with Ellen DeGeneres.

The following year, Smollett sat down with Out Magazine, and shared that while he identifies as a gay man, his general philosophy is that love should never be stifled no matter what your sexual orientation is.

“I believe that love is the only thing that matters, and I would hope that anybody would leave themselves open — not to gender, but to love,"" he said. ""I would hope that people would not close themselves off from what could be if, lo and behold, you meet somebody that just sweeps you off your feet, and you just can’t do anything about it.”

“If we truly believe that we are born this way, then why do we try to stifle the way we were born? If I fall in love down the road with a woman, I’m going to love that woman,” Smollett added.

He went on to clarify that he knows his words may ""be misconstrued,"" but added that “this is a conversation that deserves to be had, because we don’t all understand each other.""

""You’re not going to tell me that loving someone is wrong. That does not mean that heterosexuality is not very real. It does not mean that bisexuality is not very real. It does not mean that homosexuality is not very real. They are all very real,"" Smollett continued. ""But what I’m saying is, I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I don’t know how many times I have to say that.”

At this time, Smollett does not appear to have publicly commented on the hate crime reports. There is also no indication that Empire producers or representatives for Fox TV have either."

ORIGINAL: Jussie Smollett, 35, was viciously attacked in Chicago in a possible hate crime, which TMZ reports he was hospitalized following the incident. The attack — allegedly by Donald Trump supporters, who yelled, “This is MAGA country.” — occured around 2 AM on Tuesday, January 29. The site claims (from another report by ThatGrapeJuice.Net) that two men wearing ski masks allegedly placed a noose around the Empire actor’s neck during the attack. The outlet (ThatGrapeJuice) also alleged that Smollett received an alarming letter, mailed to Fox Studios in Chicago, with cut out letters spelling, “You will die black f–k.”

Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon in the hit Fox drama, was admitted and treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was released early Tuesday morning (January 29). The actor came out as gay in 2015 during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, where he said he hoped to help others feel less alone.

We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Winter's deadliest freeze in years is moving into life-threatening territory as 110 million people across the U.S. brace for record-breaking low temperatures with forecasters warning that frostbite and hypothermia could occur within seconds.

Sub-zero temperatures are now sweeping across the Midwest and heading towards the East Coast with the worst yet to come on Wednesday when wind chill could bring temperatures as low as negative 50F in some parts of the country.

Record-breaking temperatures will stretch from the Dakotas through Maine and forecasters have warned that the frigid weather could be life-threatening.

'You're talking about frostbite and hypothermia issues very quickly, like in a matter of minutes, maybe seconds,' said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center.

The National Weather Service have even warned that people should avoid taking deep breaths and talking outside to ensure lungs are protected from the severely cold air.

At least four deaths have already been linked to the polar vortex, including a man struck and killed by a snow plow in the Chicago area, a young couple whose SUV struck another on a snowy road in northern Indiana and a Milwaukee man found frozen to death in a garage.

Temperatures plunged on Tuesday as low as minus 26F in North Dakota with wind chills as low as minus 62F in Minnesota. It was nearly that cold in Wisconsin and Illinois as well.

The subzero temperatures are already hitting but the worst is still yet to come on Wednesday where wind chill could bring temperatures as low as negative 50F in some parts

The National Weather Service forecast for Wednesday night predicted temperatures in Chicago as low as minus 28F, with wind chills to minus 50F. Detroit's outlook was for Wednesday overnight lows around minus 15F, with wind chills dropping to minus 40F. It could be the coldest day ever recorded in Chicago, according to the National Weather Service.

Minnesota temperatures could hit minus 30F degrees with a wind chill of negative 60F. The potentially record-breaking low temperature forecast in Milwaukee is negative 28F degrees, with a wind chill as low as negative 50F. The current record of minus 26F degrees was set in 1996.

A wind chill of minus 25F can freeze skin within 15 minutes, according to the National Weather Service.

Officials in large Midwestern cities including Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago and Detroit were desperately trying to get the homeless off the streets on Tuesday.

Meanwhile one-to-two feet of snow was forecast in Wisconsin and six inches in Illinois, according to the National Weather Service.

Blizzard conditions were predicted across parts of the western Ohio Valley and snow was expected through Wednesday from the Great Lakes region into New England.

Even the Deep South, including Alabama and Mississippi, could see snow. Parts of north and central Georgia are expecting about 2 inches of snow or more in the coming days, along with freezing rain and ice-slicked highways.

States of emergency have been declared from Wisconsin and Michigan, down to Alabama and Mississippi. Cold weather advisories are also in effect across a broad swath of the central U.S., from North Dakota to Missouri and spanning into Ohio.

Air traffic in the region is affected, with more than 1,200 flights canceled and 1,500 delayed, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.

Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc said it would waive flight change fees for passengers affected by the winter weather in Chicago, Detroit and areas of the Upper Midwest.

Hundreds of schools and several large universities closed their campuses Tuesday as temperatures plummeted. Among the universities closed into Thursday are the University of South Dakota, Iowa State University and the University of Minnesota.

Minneapolis Public Schools officials have canceled classes through Wednesday, when the region is expected to experience frigidly low temperatures not seen in a quarter century.

Chicago Public Schools have also called off classes on Wednesday because of the anticipated cold snap.

The Chicago Zoological Society said it was closing the Brookfield Zoo on Wednesday and Thursday - marking only the fourth time the zoo has closed during its 85-year history - to ensure the safety of its employees and animals.

Homeless shelters were also preparing for the onslaught of cold. The Milwaukee Rescue Mission's call volume was 'unusually high,' but officials said there should still be enough beds for those who need them.

In Minneapolis, charitable groups that operate warming places and shelters were expanding hours and capacity 'as they do whenever dangerous extreme temperature events occur,' said Hennepin County Emergency Management Director Eric Waage.

He said ambulance crews were handling all outside response incidents as being potentially life-threatening.

MetroTransit said it wouldn't remove people from buses if they were riding them simply to stay warm, and weren't being disruptive. Chicago was also turning five buses into makeshift warming centers moving around the city, some with nurses aboard, to encourage the homeless to come in from the cold.

'We're bringing the warming shelters to them, so they can stay near all of their stuff and still warm up,' said Cristina Villarreal, spokeswoman for the city's Department of Family and Support Services.

Shelters, churches and city departments in Detroit worked together to help get vulnerable people out of the cold, offering the message to those who refused help that 'you're going to freeze or lose a limb,' said Terra DeFoe, a senior adviser to Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.

American Indian tribes in the Upper Midwest were doing what they could to help members in need with heating supplies.

Many people on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in the Dakotas live in housing that's decades old and in disrepair, or in emergency government housing left over from southern disasters such as hurricanes.

'They aren't made for this (northern) country. The cold just goes right through them,' said Elliott Ward, the tribe's emergency response manager.

The extreme cold was 'a scary situation' for the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, said Chris Fairbanks, manager of the northern Minnesota tribe's energy assistance program.

'We have many, many calls coming in. We're just swamped trying to get everybody what they need,' she said.

The cold was even shutting down typical outdoor activities. A ski hill in the Minneapolis area said it would close through Wednesday. So did an ice castle attraction.

The cold weather was even affecting beer deliveries, with a pair of western Wisconsin distributors saying they would delay or suspend shipments for fear that beer would freeze in their trucks.

The unusually frigid weather is attributed to a sudden warming far above the North Pole. A blast of warm air from misplaced Moroccan heat last month made the normally super chilly air temperatures above the North Pole rapidly increase. That split the polar vortex into pieces, which then started to wander, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research.

One of those polar vortex pieces is responsible for the subzero temperatures across the Midwest this week."
