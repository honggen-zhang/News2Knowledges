Jan 31, 2019 • Post A Comment

Just days before an apparent attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett earlier this week, a letter containing white powder was sent to the show’s set in Chicago, prompting a response from the HAZMAT unit, CNN reports.

The report cites Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi saying the letter was received Jan. 22 at Cinespace Studios, where the Fox show is filmed.

“Guglielmi said authorities determined the powder to be aspirin, but declined to give details on the content of the letter,” CNN reports. “The FBI is leading the investigation into the letter, he added.”

As we reported previously, Smollett also received a threatening letter containing racially charged and homophobic language a few days before he was reportedly attacked by two assailants in the early-morning hours on Jan. 29."

Kelleth Cuthbert accidentally became a viral sensation after her stint at the Golden Globes, earlier this month.

She became known as the ‘Fiji Water Girl’ on the night after managing to photobomb a string of famous faces on the red carpet.

And, while she appeared to enjoy the fame at the time, she is suing Fiji for using a picture of her in a cardboard cutout campaign – placed at shops in the US – which she claims was launched without her permission.

TMZ states she is claiming the company used her image on the standees without her permission as she never signed a deal for them to do so.

FIJI Water has since hit out at Kelleth – real name Kelly Steinbach – claiming her lawsuit is ‘entirely without merit’.

In a statement shared with Metro.co.uk, they said: ‘This lawsuit is frivolous and entirely without merit. After the Golden Globes social media moment, we negotiated a generous agreement with Ms. Cuthbert that she blatantly violated.

‘We are confident that we will prevail in Court. Throughout our history, we have had a sterling reputation working with talent.’

Kelleth became a sensation online thanks to her photobombing ways at the Golden Globes.

In most pictures taken from the red carpet, she could be seen standing in the corner in a royal blue dress, while a string of famous faces posed in front of her.

Not a shabby gig…

The model recently opened up about her epic photobombing ways, joking about her special talent to get in the way of pictures.

‘This is something I would go viral for,’ she told Glamour. ‘I feel like I’ve been photobombing people since I was a kid.’

But, when asked if she had any regrets about the whole thing, she confessed: ‘I wish now that I hadn’t chosen to sleep in a little longer.

‘I thought, I don’t need to put that much effort into myself…no one’s really going to see me.’

Metro.co.uk has contacted reps for Kelleth for a comment.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking in downtown Chicago before and after he said he was attacked by two masked men, including video of him arriving home with a rope around his neck, but they're still searching for any footage of the attack, a police spokesman said Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" the family statement said. ""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""

The statement goes on to condemn hate crimes ""happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country.""

FBI data shows a 17 percent increase in hate crimes nationwide between 2016 and 2017.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor was at home and recovering.

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett's apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven't found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects, he said.

Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Probe ongoing in alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

President Trump expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett said he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LGBTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

Jussie Smollett and his family have now spoken publicly about the alleged hate crime he endured early Monday in Chicago.

The Smollett family released a statement Thursday that makes clear they believe Smollett was the victim of a hate crime:

""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.""

Smollett broke his silence Friday with this statement.

Beautiful People,



Let me start by saying that I’m ok. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.



With Love, respect & honor...

President Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday that he saw the story the night before and that, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned”.

The president’s Trump International Hotel & Tower is in the general area where the attack took place.

Smollett, who is gay and black, told police that two masked men attacked him early on Tuesday as he was walking home from a Subway restaurant.

He says they beat him, hurled racial and homophobic insults at him, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Police are gathering and reviewing video from scores of surveillance cameras in the area.

They have recovered video that shows Smollett arriving home with a rope around his neck, but they have not found video of the attack itself.

They have also released photographs from videos of two people walking in the area about the time of the attack in the hopes that those people can be located and provide them with more information about what happened.

Zemarcuis Scott, 19, of Texarkana, Ark., pleaded guilty to attempted theft of property and commercial burglary charges, according to The Texarkana Gazette. He was sentenced to five years of probation and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and court costs and participate in any mental health treatment suggested by the probation department, the report said.

Authorities found Scott at Texarkana Regional Airport inside an American Eagle jet cockpit last year on July 4. He reportedly jumped a fence about 2:30 a.m., airport security told police.

The stan told authorities that he wanted to fly to a concert out of state. According to the Gazette, Scott informed investigators that he had been thinking about stealing the plane for at least a month. He began watching the plane about 10 p.m. before attempting to takeoff in the 44-seat jet–though he lacked pilot training.

Scott told investigators that he thought piloting the plane would involve little more than pushing buttons and pulling levers, police said.

Scott was found mentally competent to stand trial in December.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn't spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett's family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

The area is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants and has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home, Guglielmi said. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels."

The comedian received backlash for his public display of solidarity since people pointed out that the attack on Smollett was motivated by racism and homophobia, sentiments Hart has refused to aplogize for recently. Hart was removed from his Oscar-hosting post after tweets surfaced in which he used homophobic language, and then refused to apologize for it.

Rather than back down, Hart took to Twitter to confront those challenging the sincerity of his condolences.

Ira Madison, the host of Crooked Media's ""Keep It,"" responded to Hart's tweet about ""sending prayers"" to Jussie, writing, ""your funniest joke congrats."" The comedian then told Madison that he apologized for his homophobic tweets and claims that he exemplifies the change people like Madison wish to see.

""I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person. Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do...CHANGE!"" Hart wrote.

However, Madison then noted the immense challenges queer people of color face on a daily basis, and reminded Hart of his lack of receptiveness when the queer community attempted to educate him.

""I “harp” because my community of black queer people face violence 365 in America,"" Madison wrote. ""And when we tried to tell you that we weren’t trolling you but wanted to educate how your jokes lead to actions like what happened to Jussie, you went on Ellen to talk about your wheelchair movie,"" he continued."

Police have released CCTV footage of two ‘persons of interest’ on the night of the event, which is being considered as a possible hate crime.

In the attack, it is alleged that Jussie was beaten up, before a ‘noose was put around his neck and he was doused in bleach’.

It was later revealed Jussie had been receiving homophobic and racist hate mail days prior.

Jussie’s family later slammed the attack as ‘domestic terrorism’.

‘Hateful words lead to hateful actions,’ a statement shared with TMZ read. ‘This was a racial, homophobic hate crime.’

It’s a memoir about identities and the author's personal experience navigating the world as a black person, as a woman, and as mother of a transgender boy, Penelope.

In the early morning hours of that same day, Jussie Smollett was assaulted, a rope thrown around his neck. The ""Empire"" actor, who is a gay black man, said his assailants hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him during the attack.

As the news spread, Patterson, an advocate for LGBTQ people and board director of the Human Rights Campaign, posted on her Instagram account: ""He’s at a store getting food at night because he’s hungry. He’s Black, LGBT and famous. They attack him with words and with their fists, they throw bleach on him and tie a noose around his neck. They attempt to kill him. He’s Black and he’s gay. That’s it. That’s it.""

Patterson is noteworthy for her activism for her transgender son, Penelope, a topic area with still few voices. Her book spans the decades of her personal and family history and traditions, unfurling the myriad ways people identify: through gender, race, socioeconomic status, sexuality, and even location.

The author comes from a long line of activists “Gloria (the author's grandmother) was arrested more than 25 times … Gloria recognized very deeply that a new world order – for her, and for her children – was one worth fighting for. This was the responsibility left to me.”

Penelope, the child who would inspire her activism for the transgender community, isn’t a consistent part of the book until about halfway through. But throughout Patterson's retelling of her life before and after Penelope's birth, she expertly connects both the black civil rights movement and intersectional feminism with the struggle for transgender and gender nonconforming rights.

The book isn’t a how-to manual for parenting transgender children – and Patterson doesn’t paint herself as the perfect mother, wife, daughter, black woman or entrepreneur. But as she unpacks her past, chapter after chapter, her narrative buttressed by her family’s history and traditions, readers see the world as she sees it, sometimes heartbreakingly so.

What the book is: a woman’s journey of constant transformation and fierce love for a world where her children can live their authentic selves.

Some of the inspiring moments from the book:

When her affluent parents would put the author and her sister into different situations, rich and poor: “ ‘Jodatha,’ (her father would) say to me … ‘there’s no place you don’t belong. Walk like you own the joint. Because you do, baby girl. You do!’

When her mother encouraged her to feel beautiful when she looked in the mirror as a child: “Mama would then make us wrap our arms around ourselves and repeat: ‘I love myself.’”

In her experience at Spelman College, a historically black liberal arts college for women in Atlanta, Ga., her transformation shifted from her parents building her confidence to owning it herself, with the help of luminaries such as Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison and the inspiration of the school’s president, Johnetta B. Cole. “We, black women, were allowed to be all in our feelings, whatever they were – grateful, angry, inquisitive, bold, righteous – and whenever they surfaced. There, we learned how to simply be,” Patterson writes.

After coming into her own as an adult woman, a hard lesson she learns: “Once you give someone the power to judge just one tiny part of you, you invite that person to define all of you.”

On the societal and familial pressures of motherhood: “While (her then-husband) Serge could put on and take off one hat at a time – wearing ‘father’ sometimes, then ‘boss’ or ‘lost-in-the-clouds-creative,’ at other times – I was learning that kind of versatility wasn’t open to me.”

After Penelope identified himself as transgender: “His dignity was – and is – more important to me than gender.”

When she stepped into her role as fighter and protector of Penelope: “Standing still while someone is transforming can make the bystander uncomfortable, I know… But if they couldn’t recover from that initial moment of surprise, if they stiffened upon hearing me say these ‘strange’ new words in association with Penelope – ‘transgender,’ ‘boy,’ ‘nephew’ – that became their problem, not mine.”

On being an activist: “Change agents, those who aren’t asking permission, are often not welcomed. But they come for the world anyway. They are ready.”"

Kamala Harris has officially begun.

Harris announced her campaign for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 election Jan. 21, the day we celebrated the national holiday of Martin Luther King Jr. Harris was immediately attacked and criticized on social media by some black nationalists who called attention to her being married to a white man and her political record as she previously served as the 32nd attorney general of California from 2011 to 2017, and as district attorney of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011.

As an elected official, Harris should be held accountable for her voting record and public policies she has advocated and supported. But no one should be interested or care who she married or previously dated. Harris married who she loved. That’s all that should matter.

For some strange reason, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown addressed his past relationship with Harris in a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle and acknowledged giving her appointments that furthered her career.

“Yes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago,” Brown wrote.

As I read Brown’s letter, I couldn’t help but laugh. Brown, now 84, looks like a brown-skinned version of one of my beloved cartoon characters, Mr. Magoo. I always confused him at times with actor Sherman Hemsley, who portrayed George Jefferson on the 1970s sitcom “The Jeffersons,” so he should have been flattered and grateful Harris gave him the time of day.

For Brown to spill the tea on whatever dating relationship he had with Harris was in poor taste. It was an obvious attempt by Brown to stay relevant. But to kiss and tell puts Brown in a poor light, not Harris.

There are some who attacked Harris for her tough-on-crime policies when she served as district attorney and attorney general, but in reality Harris presided over the most progressive criminal justice reform legislation in the history of California and the nation.

On Harris’s watch, Proposition 47 released more people from jail than any other reform effort in the history of the nation. Many of those former prisoners shouldn’t have been jailed in the first place. Over 300,000 people have had their records expunged and rights restored to now access housing, student loans, health care etc. Prop. 47 also allocated over $100 million to victim servicea, mental health services and prevention/intervention programs for students. These are indisputable facts.

When you look across the country and hear about the many reform-minded prosecutors across the nation that are making incredible changes to the criminal justice system, that trend all began with Harris.

The fact that some black activists are trying to crucify Harris and distort her record is a shame, but I’m not surprised. We have always had those in our community that want to prove their blackness is supreme and uncompromising.

The attacks on Harris are similar to the same ones former President Barack Obama had to face and successfully overcome. My prediction is that Harris will do the same.

I’m proud to announce that I plan on voting for and giving Harris my full support. She’s the one who can beat President Donald Trump. I encourage those who are undecided to drown out the lies and distortions of her record and think and decide for yourself by visiting her website, www.kamalaharris.org.

I am praying for my fellow activist, actor Jussie Smollet, who was brutally attacked and beaten in Chicago this week. The “Empire” star told police the attack happened Jan. 29 at about 2 a.m. The 36-year-old actor was subsequently hospitalized and released, local authorities said.

Smollett has been cooperating with local authorities to find the men he says allegedly attacked him and shouted racial and homophobic slurs, police said. A just-released surveillance video shows Smollett walking across the street from two possible persons of interest, whose photos were released Jan. 30 to the public. In the video, Smollett walks out of frame for about a minute and reappears on another camera “wearing a rope like a neck tie,” police said.

Smollett told police that the men also allegedly poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, as shown in the new video. The rope was still around Smollett’s neck when police spoke to him, officials said.

Brandon Z. Moore, Smollett’s music manager, told ABC News he was on the phone with the actor when he heard part of the alleged attack. He also heard the words “MAGA country,” presumably from the alleged attackers. Smollet, who I first met years ago at a Trayvon Martin event hosted by our mutual friend Sybrina Fulton (Trayvon’s mother), is one of the nicest human beings you will ever meet. He’s uses his celebrity to advance social justice causes and I have been deeply upset with what happened to Smollett. It’s no question this is a hate crime by racist supporters of Trump. Trust me, there will be a response by black activists. Stay tuned.

In fact, they are naming it for exactly what it is: domestic terrorism. They also stress that these kind of despicable acts will continue to happen, ""until we hold each other accountable."" The letter continues: ""Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall.""

Read their full statement below:

In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.

With love & gratitude,

The Smollett Family

Chicago Police and the FBI have yet to make any arrests in their ongoing investigation, but have released surveillance footage of two men they are regarding as persons of interest. They are treating this case as a possible hate crime."

It has been four days but the games have officially started on Shipwrecked – and there have already been tears.

Daisy previously revealed she was planning to go undercover on Tiger Island, biding her time before she could join the Sharks.

Luckily for her, the opportunity presented itself in tonight’s episode, leaving her former teammates fuming.

At the beach party, Big T read a scroll out which said islanders had the opportunity to switch to the opposing tribe if they wanted.

While Harry was buzzing that Kalia might make her way over to the Tigers, his excitement soon turned to shock when Daisy decided she preferred the Sharks.

A little awkward…

‘The reason why I stood up is because last week when we joined, me and Freja, we both gelled so much better with the Sharks,’ she explained.

‘It’s nothing against you guys personally… They were good to me, they were good people. They’re beautiful people and I feel I would enjoy this experience a lot better being on their tribe. The past couple of days has proved it to me, I’m just not your kind of person, I don’t think I fit in, I’m much happier on Shark Island.’

Fair enough, right?

Daisy was in tears over the Tigers’ reactions to her departure (Picture: Channel 4)

But Daisy’s former islanders were less than impressed, with Liv throwing her water bottle and earrings across the sand.

She then became emotional and burst into tears, with her new pals consoling her as the Tigers laughed among themselves.

‘I just feel used. She used the Tigers so she could stay here. I think that’s wrong,’ Hollie fumed.

While Liv told the camera: ‘You sleep next to me. You’re telling me I can share your vibrator but you don’t tell me you want to move to Sharks.

‘I think she’s just a bitch! Fuck her! I can’t deal with mardy people.

‘We don’t deal with nonsense like that, it’s a joke.’

Josh attempted to get his own back on the tribe by pouring condensed milk over their toilet seat, before heading back to Tiger island.

Might be one of the reasons no one wants to stick with you guys, hun…

On Monday night, Empire actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two white men who beat him, yelled racist and homophobic slurs, and put his head in a noose; they also poured a chemical substance over him and yelled, “This is MAGA country” before running away. The actor self-transported to a nearby hospital, and is reportedly recovering in “good” physical condition.

Police are currently investigating the attack as a hate crime; they have identified “persons of interest” and issued a community alert with photos of two people walking away from a security camera.

On Thursday, Smollett’s family issued a statement condemning the attack. Per ABC, the family wrote, “To be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,” countering the tepid language used by outlets first covering the attack.

The Smollett family statement also highlighted the fact that LGBTQ+ people and people of color, and especially people who live within those intersections, fear and face being attacked every day, writing that people should mobilize against racism, homophobia, and hatred at every level. “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such,” the family wrote.

You can read their full statement below.

In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.

With love & gratitude,

The Smollett Family

Now streaming on Netflix, the action-packed film follows four black Vietnam War veterans—Paul (Delroy Lindo), Otis (Clarke Peters), Eddie (Norm Lewis), and Melvin (Isiah Whitlock, Jr.)— as they reunite at the Ho Chi Minh City Hotel and embark on a mission to bring home the remains of their fallen brother and squad leader Norman (Chadwick Boseman) along with a golden hidden treasure secured for them.

Based on an original screenplay by Danny Bilson and Paul DeMeo, Da 5 Bloods touches on the realities many Black Vietnam veterans of the '70s experienced upon their return home of civil injustice—from post-traumatic stress disorder to systemic racism to being called “baby killers” despite being drafted by the U.S. military against their will.

Lee and his production company 40 Acres and a Mule joined forces with fellow scriber Kevin Willmott (BlacKkKlansman), composer Terence Blanchard (BlacKkKlansman), and Netflix producers Lloyd Levin, Beatriz Levin, Jon Kilik to bring the Da 5 Bloods to life.

Ahead of the film's premiere, VIBE correspondent/host Jazzie Belle sat down with Lee and the cast—including Jonathan Majors who plays Lindo’s son, David— to discuss the uncomfortable significance of the MAGA hat, the deep-seated brotherly love between their characters, and what they hope viewers can take away from the film.

""Communicate with each other. This movie is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Whitlock, Jr. ""Hope. Learn your history and hope,"" added Lewis. ""Make sure this isn't just one chapter of your history that you know,"" pointed out Peters. ""Now, use this as the portal to everything else over the past hundred years, the good and the bad. The successes of the scientists, the mathematicians, the inventors, as well as the atrocities. There's a huge disparity in all of that stuff. And America would not be America without us.""

On whether the constant telling or our Black stories in films is retraumatizing or cathartic

Lee: It's a combination of both. It's not one or the other. As Black people, we go through some sh*t, good and bad. (laughs) It's hard, but here's the thing though. It's been hard from day one. 1619, our ancestors. That first ship landed in Jamestown, Virginia. It's never been easier. It's been getting easier, you might say, but it's never been easy from the get-go.

On whether Kanye's support of Donald Trump and the MAGA hat

Lee: This really had nothing to do with our brother. I mean he's not the only one that has drunk from the orange pitcher of Kool-aid. There's a very small percentage. We point out that Black guy's behind Trump at every rally hold up a sign [saying] ""Black for Kanye,"" so it's not just our brother Kanye...and also story-wise, character-wise, it really injects some tension between [the people of] the group. Because when you're in a war with somebody, that bond is like that. It's going to take some really extra stuff to see an issue come up where they're not on the same page.

On whether who has become more woke in the midst of today's protests

Lee: I think we've been woke as the new terminology is. I think what's happening is our white brothers and sisters are getting woke. I think that's the biggest difference. L.A. is a great great great example of that....and that's always been a thing. In many of our great writers [like] James Baldwin and I can't name them all, have said it is not the responsibility of black people to fix racism. That don't make no goddamn sense.

Delroy Lindo and Jonathan Majors

On the apprehension behind associating the MAGA hat with his character in the film

Lindo: The Trumpian piece, that was the only piece I was hesitant about. It was never, ""Spike, I don't want to play this part."" It was always about, for my initial response was, ""Spike, can we change this? Can we change that aspect? Can I be a conservative? Can I be an arch-conservative?"" I don't want to be this with that hat and all. And Spike needed it. Ultimately, he needed that component I'm the film. I respected that and I was able to get past it. It was never a question of me not wanting to be a part of this because I absolutely did. I just wanted initially to change that component. In retrospect, that component needed to be there. There were certain times when it was quite uncomfortable, but once I rationalized it in my head, it was a part of what was a number of other parts in the characteristics of this character that were brilliant to negotiate and engage.

On the lesson learned while working on set with Lee and the cast

Majors: It was a moment of listening, of being very quiet and listening and also knowing your cue and knowing when there is a void here for whatever reason. And usually, when you look around and say something is missing, it's because you're the one that's supposed to be feeling that. What I gathered from listening, was a great deal of experience. It's so interesting as an actor because we feel things and so to be opposite people who are also feelers, who also really, really, throw punches—no one's pulling punches, when they say it, they mean it. And to listen and feel that then and then go, ""There's the void. Oh, my turn,"" boom The confidence after leaving this project...I left this project and then went to work on my TV show. I had just come from wrestling and working and training at one of the toughest gyms in cinema. I was like, ""Oh, let's go. I'm ready for this.""

Norm Lewis, Clarke Peters, and Isiah Whitlock Jr.

On the importance of seeing camaraderie among Black men on film

Peters: I think it's extremely important. It is as important as you breathing. If Black men don't try to find a way to love each other, we might as well go ahead and give ourselves up, really. Because I grew up in the '60s where there was this ""flower power"" peace love kind of thing, that has stayed within me, you know? I love these brothers off the film as well. I think that it is important for the youth to see that and for the older brother to be reminded of that because they were doing it back in the day themselves, they just forgot. Don't let this world stifle your love.

On how different it was to work with Spike Lee on this film versus the others

Whitlock Jr.: This is about the 6th film I've done with Spike, so I've gotten to know Spike. I know how he works. I've grown comfortable working with him. I don't bring the anxiety like I brought with the first couple of films. I'll never forget when I first started working with him, he said: ""You just gotta relax and do your thing."" When he walked away, I said to myself, ""Do my thing. I didn't even know I had a thing."" (laughs) But I better find it quickly. Well, I found my thing and I keep doing my thing. Basically what he was saying was look, just be yourself and bring that quality to the film which is why you're here. I love working with him, I hope it's not the last time.

On how he landed the role as Eddie after Spike shared the film's script with him

Lewis: I stay up until four in the morning, reading the script. He called me the next day and said, ""Let's go have dinner."" We had dinner, talked about the script. Still no offer or anything like that. He's like, ""What do you think?"" I loved the script. I said, ""It's great. Congratulations, I hope that this goes forward."" (laughs) And then he said, ""What do you think about Eddie?""... ""Eddie's a great character. Listen, congratulations. Keep going forward, I hope this works for you."" He says, ""I want you to play Eddie."" Oh, thank God. There was some point to this whole thing and so from that, it was just so exciting and getting to know I was going to do a Spike Lee joint. Reading the script and [knowing] that it was a departure from what he had done before. I mean there's still a lot of the same elements, being that it's an action-packed film. The fact that I was going to go to Thailand and do this...all these great people that I'd admired for years. It was just brilliant.

With reports stating that the attack was racially motivated, MAGA Twitter is calling the attack a hoax but Black Twitter is pushing back.

Far-Right pundits like Michelle Malkin and Steven Crowder have used their large platforms to question the motive of the attack and if Smollett’s account of what occurred were credible.

The skepticism easily spread over to Twitter among that base, and the decrying of the attack as racially motivated and homophobic has been robust despite the Empire actor receiving hate mail at a Fox studio in Chicago.

Video shows two 'people of interest' in alleged assault against Empire actor

Chicago police are asking the public for help in locating two ""people of interest"" caught on surveillance footage just before the alleged assault against Jussie Smollett, a black, openly gay actor best known for his work in Fox's Empire.

Police released images showing two figures, both wearing what appear to be dark jackets, walking along a snowy street between 1.30am and 1.45am local time on Tuesday, nearby where Smollett, 35, alleged he was attacked less than an hour later.

Smollett reported that he was assaulted by two people carrying a noose and an unidentified ""chemical substance"" in what police are calling a ""possible racially charged assault and battery.""

Authorities at the Waller County jail said on Wednesday that Evan Lyndell Parker, 34, attempted suicide on Jan. 25 and died two days later in a hospital.

Parker was accused of killing a 64-year-old co-worker on Jan. 9, according to the Waller County Sheriff’s Office. He was booked into the jail the next day on charges of murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The Waller County District Attorney stated that it was unclear what led to Parker to attempt to kill himself.

“All outside agency investigations that include the Texas Rangers and Texas Commission on Jail Standards are pending along with autopsy results,” Sheriff R. Glenn Smith said in a statement posted on Facebook.

Bland’s death prompted police reforms that could have prevented Parker’s death. For one thing, face-to-face cell inspections were supposed to occur more frequently after she died. The Chronicle noted that Parker died a month after inspectors found that the jailers failed to meet standards for observing prisoners.

Bland was found hanging in her cell on July 13, 2015, three days after being arrested during a traffic stop. Although her death was ruled a suicide, her family members and activists disputed the cause of death and said racial violence was involved. Her family settled a wrongful death lawsuit for $1.9 million with Waller County officials and the state trooper who arrested Bland near Prairie View A & M University.

It was unclear if foul play was somehow involved in Parker’s death.

“All I can say is, it’s extremely unfortunate when it happens,” Waller County Judge Trey Duhon said. “Even with the best of precautions, it is always possible that somebody intent on taking their life could be successful. All we can do is make sure we meet guidelines and do the routine checks. At this point, it looks like that was done.”

Duhon also rejected criticism from inmate advocates who raised questions about standards at the jail.

“They’re certainly entitled to their opinions, but anybody who wants to come down to our jail and see all the changes and processes we’ve made since 2015 is welcome to do that,” Duhon added.

Speaking from the Oval Office on Thursday morning, Trump said in response to a question about the attack: “That I can tell you is horrible. I’ve seen it … last night. It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

Trump then pivoted to a talking point about the need for a barrier or wall on the southern border of the United States, seeming to link the crime against Smollett to crimes he alleges are being committed by undocumented immigrants.

The president did not elaborate further on the attack on Smollett, and was not asked any follow-up questions about the alleged motive behind the attack. According to TMZ, Smollett’s attackers allegedly told him, “This is MAGA country,” although the Chicago Police Department has mentioned no such utterance by the perpetrators in its account of the attack.

Smollett was attacked in Chicago’s downtown Streeterville neighborhood on Tuesday around 2 a.m.

According to a statement from the Chicago Police Department, two unknown offenders accosted Smollett by yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him. They then began beating him about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

At some point, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck. Surveillance video did not catch the attack, but shows Smollett leave the camera’s view, and re-enter the frame over a minute later “wearing a rope like a neck tie,” according to police.

Smollett and his manager, who claim they were talking to each other on the phone just prior to the attack, say the actor returned home and called police about 40 minutes after the attack.

Responding officers noted that the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and a rope draped around his neck. He was hospitalized and treated for his injuries before being released.

Police say that they are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. They say Smollett has been cooperating with local authorities to find his attackers, but has declined to hand over his cell phone to detectives, according to ABC News.

Chicago police have not yet found video showing the actual attack, but are currently sifting through footage from hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras to try and identify the men and develop a timeline of events surrounding the attack.

A Chicago police spokesman reiterated that the men are not being classified as suspects, but rather “people of interest” who were in the vicinity and may have information that could assist police in solving the crime.

Smollett’s family released a statement on Thursday expressing hope that police would be able to identify and apprehend the men behind the attack, and “bring them to justice.”

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the statement says.

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the statement continues. “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

Smollett has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ equality, and has not been shy in airing his political beliefs. In an interview with Metro Weekly last year, the actor was particularly critical of the United States and Americans’ complacency when it comes to fighting for justice.

“Trump is actually not such a huge misrepresentation of what our country in fact is,” Smollett said. “He’s what our country was built on — lies, deceit, thievery, let’s be honest…. This country is fucked up. It is. Point blank. Period. There’s no getting around it. We’ve got to clean it up.”"

President Donald Trump is publicly denouncing the assault of Empire star Jussie Smollett.

Speaking with reporters Thursday at an Oval Office meeting with manufacturing-industry leaders, Trump called the apparent hate crime “horrible.”

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

“That, I can tell you, is horrible. I’ve seen it, last night,” Trump, 72, said in response to a question from April Ryan, White House correspondent for the American Urban Radio Networks. “I think that’s horrible.”

“It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned,” he said before returning to his argument for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump’s comments come two days after Smollett, 36, told police he was targeted by two black-clad, masked men in Chicago’s Streeterville section near his home on Tuesday. Smollett was treated at Northwestern Hospital and remains in stable condition.

In his second interview with police, Smollett remembered his attackers calling out the abbreviation of Trump‘s slogan “Make America Great Again,” according to a statement from the Chicago police previously obtained by PEOPLE.

Even before the incident, additional security had been hired for the Empire set after Fox Studios’ Chicago offices allegedly received last week a threatening homophobic letter addressed to Smollett, who is gay. TMZ first reported the news.

The FBI is investigating that alleged letter, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told PEOPLE.

Image zoom Jerod Harris/Getty

In photos of the purported letter — which were obtained by GrapeJuice.net and TMZ — the words “you will die black f–” are spelled out in magazine letter cut-outs.

PEOPLE has reached out to the FBI for comment.

On Wednesday, police released photographs of two people they wish to question in relation to the incident. However, the images did not show the individuals’ faces.

“Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,” Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday evening alongside the photos of the figures, both wearing dark clothing, walking side-by-side. “While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.”

The latest in the investigation comes after Guglielmi told PEOPLE he was optimistic video evidence will surface that will help them solve the apparent hate crime attack.

Describing the details of the allegations as “heinous,” Guglielmi said police had widened their search of surveillance cameras — both public and private — in the area surrounding where Smollett said he was attacked.

“The victim goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men,” Guglielmi stated. “They were masked and wearing black clothing. They called him an Empire … and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.”

Guglielmi said the actor returned to his apartment afterward and called his manager, who quickly made his way to Smollett’s home. “The manager goes to the apartment, and they agree to call police. The manager called us at 2:40 a.m.,” Guglielmi added.

(According to multiple reports, both Smollett and his manager have refused to hand over their cell phones to authorities. “The victim and his manager reported that they were talking on their cell phones to each other, but CPD has been unable to independently verify this because they refused to turn over their cell phones,” Guglielmi told Radar.)

Police patrols “responded to the residence to take a report and the victim was still wearing the rope around his neck when they arrived,” he said. “He explained to them why he had the rope around his neck, and the officers closed their body cams at his request, because they were in his private residence.”"

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the statement continues. “Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.”

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family says.

The statement concludes, “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world. With love & gratitude, The Smollett Family.”

The star, 36, was allegedly attacked by two black-clad, masked men in Chicago’s Streeterville section near his home on Tuesday. Smollett was treated at Northwestern Hospital and remains in stable condition.

On Wednesday, Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi released an update on the case, revealing how investigators have acquired footage that could lead to the arrests of the Empire actor’s assailants.

The police also released two photos of the persons of interest, however, the images did not show the individuals’ faces.

“Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,” Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday evening alongside the photos of the figures, both wearing dark clothing, walking side-by-side. “While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.”

The latest in the investigation comes after Guglielmi told PEOPLE he was optimistic video evidence will surface that will help them solve the apparent hate crime attack.

Guglielmi said the actor returned to his apartment afterward, and called his manager, who quickly made his way to Smollett’s home. “The manager goes to the apartment, and they agree to call police. The manager called us at 2:40 a.m.,” Guglielmi added.

Police patrols “responded to the residence to take a report and the victim was still wearing the rope around his neck when they arrived,” he said. “He explained to them why he had the rope around his neck, and the officers closed their body cams at his request, because they were in his private residence.”

Describing the details of the allegations as “heinous,” Guglielmi said police had widened their search of surveillance cameras — both public and private — in the area surrounding the site of the alleged attack.

“The victim goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men,” Guglielmi stated. “They were masked and wearing black clothing. They called him an Empire … and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.”

In his second interview with police, Smollett remembered his attackers calling out the abbreviation of Donald Trump‘s slogan “Make America Great Again,” according to a statement from the Chicago Police previously obtained by PEOPLE.

Before Smollett’s incident, additional security was hired for the Empire set after Fox Studios’ Chicago offices allegedly received a threatening homophobic letter addressed to the actor, who is gay, last week. TMZ first reported the news.

The FBI is investigating that alleged letter, Guglielmi told PEOPLE.

In photos of the purported letter — which were obtained by GrapeJuice.net and TMZ — the words “you will die black f–” are spelled out in magazine letter cut-outs.

PEOPLE has reached out to the FBI for comment.

“These young men had to drive in from somewhere … they had to walk in from somewhere,” Guglielmi told PEOPLE on Wednesday. “If and when this occurred, we will find some kind of digital evidence of it. We have the largest private surveillance network in the country with 3,500 cameras citywide. That particular area’s saturated with our cameras as well as private cameras and red light cameras. If someone drove into this area, we will find them.”"

11:59 A.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. I'm honored to be here with many of the great American workers as we take historic action to accelerate the incredible revival of American manufacturing. It truly is a revival. Nobody thought it was possible, actually. And not only is it possible, but we're thriving.

We're also grateful to be joined by Secretary Acosta, Administrator McMahon, and Representative Robert Aderholt, Mario Diaz-Balart. And we're working on a lot of interesting projects in your neck of the woods, aren't we, huh? How's that all going?

REPRESENTATIVE DIAZ-BALART: Mr. President, you are a champion of freedom in this country.

THE PRESIDENT: I didn't expect that. I never told him to say that. (Laughter.) Well, that was a great move. Every once in a while (inaudible). (Laughter.) And you too, that I can tell you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Robert Aderholt. Robert, thank you very much. David Joyce, Anthony Gonzalez, and David Rouzer. Thank you all for being here. We really worked hard on this. And I appreciate your support.

In the eight years before I took office, we lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs. They were leaving. People were talking about the fact that you needed a magic wand; you'll never bring them back. You remember the previous administration, he said that they said - he said - they all said you needed a magic wand; manufacturing jobs were over. I guess you people heard that too. It was a little bit discouraging.

And since the election, we've gained more than 500,000 jobs - and that number is going to be very soon to 700,000 jobs - all in the manufacturing world, which is a beautiful world, a high-paying world, and very important for our country.

Last year, we saw the biggest increase in manufacturing employment in more than 20 years. Early in my presidency, I issued an executive order directing the federal government to live by two very crucial rules: Buy American and hire American. And I think that sounds appropriate. Remember in the old days? It was not that. It was almost the opposite. You'd say, 'Where are they coming from?'

Thanks to my executive order and a really great group of people, we have increased reliance on American-made goods very, very substantially. Federal agencies are now spending an additional $24 billion on American-made products instead of going to other countries or foreign-made products.

Federal spending on foreign goods is now the lowest it's been in more than 10 years, and it's going down very substantially. And, by the way, we don't get treated great by many countries in terms of our trade deals, and that's changing rapidly. But we are now looking out a little bit for ourselves and it's about time.

Today, I'm taking action to build on this tremendous success by strengthening the Buy American principle for federal infrastructure and federal spending.

We want American roads, bridges, and railways, and everything else to be built with American iron, American steel, American concrete, and American hands. And if you look at what's happened with the steel industry, it's actually amazing. The steel industry is thriving now and it was dead when I came to office. It was dead. It was a dead industry. They were dumping steel all over the place. The jobs were going. And if any of you were in the steel industry, I think you can probably tell them, you know. And aluminum, too.

But when you look at what's happened to the steel industry, it's been incredible. One of the great successes. And now prices are starting to come down because they're competing with each other. Nucor and U.S. Steel and so many of these companies, they're building many, many plants all over the United States. And as those plants open, they're finally competing with themselves.

We literally were not going to have steel companies. We weren't going to make steel in this country. And that in itself is a very important thing. We have to have steel. There are some products you have to have. And, by the way, steel is one of them.

You talked about defense - how do you do it without steel and aluminum and the kinds of things that we're really very heavily focused on.

By signing this order today, we renew our commitment to an essential truth: It matters where something is made, and it matters very greatly.

When I came to office, and I witnessed for many years - for decades, frankly - they didn't care where it was made. I care where it's made. It should be made right here in the USA. And we've taken a very strong stand.

I want to introduce, before I sign, Peter Navarro and Kevin Hassett, two of my great economic people. And they're going to give you a little talk as to what's happened and how good we're doing.

Peter, do you want to start?

MR. NAVARRO: Thank you, Mr. President. I remember back during the campaign, the naysayers said that this President could not restore the manufacturing base.

I'm just going to show you a couple pictures here. What we have here is a chart that shows the loss of 192,000 jobs during the eight years of the Obama administration. It did tick up a little bit during Obama's last two years: 73,000. But it is absolutely dwarfed by the policies of this President: 473,000 since Inauguration Day, and over 500,000 since the election.

And then you can see how the emphasis is on this administration in putting men and women who work with their hands to work. You can see the jobs created in the Obama administration: One percent of the total job gains were manufacturing compared to 10 percent.

And the folks here that you see on the President's right come from across this great country, and they build essentially the mother's milk of Americana. It's lamppost, it's fire hydrants, it's water mains. And we salute these workers today coming in this White House.

Kevin is going to show you another chart that shows how these distribution of manufacturing gains are across this country, and then we'll kick it back to Mr. President.

CHAIRMAN HASSETT: And again, the economics literature, Mr. President, when you were running for office basically said that manufacturing was going the way of agriculture in the previous century; that it was just on an inevitable decline as a percentage of GDP. But it also focused a lot on this idea that there was a rust belt in America. There was a place where there used to be manufacturing, where there was disproportionate harm to workers.

And I think the thing that's really, really interesting about the manufacturing jobs that have been created by our policies - your policies - are that they're scattered throughout America. The dark red part is a place where manufacturing jobs are up by 20 percent or more since you last took office.

THE PRESIDENT: Wow. That's fantastic.

CHAIRMAN HASSETT: And then the lighter reds are 10 percent or more. And the lightest red is 5 percent or more.

But if you look at all the pockets all across the country, including in places that people used to call the Rust Belt, where manufacturing employment is booming, what it means is that there's basically a boom belt from coast to coast that's been created by our policies.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know, Kevin, when I took over, the Rust Belt was really in trouble. Many people were saying it's dying, it's dead; people were leaving. And I love the Rust Belt, and the Rust Belt is no longer the Rust Belt as far as I'm concerned. It's vibrant. It's doing so well. You look at all of those red marks, those red marks are where it's flourishing. Tremendous numbers. And that's fantastic. We're very proud.

I wish, frankly, that the media would report how well we're doing in manufacturing, how well we're doing with the economy. They don't seem to report how well we're doing. I think if you had another President, it would be the biggest story, because it really is the biggest story, or certainly one of the biggest stories. And you see the market, how it is. It hit 25,000 yesterday. We're doing great. We're doing great as a country.

And we have a lot of bite-back because other countries are not doing well. China is having a very hard time. They're here now. We're going to be seeing them a little bit later. We're trying to work out a new trade deal with China. I think it will happen. Something will happen. But it's a very big deal. It will be - if it does happen, it will be, by far, the largest trade deal ever made.

And we essentially didn't have a trade deal with China. We lost $500 billion with China, for many years, a year. Anywhere from $300- to $500-, $505 billion a year was lost in our dealing with China. And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, and I think we'll sit down at the end - at the end of the negotiation by our representatives - and do something with respect to making a deal with China. I think it has a very good chance of happening.

But China is having a very hard time with their economy, and the European Union is having a hard time. A lot of things going on. And we're getting tremendous numbers. Tremendous unemployment numbers - among the best we've ever had in the history of our country. Individual groups the best: African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women. Numbers that we haven't seen before. The overall is the best numbers. Best employment numbers in 51 years.

So we're doing really well. I wish the press would report it.

I'm going to sign this. Before I do, I think I want to just ask a few of you folks, would you like to say something? Anybody? Anybody want to become a congressman by (inaudible)?

MR. MULLER: Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for the tax cuts. It's been rocket fuel for our business for manufacturing.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. That was great. Charlie? That was great.

MR. FORTNEY: Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for the - this Buy American push that you've got with federal funding for the infrastructure that's Buy American. It's jobs for us. And it puts us in a position where we can compete. Otherwise, we tend to walk to away from jobs where foreign competition is going to take our business.

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We're changing that fast.

MR. FORTNEY: Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT: Big difference. Big difference.

MS. HARRISON: And I'm with McWane, in Birmingham. We're based out of Birmingham, Alabama. We have seen a tremendous uptick. We're representing several divisions with McWane here, but thank you for everything you've done.

THE PRESIDENT: That's great. Great group. Thank you. Thank you all very much. You want to say anything? Anybody else?

Anybody want to become a congressperson?

MS. MARTINEZ: Just that it gives us an opportunity to hire, obviously even more opportunities that we have to fill positions as jobs increase.

MR. FORTNEY: That's Brenda Martinez with U.S. Foundry. She's our HR, and she hires people when we get more work.

THE PRESIDENT: Big difference. Right?

MS. MARTINEZ: Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all very much.

So how about our politicians? Now, they want to say, that I know. (Laughter.) These people - they're not shy.

REPRESENTATIVE ADERHOLT: Well, let me say, first of all, that this is a very commonsense, a bipartisan piece of executive order that the President - we have worked on legislation in the past that's worked this from the appropriations side from year to year.

But what this executive order does, it goes beyond that and it really tries to make sure that we - as the President said, American hands are doing the job and this is what we're - when we go back home, we want to see our manufacturers do well. We want to see them grow. We want to see our workers do - have better jobs. So thanks, Mr. President, for doing it. So, thank you.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Appreciate it.

MR. NAVARRO: Mr. President, if I may - this gentleman here has been a long-time leader on the hill carrying the Buy American banner, and his leadership is very much appreciated.

THE PRESIDENT: That's why he wins by so much.

MR. NAVARRO: Yes. That is correct. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: That's why he doesn't worry too much about races. You know? Just wins.

REPRESENTATIVE ADERHOLT: It helps when you've got a district that he wins about 80 percent. So - (laughter).

THE PRESIDENT: I think I did very well. (Laughter.) Come to think of it.

REPRESENTATIVE ADERHOLT: The best of 435 districts, so -

THE PRESIDENT: That's great. That's very nice. Thank you very much. Say hello.

Linda?

ADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: Well, thank you very much. I hear from small businesses, you know, all over the country, and they are very happy to be buying American and hiring American. And, you know, the job growth, it just speaks for itself. And our businesses are growing and starting and expanding.

THE PRESIDENT: Great job you're doing too. She runs the Small Business, and they're big business when you add it all up. She's done a fantastic job - Linda McMahon.

Mr. Secretary?

SECRETARY ACOSTA: Mr. President, you know, in the past, we've encouraged individuals out there to buy American. But what you're doing is so important because you're leading by example. You're saying the federal government will buy American. And we've seen the impact last year with, you know, a 10-year record low in foreign purchases. And this is going to take it to the next step, and it will translate into more jobs for individuals, just like those here today.

THE PRESIDENT: It's having an incredible effect. I mean, people don't realize it yet, but they're seeing it more and more. We are mandating even pipelines and things that were made elsewhere. They're starting to be made here because we have a steel industry again. But it's having a tremendous effect.

Please.

REPRESENTATIVE JOYCE: Thank you, Mr. President, I have been co-sponsoring a bill for years with Daniel Lipinski. Couldn't get it to go anywhere. I'm honored that you're doing it today to force it into action because, as you said, these are American jobs. It's American concrete, it's American steel, it's American asphalt. Thank you for doing so.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

REPRESENTATIVE ROUZER: Well, Mr. President, you can't believe how much my folks back home in Eastern North Carolina appreciate your commitment to the American worker, and particularly the American farmer. And I personally really appreciate you taking it to China. They have eaten our lunch for a long, long time, and I appreciate you standing up and really fighting hard for our American workers, and the job creation that's going to result from that. And keep plugging for America's farmers.

THE PRESIDENT: So China, as you know, has opened up because of us to the financial services industry, which is a big thing. Nobody thought that was possible. And they've opened up to financial services and things of the like.

But I just want to let everyone know we won't have a deal if we don't open it up to the farmers, and we won't have a deal if they don't open it up to our manufacturers, and just all of it. And I think China is very prone to do this. So we're going to have a talk. But we've already got financial services. A big impact. You have tremendous amounts of money. Tremendous amounts of people. It's a whole different market, and a massive market. I guess you could certainly say the biggest, or one of the biggest markets in the world, but maybe the biggest market in a certain way in the world.

But we're the number-one country in the world economically. I don't want people to forget that. We're the number one. And we were heading - we were heading south fast. We were going down, and we turned it around. And it started with the regulations that we cut. We cut more regulations than any administration in the history of our country in two years. And, actually, less than two years. And it also was helped by the tax cuts. Put a lot of people to work and really gave companies something where they're now coming back into our country, they're investing in our country, and they're expanding in our country.

So, a lot of great things are happening.

Mario?

REPRESENTATIVE DIAZ-BALART: Mr. President, I, again, it's amazing what leadership does. The economy is booming, you're rebuilding our military, you're leading around the world. Enough said.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I'm liking this guy more and more. (Laughter.)

REPRESENTATIVE ADERHOLT: Let me just add one thing that I have - this makes my 22nd year serving in the House of Representatives. This President has stood up more for manufacturing jobs in Alabama and across the country - not just Alabama - than any President. So I thank you for standing up.

MR. NAVARRO: And Robert and Mario have been leaders on the Reciprocal Trade Act, as well, that you're sponsoring.

THE PRESIDENT: I know. Reciprocal trade is going be very important. We're going putting in a bill very soon, where when a country charges us tariffs that are massive, and we charge them nothing for the same exact product, we just say, 'Hey, got to be equal. You charge us, we charge you.' You could call it a reciprocal tax, but some people call it a mirror tax.

So, if Europe, as an example - the EU charges us 72 percent tariff on corn, and they don't even want it, and we charge them nothing - it doesn't work that way anymore. So, you know, I've gone to many people that aren't that familiar with it, including politicians that you'll be dealing with soon. And I went to a couple that are always tough. I said, 'What do you think of that? They charge us, we charge them.' They looked at me and they said, Robert, 'Huh. Sounds fair to me.'

And, actually, you probably get rid of tariffs, because rather than charging 75 percent to nothing, now if you're both at 75, you say, 'Let's call it quits. We'll go to nothing.'

So it really has that impact too, as you know. Please.

REPRESENTATIVE GONZALEZ: Thank you, Mr. President. So, as you know, northeast Ohio is all about jobs and the economy. And Dave and I are from the same neck of the woods. And to see the cranes, buildings going up, to see steel jobs coming back - to your point, they said it couldn't be done, and now wages are going up. When was the last time real wages went up? It's been a while. So keep doing what you're doing, and we support you in northeast Ohio on everything with the economy.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

REPRESENTATIVE GONZALEZ: So, thank you.

THE PRESIDENT: And they're getting - it's a beautiful thing because I opened up, as you know - the best iron ore, they say, virtually in the world is in Minnesota. The big mines. They were closed. President Obama decided to close them. I opened them. And we're not bringing it in; we're taking it right from our own home. And we're having it made in Ohio. We have good ore in Ohio, too. But we're having it made in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, and all the different places. It's been really incredible to see what's happening. We don't need anything from outside of our own boundaries. So that's been really great.

Okay, let's go. (Laughter.) Does anybody want this pen? Thank you very much. Thank you all for being here. I appreciate it.

(The executive order is signed.)

Okay, here you go. (Applause.) Thank you, everybody, very much. I appreciate it.

Q Mr. President, (inaudible) your intelligence officials yesterday. Do you still have confidence in Gina Haspel and Dan Coats to give you good advice?

THE PRESIDENT: No, I disagree with certain things that they said. I think I'm right, but time will prove that. Time will prove me right, probably. I think Iran is a threat. I think it's a very big threat. And I think I did a great thing when I terminated the ridiculous Iran nuclear deal. It was a horrible, one-sided deal that was $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash, and lots of other bad things.

If you remember, they took our 10 sailors out of waters that people are disputing, and made us look very bad. But, of course, the payment was due the following day, so they eventually let them go, which they had to. I disagree very much on that.

I also think - and you'll be seeing something next week - because you look at what's happened in Syria with respect to ISIS and the caliphate. We took over a lot of area in the last two weeks. We've done tremendous in the last couple of weeks. At the same time, we're consolidating, and a tremendous amount of good things are happening.

You even look at what's going on - and I can't tell you that this is a guarantee because we're going into close to 19 years in being in Afghanistan. And, for the first time, they're talking about settling. They're talking about making an agreement. And we bring our people back home if that happens. We'll see what happens, but they're in very serious negotiations for the first time. There's a reason for that.

So I think we're doing so well on a foreign policy basis. If you look at North Korea - and many of you are going to be traveling with us to North Korea and - for the meetings with North Korea. We're going to a certain location. I think most of you know where the location is. I don't think it's any great secret. But we'll be announcing the location and the date - the exact date. It will be at the end of February. And we've made tremendous progress with North Korea.

When I came in - or, let's say, at the end of the last administration - frankly, it looked like we were going to war with North Korea. Now there's no missile testing. There's no rocket testing. There's no nuclear testing. We got back our prisoners or our hostages. And we're getting back our remains; they're coming in. And we've had some beautiful ceremonies in Hawaii, other places.

So I just tell you that we are doing really well. Our military is being rebuilt. It's very close to being rebuilt. We have tremendous amounts of new aircraft, new ships, new weapons of all kinds, which we need - because, hopefully, the stronger we get, the less you have to use it. I guess you know that from growing up in school. The stronger we are, the less we're going to have you use it, and we don't want to have to use it. But we're going to have the strongest military, by far, that we've ever had.

So I didn't see the report from the intelligence. When you read it, it's a lot different than it was covered on in the news. But I think that Iran is somebody - is a nation that we have to watch very closely. They sent up a rocket the other day, and it failed. But it was sent up. Now, they can say they're sending it up for civilian purposes, but I don't think too many people believe that. They're doing tests. And we don't want to be in a position where we're behind. We're not going to be leading from behind anymore.

So that's the story. I have great respect for a lot of people, but I don't always agree with everybody. Okay?

Q What concessions has China made so far in the talks? Anything on IP theft?

THE PRESIDENT: So, it's great. Well, we're going to - look, we're going to go into everything. You probably saw, this morning I put out a statement. We're going into everything. This isn't going to be a small deal with China. This is either going to be a very big deal or it's going to be a deal that we'll just postpone for a little while.

But we've been dealing with China. We've had a great relationship. I have a great relationship with President Xi. The relationship of my people to Chinese representatives has been very good. They're negotiating now. They'll be coming over here at about 4 o'clock, and we'll be talking to, actually, one of the top leaders in China, as you know.

I think that probably the final deal will be made. If it's made, will be made between myself and President Xi. But we're certainly talking about theft. We're talking about every aspect of trade with a country. And we're talking about fentanyl, too.

As you know, most of the fentanyl - which is killing 80,000 Americans a year is - it comes through China. And, in China, it was not criminalized. And they've agreed to criminalize fentanyl and give it the maximum penalty. The maximum penalty in China, if you're selling drugs, is death; it's the death penalty. And they've agreed to do the death penalty for selling fentanyl. And if it's shipped to the United States, that would be a very severe penalty.

So I think that's going to have a tremendous impact. We put that one item into the trade deal - the fentanyl. I think that's a very important item to put in. But they've agreed - they've agree, and agreed very readily - we really appreciate it - to criminalize the sale of fentanyl.

Steve?

Q Do you think you'll make the March 1 deadline?

THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. I mean, it's -

Q And you are going to add (inaudible)?

THE PRESIDENT: I can tell you, there's - a lot of people are working. What happens - we're charging large tariffs to Chinese products that are coming in, which hurts China. As you know - you saw the reports - out of the 25 points, we're paying for four points out of the 25. They're paying for 21. That's a big difference. I've always said that.

We're taking in billions of dollars. And, frankly, we're creating a lot of industry. But the rate goes from 10 percent to 25 percent on March 1st. So they would like to do it, and I'd like to accommodate them. If we can, I'd like to accommodate China if we can get the deal done.

It's a lot of work because this is a very comprehensive deal. This isn't what we're talking about, you know, they're going to buy some corn and that's going to be it. No, they're going to buy corn. Hopefully, they're going to buy lots of corn, and lots of wheat, and lots of everything else that we have. But they're also talking heavy technology, heavy manufacturing, financial services, and everything else.

Q So you may have to extend the talks beyond March the 1st? Is that what you're saying, sir?

THE PRESIDENT: I think we can do it by March 1st. Can you get it down on paper by March 1st? I don't know. I can say, on March 1st, the tariff on China goes to 25 percent, and that's a big tariff.

Q I'm just curious, what's the tone looking like for the State of the Union, sir? And then, I don't know if you've seen, the Democrats have tapped the rebuttal speech - Stacey Abrams, who ran for Governor of Georgia. Any thoughts on their pick, sir, or any of the messaging?

THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I campaigned against Stacey Abrams. I know that President Obama campaigned for her. Michelle Obama campaigned for her. And Oprah campaigned for her. And all Brian had was me. And he won fairly easily - you know, fairly easy.

So I hope that she does a good job. I mean, I respect her. I don't know her. I haven't met her. But I hope she does a good job.

Q And the tone for your speech, sir - can you tell us -

THE PRESIDENT: I think it's unification. I think it's industry. I think it's about the people that you see right here. It's also working with these people, because they've been incredible. We have had some incredible report. And we've have incredible Republican support.

The problem is, the Democrats - you know, when they say, 'We don't want to build…' - as an example, 'We don't want to build a wall because it doesn't work or because it's immoral.' Well, it's also immoral the people that come into our country that shouldn't be here and kill people. That's immoral, too. That's a lot more immoral.

So - but I really think it's doing to be a speech that's going to cover a lot of territory. But part of it is going to be unity.

Yeah, please.

Q Mr. President, Nancy Pelosi said this morning that there is not going to be a wall in this deal, but she did say she'd be open to other kinds of physical barriers. Would you accept that?

THE PRESIDENT: No, because if there's no wall, it doesn't work. She's just playing games. So if there's no wall, it doesn't work.

And we're building the wall right now. I mean, a lot of people don't know that, but we have a lot of wall under construction. We've given out a lot of contracts over the last three, four weeks - good contracts. A lot of wall is soon going to be under construction.

We will be - we're finishing up design on certain areas, the most important areas - the Rio Grande area and others. We are building a lot of wall. You know, I'm not waiting for this committee. And I've told a lot of people I don't expect much coming out of the committee because I keep hearing the words that, 'We'll give you what you want, but we're not going to give you wall.'

The problem is, if they don't give us a wall, it doesn't work. Without a wall, it doesn't work. We have caravans right now coming up from Honduras, who we give a lot of money to - which is stopping, by the way. But we pay hundreds of millions of dollars to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. And then they have caravans leaving their country, coming up here.

And, by the way, if you go to Tijuana and you take down that wall, you will have so many people coming into our country that Nancy Pelosi will be begging for a wall. She'll be begging for a wall. She will say, 'Mr. President, please, please give us a wall.' It'd be very interesting. Some people have suggested: Let me take the wall along California, let's move it to Arizona, let's move it to Texas. And, you know, it's going to - it would be a very interesting statement.

About Nancy: So, in California, they wanted the wall built in San Diego so badly. And we built it. And probably I should have waited, because as soon as it was finished, they started screaming, 'We don't want a wall. We don't want a wall.' But they wanted the wall so badly. And, by the way, it worked. Nobody is getting through.

But the minute it was built, they started saying, 'We don't want a wall.' Without a wall, it doesn't work. It's very simple. I mean, I'm not saying this as a Republican. I'm not saying it as anything other than a fact-stater. Without a wall, it just doesn't work.

Q Mr. President, after listening to the hardship from many federal government workers, as well as those who were contractors and who relied on the federal government employees' finances to fund their businesses, are you willing to jeopardize the economy again, and also your presidency, with people who are fearful of another government shutdown over this wall?

And also, I want to ask you about Jussie Smollett. Have you heard about that story? In Chicago, a situation - the actor from 'Empire' who was allegedly attacked with racist and homophobic -

THE PRESIDENT: That, I can tell you, is horrible. I've seen it last night. I think that's horrible. It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.

As far as the people are concerned, many of those people wanted me to stay out, but I didn't want to do it because people were getting hurt.

People - what I think is the worst sin of all is the fact that we're allowing people to come into this country and sell drugs and human traffic, and do all of these horrible things. That if we had the simplicity of a well-constructed, beautiful barrier or wall, they wouldn't be able to come into our country. That, to me, is the great sin. And everybody knows it works. I watched this morning, early in the morning, somebody trying to justify walls are immoral.

I mean, if walls are immoral, maybe we should take down all the walls that are built right now. You will see a mess like you've never seen before.

So I only say this: I was elected partially on this issue - not as much as people say, but partially on this issue. This is a very important issue. Nothing to do with elections. Nothing to do with votes. Nothing. Only to do with common sense and only to do with security. And if we don't put up a barrier or wall - a strong one, but one that looks good - in the old days, they used to build them; they looked terrible. Now we build them, they look really good.

If we don't put up a physical barrier, you can forget it. Our country is going to be a very unsafe place. People are coming in. Drugs are coming in. Human trafficking is coming in, which is so horrible. Things are happening that won't happen after the wall is constructed.

So we're building a lot of wall. We're building new sections that are starting in about two weeks. We're building some brand new sections - large sections. And the wall is getting built. I would like to build it even faster, but it's getting built, and it's getting built very substantially, as some of you see because you've been there.

Yeah, please.

Q I have an immigration question. But first, if I could just clarify something you said about North Korea. Do you have an agreement with North Korea on the time and place for that next summit?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes. I do.

Q Can you share it?

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we're going to very soon. We're going to announce it pretty soon. We'll be announcing it early next week.

Q Okay. And you also said that -

THE PRESIDENT: And they very much want the meeting, and I think they really want to do something. We'll see. But I think they really want.

But again, remember, North Korea was a whole different story. When I came to office, many people thought we were going to war with North Korea. I would sit and listen, and I would read people saying, 'Go to war with North Korea.' Well, you'd lose, I mean potentially, hundreds of millions of lives. You know, Seoul has 30-some-odd million people, and it's literally right off their wall, by the way. But that wall works, I can tell you.

Q About the wall, you just said that people make that out to be a bigger deal on your election than you -

THE PRESIDENT: Well, it was one of my points. I had - yeah.

Q I mean, you would consider that the biggest campaign -

THE PRESIDENT: Now they say it's the wall, because I've accomplished practically everything else. Look, I accomplished the military. I accomplished the tax cuts. I accomplished the regulation cuts. I accomplished so much. The economy is the number-one economy in the world. We're the number-one economy in the world. We're the number one, not even close. Companies are pouring into our country.

I've accomplished so much. So now they say, 'Oh, if he doesn't get the wall…' - they make that the only issue. But it's not going to work, because I'm building the wall. The wall is happening right now, okay?

Q The government has been reopened for several days now. Are you closer or farther apart on an immigration deal, now that - since you opened the government?

THE PRESIDENT: With respect to the committee?

Q Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: I would say we're the same. Because I'm hearing they don't want to do a wall, for political reasons. I actually think it's bad politics. I mean, frankly, I think them fighting us on what everybody knows has to be done to have proper security.

And you can add the other things, but the other things only really work if you have the physical barrier. Without the physical barrier, you just won't - what are you going to have? Drones flying over the 12,000 people? You're going to have a nice drone flying - doing circles around the 12,000 people that are walking in from Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador? No, you don't want that.

So I want to do real things, like the deal with China. I want it to be a real deal. I could do a deal with China, where people would say, 'Isn't that wonderful?' It's not wonderful. I have to do the real deal. We have to open up China. We're open to them. They have to be open to us.

So, it would be so easy for me to make a deal with China, but it wouldn't be a real deal. I could get them to buy more corn than they've ever bought, and more soybeans than they've ever bought. And they'd be so happy if I did that. But they're going to do that, but in even higher numbers. But we're going to do a lot of other things.

And just remember, we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from China. We never took in 10 cents from China. China is being charged tremendous amounts of money for the privilege of coming in and doing what they do to our country. They're being charged a tremendous amount of money. And we're going to make a deal. I think we're going to make a deal with China, but it's going to be a very comprehensive deal. We're going to cover everything, okay

Q You mentioned all the economic indicators are going up. Why then is the - are U.S. deficits and the financial debt increasing at a time when the economy is -

THE PRESIDENT: Well, the trade deals won't kick in for a while. You know, number one, the USMCA hasn't even been approved yet. It has to go before Congress and get approved. Now, it should get approved quickly. NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. During the campaign, I said I will either terminate NAFTA or negotiate a new deal. And we negotiated a good deal.

Now, if you went back to pre-NAFTA, that would be, frankly, okay with me. Pre-NAFTA or the new deal. But I won't allow NAFTA. NAFTA was a horrible deal for this country. If you look at the scars all over our country, where you go to New England, you go to Ohio, you go to Pennsylvania, you see what - I mean, what happened in North Carolina - you have factories that are still empty from what happened with NAFTA. NAFTA was a horrible deal. The USMCA is a great deal.

But pre-NAFTA was - we had huge surpluses with Mexico. With NAFTA, we have huge deficits. We lose $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico. Does that sound good? And this has been going on for many years. So I stopped it. I stopped it a lot.

Q One more on the wall. You said the wall is being basically held hostage for political reasons by the Democrats. Is there anything you would have done differently in the first two years to get this -

THE PRESIDENT: No, there's nothing - look, they had this from day one.

Q - (inaudible) wall finished -

THE PRESIDENT: Could I have done it differently? No, not really. I mean, I think what - by having the shutdown, we've set the table for where we are now. If I didn't do the shutdown, people wouldn't know - they wouldn't understand the subject. Now they understand the subject. They realize what a humanitarian crisis it is.

It's sort of - it's called, like in deal-making, 'setting the table,' or, you know, setting the stage. We've set the stage for what's going to happen on the 15th of February. I don't think they're going to make a deal. I see what's happening. They're all saying, 'Oh, let's do this, but we're not giving one dime for the wall.' That's okay. But if they're not going to give money for the wall, it's not going to work. And if it's not going to work, then the politicians are really wasting a lot of time.

Okay.

Q Mr. President, will you declare a national emergency if there's no money for the wall?

THE PRESIDENT: I would do that. I would do that.

Q So why hasn't -

THE PRESIDENT: We have money. Just so you understand: We have money. We're building the wall right now - a lot of it. People don't know that, and nobody reports it, but that's okay. Because it's not very exciting when you say it's built. You know, people.

But let me just tell you: We're building the wall right now. It's going up fairly rapidly. We're renovating tremendous amounts of wall, which is good stuff that's in very bad shape with massive holes in it and fencing coming down. It's being beautifully renovated. In some cases, we have to replace it. We renovate some. We replace some. We build some new. But the wall is going up right now in all different forms.

Thank you very much, everybody.

Q What's been holding you back from declaring a national emergency?

THE PRESIDENT: We're going to see what happens on February 15th.

Q Are you concerned about legal challenges?

THE PRESIDENT: Against who?

Q Are you concerned about legal challenges?

THE PRESIDENT: No, I'm not concerned. I'm not concerned.

Q But you still don't think there's going to be a deal, but you're not going to declare it now. Don't you think that -

THE PRESIDENT: I'm waiting - excuse me. I didn't say that. I said I'm waiting until February 15th. On February 15th, the committee will come back, and if they don't have a wall, I don't even want to waste my time reading what they have because it's a waste of time. Because the only thing that works for security and safety for our country is a wall.

Now, when you couple the wall with sensors and drones and all of these other things, that works, as a combination. But if you don't have a wall, they're all just wasting their time. It's just politics.

Thank you all very much.

By Don Babwin / Associated Press

CHICAGO — Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking in downtown Chicago before and after he says he was attacked by two masked men, including video of him arriving home with a rope around his neck, but they’re still searching for footage of the attack, a police spokesman said Thursday.

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett’s apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven’t found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett’s walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor was at home and recovering. Smollett’s family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying the actor was the victim of a “racial and homophobic hate crime” and pushing back against any suggestion that he was anything but truthful with the police.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn’t far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

In response to the public outcry that resulted from the incident, the Smollett Family wrote that their ""thanks [for] prayers and the huge amount of love he has received"" and said that ""Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.""

Chicago police confirmed that they were investigating the incident as a ""potential hate crime"" on Tuesday.

Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.

With love & gratitude,

Chicago police are investigating the alleged assault against Smollett, who is black and openly gay, as a possible hate crime. According to police, Smollett was attacked about 2 a.m. Tuesday by “two unknown offenders” who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown “chemical substance” on Smollett and wrapped a rope around his neck.

Surveillance footage released by police Wednesday shows two “people of interest” that investigators are now asking the public for help in identifying. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Wednesday that the video footage “does not capture an encounter.""

Smollett told police the attackers were male and dressed in black. One attacker was described as 5-foot-10 to 6-foot-1 and about 170 pounds, wearing a black mask to conceal his facial features. Police have not specified the race of the alleged attackers.

Police said Smollett is cooperating with the investigation. “He’s a victim right now, and we’ll treat him like a victim,"" Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson told Chicago’s ABC 7 in an interview Friday. “He’s been very cooperative and we have no reason, at this point, to think that he’s not being genuine with us.”

Smollett told detectives his attackers said “something to the effect of ‘This is MAGA country,’ ” an apparent reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, during the assault. Guglielmi said the initial police report did not reference those comments, but the actor recalled the information in a follow-up interview with detectives.

AD

On Thursday, Trump referred to reports of the attack as “horrible.” “It doesn’t get worse,” he said in response to a White House reporter’s question.

AD

The reported assault has drawn widespread attention and condemnation. Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.) sent a letter to the FBI director, writing that he was “disturbed” by the reports and was requesting a hate-crime investigation.

In their statement, the Smollett family drew attention to victims of hate crimes, which have increased in recent years, according to FBI data. “We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said, a theme Smollett reiterated in his own statement.

AD

""I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” Smollett added. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

AD

Smollett, 35, comes from a family of advocates and actors. As a child, he and his five siblings co-starred in the short-lived ABC sitcom “On Our Own.” According to a 2016 New York Times profile, Smollett and his sister, actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell (“Friday Night Lights,” “Underground”), have been involved with causes such as HIV/AIDS prevention, the push to end apartheid and the Black Lives Matter movement.

On Thursday, Smollett-Bell shared her family’s statement alongside a photo of herself, Smollett and their siblings.

AD

Smollett, whose role on “Empire” as Jamal Lyon is one of the few black, openly gay characters on network TV, has also done work with LGBTQ advocacy organizations including GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign. Both organizations released statements in support of the actor following reports of his assault.

AD

Smollett’s parents, Janet and Joel Sr., met in the San Francisco Bay area as they worked on civil rights causes. They associated with founders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Black Panther Party, according to the Times. (Joel Sr. died in 2015.)

In the statement, the family said they “will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”"

President Donald Trump commented on the 'horrible' attack on 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett, saying it 'doesn't get worse than that.'

The president was asked about the attack, which authorities are investigating as a possible hate crime, in the Oval Office on Thursday.

The president indicated he had been following the case.

'That I can tell you is horrible. I seen it last night. I can tell you it was horrible. It doesn't get worse than that and I mean it,' the president responded.

He was not asked directly about one key alleged detail of the incident.

Smollett, who allegedly was attacked on the way to his apartment after visiting a Subway sandwich shop, says his attackers shouted 'this is MAGA country!' during the incident.

The actor came out as gay in 2015, and says he attackers also doused him in an 'unknown chemical substance.' He says his attackers tied a noose around his neck.

MAGA is Trump's campaign slogan, 'Make America Great Again.'

Surveillance video shows Smollett walking down the same street as two people now considered 'persons of interest.'

One lawmaker, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who is a family friend of the actor and a favorite target of Trump's, is blaming Trump for contributing to the attack on the 35-year old actor.

'It doesn't get worse than that and I mean it,' President Donald Trump said when asked about the attack on Smollett

'Why all of a sudden do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have picnic while black, and being attacked?' Waters said.

'It's coming from the president of the United States. He's dog whistling every day.'

Smollett waited 40 minutes before a friend called 911 to report that he had been attacked outside his apartment building and was still wearing the rope his assailants placed around his neck when cops arrived.

The 36-year-old gay and black Empire actor was attacked 'some time' around 2am on East North Lower Water Street in Chicago as he walked home from a Subway sandwich shop by two men who called him racial and homophobic slurs.

But DailyMail.com can reveal that police were not called until at least 2.35am when an unnamed 'associate' called 911 on Smollett's behalf.

When police arrived at the luxury apartment building where he stays while filming the Fox show, Smollett had the rope he says was tied in a 'noose' around his neck by his attackers but it was slack, according to police.

He then took himself to hospital to be treated for cuts on his face.

It is not clear if the person who called 911 was his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, who says he was on the phone to him when the attack happened and corroborated his claim that the attackers shouted 'this is MAGA country!'.

When Chicago PD detectives asked Smollett for his cell phone to verify that he and Moore had been on the phone, he refused to hand it over.

'I don't know if it was a privacy issue or what,' police spokesman Anthony Guglieme said on Thursday morning.

The more detailed timeline emerged hours after a neighbor told TMZ that she saw a 'redneck' man loitering outside their apartment building at 12.30am - 90 minutes before the attack - while she took her dogs out.

'Photos (pictured) of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,' police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Wednesday evening

The men were not filmed attacking Smollett but were seen near where the attack took place at around the same time

DailyMail.com confirmed that the woman gave a statement to the police but detectives have not yet confirmed what she saw even though there are security cameras at the apartment complex.

Smollett was seen on surveillance cameras leaving the Subway and entering his building, purportedly after the attack, but police could not say on Thursday morning if he had the rope around his neck when he walked through the apartment doors.

Anthony Guglieme, a Chicago PD spokesman, said that while the area is 'saturated' with security cameras, there were several 'blind spots' that detectives were working to close in on

The unnamed neighbor told TMZ that she saw two men outside the building.

One had a piece of rope hanging out of his sweatshirt, she said.

'He looked out of place,' she said, describing him as a white man who was wearing a blue sweatshirt, a blue beanie and jeans that were too short and exposed 'thick grey hunting socks.'

Most notable was that the man, who she said was agitated and smoking a cigarette, was carrying a blue and white rope or 'clothesline' which was protruding out from his zip-up sweater.

There was another man about 300ft away, she said, nearer the entrance. The woman said she was 'creeped out' by the pair and went back inside after five minutes.

When she woke up at 4am, there was lots of security round the building, she said.

Once the concierge told her what had happened to 36-year-old Smollett, she relayed to him what she had seen.

The concierge implored her to phone the police, she said, which she did.

Her description came hours after Chicago Police Department released still images of two persons of interest.

The neighbor's version of events suggests that the two attackers were lying in wait for Smollett outside his apartment building.

Smollett and his manager Brandon Z. Moore both told police they were on the phone when the attack happened. Moore said he heard the attackers yell 'this is MAGA country'. It is not clear if he is the person who called 911 or if it was someone else but Smollett refused to hand over his phone when police asked for it to verify that they had been on the phone

Smollett had arrived back in Chicago late after having his flight from New York City delayed. The star lives in Chicago while filming the Fox series Empire.

He was in New York for a reading of the play Take Me Out, which tells the story of a gay baseball player.

Before he flew back to Chicago, he posted on Instagram about the delayed flight and about a show he is set to perform on Saturday night in Los Angeles.

The exact spot where he was attacked sits in between two luxury apartment buildings and two hotels but police say they have not recovered any surveillance footage of it.

A week before he was attacked, the star received a death threat letter at the network's studio but turned down security because he found it 'intrusive'.

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

The release of the surveillance photos comes just hours after officers said they were unable to find an footage that showed two men attacking the actor.

Officers said that detectives reviewed CCTV video of Smollett walking to his apartment building in downtown Chicago Tuesday morning, and 'for the most part' they can confirm the route he took when he says he was accosted by the assailants.

Authorities said a community alert with photos is being constructed and will be disseminated shortly.

Guglielmi said detectives investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have already looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area.

Officers expanded the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the crime scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

The attack took place here, in the street, outside the apartment building where Smollett stays while he is in Chicago filming. It is in between two luxury apartment buildings and two hotels but police say they have not yet recovered surveillance footage of it

Smollett is due to perform on Saturday in Los Angeles

'We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn't find a container anywhere,' Guglielmi said earlier on Wednesday, referring to a container for the liquid that was thrown at the actor.

Smollett has not commented since the incident

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the US, with thousands of CCTV cameras mounted on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

The letter threatening Smollett was sent to the Fox studio on January 22 and was laced with a powdery substance believed to be Tylenol.

The FBI is now trying to determine if there's a link between the homophobic letter and the Tuesday attack.

Following the accident Fox has added security for the rest of the Empire cast.

Much of the cast live in Chicago during filming.

Smollett missed shooting on the set on Tuesday as he recovered from the brutal attack.

He reportedly still intends to return to the set and Empire will resume as planned.

The production has halted filming in Chicago due to the severe cold weather and not because of what happened to Smollett.

20th Century Fox released a statement confirming the incident earlier in the week which read: 'We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night.

'We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

'The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.'"

As we mark the start of Black History Month, HRC honors the ways in which Black LGBTQ and allied trailblazers have been and continue to be at the center of the fight for equality, breaking down barriers every day. In this moment in our country’s history, our community must draw strength and inspiration from the commitment, tenacity and resilience of civil rights leaders who made our work possible.

In the last month, we have seen pro-equality champions sworn into office, including Gwen Moore, Colin Allred, Garlin Gilchrist, Lucy McBath, Steven Horsford, Lauren Underwood, Aaron Ford, Mandela Barnes and Ayanna Pressley. They will continue their justice work, advocating for equality from statehouses to the halls of Congress.

They join champions such as Andrea Jenkins, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elijah Cummings, Maxine Waters and John Lewis, tireless champsions of racial justice and LGBTQ equality in our towns, cities and nation’s capital.

We celebrate revolutionary shows like Pose, which brings the stories of Black, Afro-Caribbean and Latinx LGBTQ people during the tumultuous 1980s into our homes. Pose is helmed by a cast and crew of queer and transgender trailblazers, including HRC honorees Angelica Ross and Billy Porter, Janet Mock, MJ Rodriguez, Dominique Jackson and Steven Canals. Mock made history by becoming the first transgender woman of color to both write, produce and direct for a major network television show.

Artists including Janelle Monáe, Shea Diamond and Jussie Smollett give voice to the stories of the Black LGBTQ community through their music. They challenge us to name the ways that racism intersects with homophobia, biphobia and transphobia -- and to confront the ways these intersecting oppressions deprive LGBTQ people of color of the tools needed to live and thrive.

“I think the most rewarding thing I can do is speak to the times now,” Diamond said in an interview with HRC. “If you listen to your favorite song right now, 20 years from now, would the next generation know that we were struggling and still fighting for rights? Would they know that trans women were being killed at the rate they were being killed?”

We pause to remember and honor our history and those who made today’s victories possible. This year marks 50 years since LGBTQ patrons of Stonewall, led by Black trans women Marsha P. Johnson and Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, decided to take a stand and fight back against the brutal intimidation they regularly faced at the hands of police.

While we celebrate the progress we have made in these 50 years, it is more important than ever to recognize the distance we still have to go to achieve full equality. From turning out to elect pro-equality champions and hosting service projects to empowering HBCU students to become leaders in their campuses and communities, HRC staff, volunteers, members and supporters are on the ground working to drive this country forward at the intersections of LGBTQ equality and racial justice.

This Black History Month, we celebrate the barriers that have broken, recognize the barriers that remain and lift up the voices of Black and LGBTQ advocates challenging systems of power and oppression everyday. We deepen our commitment to those in our community who are still too often at its margins as we work to move equality forward."

Incidentally, President Trump also commented on the attack Thursday, speaking to the White House press pool in the Oval Office. According to Politico, Trump called the violence “horrible” and said, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.” He did not, however, comment on Smollett’s claim that the assailants said, “This is MAGA country.”"

Rumors have been circulating online that it was a “hook up gone wrong” or Smollett just made up the story for attention. In addition, the Chicago Police Department has released information to the press that has changed within hours.

Now, Smollett’s family has broken their silence.

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,” a statement from the family read in part. “Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

The statement continued, “We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.”

More leaks have come out from the Chicago Police Department saying the 36-year-old actor will not give him their cell phone, but it’s not unusual for victims to not want to give their property to police.

On Tuesday, while walking to a Subway in Chicago, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor after he exited a restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Threatening letters directed at Smollett were reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago last week. The cutout letters said, “You will die black f**.” See below:

And they appear to have taken a shot at President Donald Trump in the process.

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack,"" the family said to open its message, adding:

""We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""

According to Smollett, he was attacked by two men who hurled racial and homophobic epithets in his direction.

The men also screamed that he was in ""MAGA country.""

They then punched and kicked Smollett, fracturing his ribs, prior to tying a rope around his neck and pouring bleach all over him.

As many have noted, this really was the equivalent of a modern-day lynching.

This is how the statement continued:

Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time.

We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.

Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country.

Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.

They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable.

As far as we know at the moment, Smollett is in stable condition.

Moreover, we now have photos of the two suspects.

Because the assailants referenced ""MAGA,"" the shorthand for President Trump's slogan of Make America Great Again, many folks had been waiting for Trump to address the awful incident.

He finally did so on Thursday afternoon.

“That I can tell you is horrible,” Trump says when asked about it in the following video. “I’ve seen it. Last night. It’s horrible. Doesn’t get worse.”

He does not, however, say anything specific about the ""MAGA"" taunt directed at Smollett.

To conclude their statement it certainly, Jussie's family certainly appears to call out the President and a lot of his hateful rhetoric over the years.

""Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world,"" the statement concluded.

""With love & gratitude, the Smollett Family.""

In related news, Smollett is expected to return to work in the near future.

As soon as he is medically cleared, the actor will be back filming new episodes of Empire.

We wish him all the best."

Jussie Smollett was ‘brutally beaten’ in Chicago earlier this week, with police investigating it as a ‘possible hate crime’.

The Empire actor was reportedly set upon by two men in ski masks, who ‘beat him up, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him’.

TMZ states his attackers screamed out ‘this is MAGA country’ before running away.

And the 35-year-old’s family have broken their silence on his ordeal, branding it an ‘inhumane act of domestic terrorism’.

‘These are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.

‘We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme.’

Jussie landed in Chicago on Monday night, and headed out for food in the early hours of Tuesday morning when he was reportedly approached by the two men.

Sources told the publication the men in question asked him: ‘Aren’t you that f****t Empire n*****?’ before beating him, ‘putting a rope around his neck and pouring bleach on him’.

The actor – who plays Jamal Lyon in the series – attempted to fight them off, but they overpowered him. He was later taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment, and was found to have fractured a rib.

A spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department said they are investigating the incident as battery, and treating it ‘as a possible hate crime’.

And an insider told TMZ Jussie still had the noose around his neck when he got in touch with police, at 2:42am.

Empire producers are now taking extra precautions to protect actors with filming reportedly continuing on the Fox series in Chicago under the protection of armed security staff.

Several of the actors are said to be ‘extremely upset’ by the news, while boss Lee Daniels shared a public video urging Jussie to ‘hold his head up’.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Donald Trump Jr., the president’s firstborn child and namesake, is essentially a walking QAnon message board brought to life and given a (vaguely) human-shaped form. And on Thursday, he focused that razor-sharp Trump intellect on what’s become the latest scandal du jour for the internet’s assortment of cranks, conspiracy mongers, and racists: The alleged attempted lynching of Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

Here are just a few Tweets Donj liked or shared today:

Police have launched an investigation into who allegedly beat Smollett, tied a noose around his neck, and doused him with bleach, while reportedly screaming “this is MAGA country!” this past Tuesday night. And while Donj hasn’t explicitly said himself that he thinks the attack—which left Smollett hospitalized—was fake, he sure seems awfully interested in the people who seem to believe it is.

The president, meanwhile, has weighed in on the attack, calling it “horrible” and saying “it doesn’t get any worse.”

The FBI is reportedly helping Chicago PD in their hunt for the people behind Smollett’s attack. And as is his family’s way, I’m sure Trump Jr. will gladly accept their eventual conclusions. Right?"

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent? And at different moments...you're seeing the yin and yang of that, the positive and negative of both. Both are just trying to love this child."

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett’s apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven’t found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett’s walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Meanwhile, police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose images police released to the public late Wednesday. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have information that could be useful to the investigation.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn’t far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

Chuck Hodes/FOX(CHICAGO) — The family of Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who was attacked in Chicago on Tuesday in what’s being investigated as a hate crime, is finally speaking out about the brutal incident.

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,” the statement reads.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

The family then goes on to thank everyone for their prayers and support, calling Jussie “a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.”

The statement also asks that similar “targeted hate crimes” be called “domestic terrorism.. and treated as such.”

While the family is calling for accountability, police have thus far received no tips since releasing surveillance footage photos.

However, Chicago police did confirm to ABC News on Thursday that a female neighbor of Smollett’s came forward to say that she’d seen a man who had a rope of some kind, although the man’s description was different than the one Smollett gave of his attacker.

Police also note that Smollett is a victim, not the target of any criminal investigation. Regarding the fact that the actor didn’t want to turn over his personal phone after the attack for independent verification, police say they have no interest or probable cause to obtain a warrant to search his phone records.

As previously reported, Smollett, who’s openly gay, says he was attacked by two men who hurled racial and homophobic epithets at him, threw an unknown substance on him and put a rope around his neck. He also claimed the assailants used the phrase “MAGA country.”

However, in the Trump administration, the worse job you do, the more you are rewarded. Therefore, Carson will now be in charge of the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), CBS News reported.

God help those residents.

Carson met with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio Thursday.

“The families who have endured unimaginably poor housing conditions deserve better from their housing authority,” Carson said. “Today we are presenting NYCHA residents with bold new solutions for decades-old problems.”

De Blasio responded positively to the news.

“What we have done here today creates a strong path forward, a tangible path forward,” the mayor said. “It will change and improve the lives of public housing residents. We wanted to make sure there would be results.”

CBS News reported: “As part of the agreement, New York City will commit at least $2.2 billion in funding over the next 10 years to address the housing authority issues. HUD will continue to provide funding to NYCHA, estimated to be $1.5 billion this year.”

A federal monitor will be hired as part of the deal.

“Now they want a monitor? NYCHA already has monitors — its residents who have suffered from decades of disinvestment,” New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said. “They’re the parents who sought help when their child got lead poisoning. The grandmother who has to huddle near a stove when it’s colder inside her apartment than outside. And the family dealing with health issues because of rampant mold in their home.”

He continued, “The time for talk and political stunts is over. Cut the long overdue check from the federal government to fully fund the needed repairs, listen to the real NYCHA monitors, put a plan in place, and get to work.”

Back in December, the New York Daily News reported almost the entire city congressional delegation were fighting “against placing the city’s troubled Housing Authority into federal receivership.”

Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-Brooklyn, wrote in a letter, “Although there’s no easy answer here, the one thing that should be a nonstarter is a Trump takeover of NYCHA, which could lead to the selling of assets and tenant displacement without any local input.”

She continued, “Certainly, additional resources are needed from all levels of government — including federal, state and local — as is a comprehensive review of NYCHA operations and personnel. But, we can’t enable a situation that results in the Trump administration essentially holding a fire sale of NYCHA assets.”

Carson has been feuding with NYCHA since he was appointed secretary. The former doctor has been upset with funding going to NYCHA.

“We don’t want to do it that way, but they forced us into doing it that way until they become more responsible,” he told the Wall Street Journal in April.

In case you forgot, here are just some of Carson failures: He was accused of demoting an employee for not approving extravagant office renovations, including a $31,000 dining room set. There are accusations his family was too involved at HUD, emails proving he has lied and even reports of Carson using taxpayer money for private planes. In addition, there were Obama-era policies that would help people out of poverty, which he ended.

Prayers up for the people living in New York City Housing Authority.

Police Release Photos of ‘Persons of Interest’ in Attack

CHICAGO—Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said on Jan. 30.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

FBI experts will try to enhance the images to bring out more detail.

Police say two people yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance believed to be bleach on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

Another security camera shows Smollett returning home with the rope still around his neck.

Smollett's manager told police he was on the phone with his client and heard the attack go down. He says he heard the racial slurs and the shout, “This is MAGA country,” but both Smollett and his manager reportedly refused to hand over their phones to investigators.

President Trump says the attack on Smollett is ""horrible.""

He was asked about the attack in the Oval Office Thursday following claims that the assailants shouted ""This is MAGA country.”

“That I can tell you is horrible. I've seen it last night. It doesn't get worse, as far as I am concerned,” he said.

Smollett's family issued a statement Thursday afternoon calling the attack an act of ""domestic terrorism,"" adding, ""this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed.""

(CNN) A letter containing a white powder was sent to the Chicago set of ""Empire"" days before one of the show's stars, Jussie Smollett, was allegedly attacked by two men on January 29.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CNN that the letter, received on January 22 at Cinespace Studios, where the show is filmed, prompted a response from the HAZMAT unit.

Guglielmi said authorities determined the powder to be aspirin, but declined to give details on the content of the letter.

The FBI is leading the investigation into the letter, he added.

A spokesperson for 20th Century Fox Entertainment, which produces the series, declined to comment when reached by CNN.

“We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive,” it reads. “Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.”

Smollett says he was attacked by two men early Tuesday on the way to Subway. They assaulted him, poured bleach on him, and put his head in a noose. While the family’s statement doesn’t contain any further details about the incident that sent Smollett to a Chicago hospital, they note that the alleged hate crime is not an anomaly for Black LGBTQ+ people.

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings,” they wrote, “many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable.”

Chicago police are investigating the attack as a hate crime. They released surveillance photos Wednesday evening of two “persons of interest” that they’d like to interview.

Read the full family statement below:

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time.

Earlier today, the actor’s family broke their silence and spoke about the attack against their son that happened in the early hours of the morning this past Tuesday in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood. According to TMZ, the family shared their outrage and clapped back at those who think that Jussie “faked” the attack in a brief statement to the media outlet. To start the statement, the family defends Jussie and says that he has never changed his story about the night of the attack, instead insisting that he is indeed the victim of a hate crime.

“Hateful words lead to hateful actions. This was a racial, homophobic hate crime… We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings.”

“These are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such,” the statement continues. “We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme.”

As it was reported, Smollett was reportedly subjected to racist and homophobic insults during the attack while two masked men threw an unknown chemical substance at him. Additionally, the men put a rope around his neck before they fled the scene and there is also a surveillance video of Jussie walking into his apartment building with a rope around his neck. Additionally, there is also a video of two masked men walking in the area of the attack about 15-20 minutes before and police are trying to locate those two individuals for questioning.

Since the news of the attack broke, many fans and celebrities have been speaking out. As the Inquisitr reported, Kevin Hart received a little bit of backlash for being a “hypocrite” after he sent his support for Jussie on Twitter. Along with a photo of the Empire actor, Hart wished him well in what seemed to be a heartfelt tweet.

“Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett….This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better,” Hart wrote before telling his Twitter followers that we should choose love instead of choosing hate.

But since his comments on Smollett’s situation, he has received a lot of backlash from fans just as he did during his Oscar fiasco. Variety also shared that Donald Trump spoke about the attack when he was asked about it during a press conference this afternoon.

“I can tell you that it’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” Trump told reporters.

Smollett checked himself into Northwestern Hospital after the attack and the actor is listed in “good condition.”"

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett’s apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven’t found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects, he said.

Smollett, who is black, gay and Jewish and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett’s walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Meanwhile, police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose images police released to the public late Wednesday. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have information that could be useful to the investigation.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

US President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn’t far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGT issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

Smollett told police he was attacked early this past Tuesday morning in Chicago as he left a sandwich shop.

The actor is alleging that two men confronted him and made racist and homophobic comments — Smollett is a gay man. Smollett also alleged the men poured an unknown chemical substance on him and that they tried to put a rope around his neck.

He was later admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital and was released; he had lacerations on his face, according to reports.

Though his initial statement to police made no mention of the president, it was during a follow-up interview with detectives that Smollett said the two men yelled “MAGA country” while attacking him — a reference, it appears, to the president’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Police have been investigating the alleged attack as a possible hate crime.

“In the initial reports there was no mention of MAGA,” a police statement to People reads. “When detectives [followed] up with [Smollett] later in the day, he recalled the offenders making those comments and detectives completed a supplemental report.”

Smollett is reportedly now in “good condition.”

The alleged attack is now under investigation by the FBI after it was discovered Smollett also received a threatening letter a week before the alleged assault.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police said in a public statement. “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.”

Local authorities on Wednesday night released images captured by a surveillance camera, but so far, no arrests have been made, according to reports.

Police say they’re reviewing additional cameras. “Now that we’ve got potential persons of interest, the focus will be following their paths. Where did they come from and where did they go?” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Chicago Tribune.

Police have yet to find footage of the alleged attack itself, but they’re continuing to search. They’re even reportedly looking to question other people who have been seen in surveillance cameras around where Smollet said the attack took place.

“Chicago police say detectives want to talk to the people seen on surveillance. They are not calling them suspects. Because there is an allegation of a hate crime, a community alert will be issued,” ABC7 Chicago reporter Rob Elgas said on social media on Wednesday.

In a statement issued on Thursday, the Empire star's family referred to Smollett as ""a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed,"" and described what happened to him as ""a racial and homophobic hate crime.""

According to ABC News, Smollett — who is black and openly gay — was walking in Chicago early Tuesday when someone allegedly shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. Citing the Chicago Police Department, ABC News reported that two men allegedly attacked Smollett by pouring ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him and wrapping a rope around his neck.

Smollett reportedly told police that his attackers had shouted ""MAGA country"" during the incident. His music manager, who was reportedly on the phone with him during the attack, told Variety that he ""clearly"" heard the words ""MAGA country"" being used, as well as a racial slur. According to TMZ, the two men who allegedly attacked Smollett were both white and wearing ski masks.

Chicago police are reportedly investigating the attack as a ""possible hate crime,"" Politico reported, and have identified two persons of interest, per ABC News. The attack on Smollett swiftly sparked widespread outrage, with celebrities and lawmakers alike expressing solidarity. Singer Cher condemned the attack as an example of ""villainy, racism, and homophobia,"" while California Rep. Maxine Waters slammed the ""homophobic haters"" who attacked him.

On Thursday, Smollett's family released the following statement, in which they expressed their gratitude for his safety and called for his attackers to be brought to justice:

In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.

Following the attack, the Chicago Police Department released photos of two persons of interest, and have requested the public's help in identifying them."

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett's apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven't found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor ""is at home and recovering.""

Meanwhile, police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose images police released to the public late Wednesday. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have information that could be useful to the investigation.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

U.S. President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

Smollett, who is best known for his role on Fox's Empire, was assaulted by two men who used racist and homophobic language against him, in addition to tying a noose around his neck and pouring bleach on the actor.

In response to the public outcry that resulted from the incident, the Smollett Family wrote that their ""thanks [for] prayers and the huge amount of love he has received"" and said that ""Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.""

The Smollett Family also addressed the controversy surrounding whether the incident should be deemed a hate crime saying, ""We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""

Chicago police confirmed that they were investigating the incident as a ""potential hate crime"" on Tuesday.

In a statement first released by MSNBC's Michael Del Moro, the family opened up about how the actor is doing after the brutal attack and presented a call to action for people to be kinder to others.

""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack,"" the statement began.

""We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Just has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" they wrote, before thanking fans and other celebrities who have spoken out and sent messages of support to Jussie following the incident.

They continued: ""We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.""

The family also noted that the tragic attack against the singer and actor is not uncommon in America, writing: ""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.""

After expressing their warning that attacks like this will continue to happen until Americans start to hold each other accountable, the family went on to say that it starts with hateful words.

""Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall,"" they wrote. ""We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.""

The statement comes a few hours after President Donald Trump commented on the brutal hate crime for the first time himself, with a quick comment for reporters.

""That, I can tell, is horrible. I've seen it. Last night. I think that's horrible. It doesn't get worse as fas I'm concerned,"" he said Thursday morning.

Police recently released photos of two persons of interest in the case, who could provide information on the attack, which saw two masked individuals beat the actor in the early hours of Tuesday morning, tying rope around his neck and throwing bleach on his face. Jussie reportedly told police the suspects yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him during the attack, and referenced ""Make America Great Again"" as they ran away.

Despite the attack, Smollett will be performing a concert in Los Angeles Saturday as scheduled."

The Chicago Police Department is investigating an attack against Smollett, who is black and gay, on Tuesday morning as a hate crime.

Smollett told police that two assailants who attacked him were yelling racist and homophobic slurs. He also said they tied a thin rope around his neck.

Chicago police said Wednesday that they had not yet found footage proving the details of the attack given by Smollett.

On Thursday the department said Smollett refused to turn his cellphone over to detectives, NBC News reports. Call records could confirm that he was on the phone with his manager when the altercation occurred.

His manager told police he heard assaulters yell ""this is MAGA country,"" officials said.

TMZ broke the news that Trump is speaking out about — the allegedly vicious attack which lead Smollett to seek treatment at a city hospital. Complex reports that the attack left Jussie Smollett with a fractured rib.

A reporter in the Oval Office asked Trump about the attack on the Empire actor, one who is openly gay.

“That I can tell you is horrible. I’ve seen it… last night. It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

Smollett reported that he was taunted by two men who beat him, doused him with bleach, and placed a rope tied as a noose around his neck before asserting that this was “MAGA country.”

Supporters of the talented actor and singer, like Reverend Al Sharpton, say that Donald Trump needs to specifically denounce the attackers and the attack –saying that this is unacceptable. Sharpton says that the attack on Smollett is a hate crime personified.

“This is hate on steroids.”

Donald Trump has a history of controversial reactions to alleged examples of racism in the news, per the Inquisitr. When asked about the recent condemnation of Rep. Steve King for racist statements made to the New York Times, Trump stated that he was not following the story.

When the Charlottesville riots resulted in the death of a “No Hate” protester by a man affiliated with the White Nationalist march, Trump stated that there were “good people on both sides” of the conflict — therefor, many skeptics have been waiting to hear what the president has to say about a purported hate crime attack on Jussie Smollett.

Award-winning journalist Jemele Hill stated on a recent podcast that she thought it was widely understood that Trump was a racist. She said it was a given, like water is wet.

She said, for clarity, that Trump is “a bigot, unqualified, and unfit.”

Other journalists — like ABC’s Jonathan Karl — have pointed out that there are no prominent people of color in the West Wing of the White House.

“What does that say to have not a single senior adviser in the West Wing who is African American?”

The media and Trump’s critics wait to see if the president will make further remarks on the issue."

Days before the reported homophobic and racist attack against Jussie Smollett, he was offered around-the-clock bodyguards.

As TMZ reports, the Empire actor denied Fox Studio’s offer to provide him with additional offset security detail while in Chicago filming the series, after images of a threatening letter with the phrase, “You will die black fag” were released.

The studio temporarily suspended production on the series, now in its fifth season. Despite the timing, the suspension wasn’t in relation to Smollett’s attack, but due to Chicago’s inclement weather during the polar vortex, per E! Online.

The Chicago Police Department and FBI are still currently investigating the incident. At this point, all we can do is speculate (or, choose to stay mum and await facts), but this report does highlight an interesting phenomenon to examine.

Learning that this incident could’ve been avoided, had extra security been on hand when Smollett was outside at a vulnerable time of night, could be an upsetting revelation for those who care for him.

Apparently, Smollett’s decision was due to the intrusive nature of having 24/7 security detail.

Certainly, the conspiracy theories around the validity of Smollett’s attack only exemplifies the argument for more boundaries by celebrities and public figures. If every move they make will be scrutinized, when do they get to have a space that is exclusively their own? And at the same time, because they are public, their (valid) demand for some personal space can also come at a risk. It’s a Catch-22, indeed.

Maybe being left alone is the key here. And that goes for both potential attackers and the extra-scrutinizing audience.

Due to the heightened risk now clearly presented here, though, Empire production sources told TMZ the actor-singer will have 24/7 security detail, after all."

Early Tuesday morning, Smollett was targeted by two offenders who began yelling slurs at him on a Chicago street, according to a report from the Chicago Police Department. The assailants then became physically violent, battering Smollett with their hands, wrapping a rope around his neck and pouring a chemical substance on him before fleeing the scene.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the actor told police that the offenders “yelled pro-‘Make America Great Again’ [MAGA] comments” during the attack. (On Thursday afternoon, President Trump called the incident “horrible.”)

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,” the statement from Smollett’s family reads. “Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice… We are so grateful that God saw [Smollett] through this cowardly attack alive.”

The statement goes on to offer support to “our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities,” who have frequently become the targets of “inhumane acts of domestic terrorism.”

There is also evidence to suggest that the attack on Smollett was premeditated. According to a report from That Grape Juice, Smollett had previously received an anonymous death threat in the mail, in which a drawing of him getting shot was accompanied by his name and a homophobic slur.

“Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions,” the Smollett family’s statement continues. “Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall.”

The 35-year-old was attacked in Chicago around 2 a.m., with the offenders reportedly battering the victim with their hands before pouring an unknown chemical substance on him.

They were also said to have wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene.

Celebs have since taken to social media in droves to voice their support, with the star’s family now releasing a heartfelt statement to ET Canada.

The message read: “In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning.”

“His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time.”

""We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the statement said.

The statement comes as Chicago Police tell Fox News they continue to sift through hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in the high-end area of downtown Chicago where the alleged incident occurred on Tuesday morning but they still haven't found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

The Smollett family thanked everyone for their support and concluded: ""We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country.

We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.""

Smollett, who is African-American and gay and plays the openly gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, told police he was beaten by two men who subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope was draped around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

'EMPIRE' ACTOR JUSSIE SMOLLETT HOSPITALIZED AFTER ATTACK; POLICE INVESTIGATING AS POSSIBLE HATE CRIME

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the timestamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he explained.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor and his manager declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Meanwhile, police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose images police released to the public late Wednesday. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have information that could be useful to the investigation.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

President Donald Trump expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

Chicago police are in search of two men after Smollett was attacked in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood on Tuesday. Two men approached the “Empire” star yelling racist and homophobic slurs and “began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” according to police. Police also said one of the attackers put a rope around his neck.

Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.”

On Wednesday, the Chicago police department released photos from a surveillance video showing “potential persons of interest” in the case. The photos showed two silhouettes walking in the area of where Smollett was sometime between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m., but did not show the actual attack.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that CPD was “taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.”

The case has brought an outpouring of love for Smollett and widespread condemnation of the attack, though some have objected to the police description of the incident as a “possible hate crime.” However, a Chicago police officer said police routinely use the word “possible” in cases when the an investigation is not yet complete.

The Chicago Police have confirmed that Smollett was attacked in the early hours of January 29 having just returned to the very cold Windy City on a delayed flight from NYC. the actor was hit over and over and had an unknown chemical substance that we’ve been told was bleach poured over him. The attackers also reportedly put a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene.

After reporting the assault to police and conducting an initial interview with them, Smollett drove himself to Northwestern Hospital. He returned to his home under increased security later Tuesday and was said to be in good condition, police said.

Empire co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong as well as Fox have offered strong words of support for Smollett, who plays the openly gay Jamel Lyon on the primetime series. The show shut down for production yesterday due to the harsh cold covering the MidWest but Empire is filming today, as Deadline reported earlier.

Late Wednesday, Chicago PD released released video surveillance images of what they call “people of interest” in the January 29 attack on Smollett. Earlier this week, the police said that they were treating the incident as a “possible hate crime.”

There are no briefings set for today from the police’ chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi on Thursday in what he now referred to as an “assault and battery case.”

Police have confirmed that a rope was put around Empire star Jussie Smollett's neck when he was attacked in Chicago.

Cops have told TMZ that the assault was caught on a building surveillance camera.

The black, gay actor, who plays Jamal Lyon in the programme, was brutally assaulted by two men in what is believed to have been a homophobic and racist attack.

Jussie was walking in Chicago at 2am when he was allegedly beaten by two men who put his head in a noose and screamed ""This is MAGA country"".

Sources close to the star said he had arrived in Chicago from New York late on Monday night and decided to head out at 2am to get some food.

It's said he'd gone into a Subway store and when he walked out, someone shouted: ""Aren't you that f****t Empire n****r?""

The two men, who were both wearing ski masks, are said to have viciously attacked Jussie, beating him so badly that he fractured a rib.

Jussie was taken to Northwestern Memorial hospital where he was treated and discharged the following morning.

Now, a woman who lives in Jussie's apartment building told police she saw a suspicious man, who she said looked like a ""redneck"", loitering outside the entrance

The unnamed woman told the site she left the building at 12.30am to take her dogs out and saw a man near the door, pacing between the parking garage and the entrance.

She said he looked agitated and was smoking a cigarette, adding that he looked ""out of place""

The woman described the man as white and with scruff on his face and said he was wearing a blue winter beanie, blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood and blue jeans that were too short, exposing ""thick, grey hunting socks"" with camel-coloured dress shoes.

She also said that she noticed what appeared to be a rope or a clotheslines, made of white and blue material, sticking out from the bottom of his sweatshirt.

The woman said the man was staring at another man standing outside another entrance to the building about 300 feet away.

She says she went back into the building after five minutes and woke up at 4am to go to the gym and noticed a lot of security.

She says the concierge told her about Jussie being attacked and she passed on what she had seen, with the staff member uring her to contact the police.

Police have released images of two persons of interest, but it is not known if one of them is the man the woman saw.

Officers had been checking footage of the area and say they have video of Jussie with rope draped around his neck as he walks through the lobby of his building."

(Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty)

Donald Trump has finally condemned a “horrible” attack on Emprie star Jussie Smollett, amid allegations that the attackers shouted a pro-Trump slogan and racist, homophobic slurs.

Out TV star Smollett, who plays a high-profile gay character on Fox show Empire was attacked in the early hours of Tuesday (January 29) in Chicago.

The actor was hospitalised after the violent incident, in which he was reportedly branded a “faggot Empire n****r” and had a noose tied around his neck by two men.

Smollett told Chicago Police that the attackers shouted homophobic and racist abuse, as well as the acronym ‘MAGA’, which stands for the pro-Trump slogan “Make America Great Again.”

ThatGrapeJuice, the first outlet to report the attack, further alleged that a threatening letter also repeating ‘MAGA’ alongside the phrase “You will die black fag.”

Trump pivots away from question over Jussie Smollett attack

Despite calls for him to disavow the attack, the President has been silent on the issue for two days, but finally condemned it in a press briefing on Thursday (January 31).

Pressed on the issue by American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan, he said: “That I can tell you is horrible. I’ve seen it last night, I think that’s horrible, It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

The President then immediately pivoted to talking about the US government shutdown, continuing: “As far as the people are concerned, many of the people wanted me to stay out, but I didn’t want to do it because people were getting hurt.

“What I think is the worst sin of all is the fact that we’re allowing people to come into this country and sell drugs and human traffic, that if we had the simplicity of a wall, they wouldn’t be able to come in.

“That to me is a great sin.”

White House had been silent on Jussie Smollett attack despite reported ‘MAGA’ link

Trump’s comments is the first response issued by any White House official, with the two-day silence from the Trump administration leading to criticism.

Many Democratic leaders rushed to condemn the attack in the wake of the incident, while some campaigners highlighted the reported pro-Trump epithet.

Civil rights campaigner and former Obama adviser Al Sharpton told TMZ: “If, in fact, they said [MAGA] then it ought to be denounced by the President, the author and main proselytiser of ‘Make American Great Again’.

“I don’t hold the President responsible, but since he tweets about everything else, he should tweet the disassociation that his slogan would have with this.

“His silence would be very, very deafening.”

In their messages of support, Booker and Harris urged their fellow politicians to pass the anti-lynching bill they co-sponsored in the Senate.

Booker, a New Jersey Senator, tweeted: “The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe.

“To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime–I urge you to pay attention.”

Harris, who is seeking to challenge Trump in 2020, said: “Jussie Smollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery.

“This was an attempted modern-day lynching. No-one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or colour of their skin. We must confront this hate.”"

8:20 PM PT: -- Jussie's famous sister, actress Jurnee Smollett Bell, just broke her silence on her brother's attack.

""Because there’s a light in him that cannot be dimmed, because we are a family of joyful warriors, we will not let this get the best of us,"" she wrote along with posting a family photo. ""Although this is a picture from happier times, this is the spirit to which we chose to move forward...they will not steal, our joy.""

The family of Jussie Smollett is speaking out following the attack this week against the ""Empire"" star.

""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack,"" the statement began. ""We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.""

They continued, ""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""

The family went on to say, ""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender nonconforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Often times ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable.""

The Smollets concluded by saying, ""Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and injustice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.""

On Wednesday night, police released a photo of the potential suspects, which shows two men wearing dark clothing. Detectives are reviewing more camera, but are looking to question the two individuals seen in the photo.

Police say the two people were seen walking near the location of the incident between 1:30 AM and 1:45 AM and are trying to determine if they witnessed the incident, or were possibly involved.

As we reported, police have been combing the area near Smollett’s luxury high-rise apartment ever since he claims to have been attacked in a racial and homophobic-fueled tirade.

Jussie Smollett was seen with a cut under his eye after video chatting with “Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels. The star also claims a noose was put around his neck and bleach thrown at his face during the early morning assault.

Police make it clear they want to speak with the two people seen in the video, but they have not yet been identified.

5. Police Have Released Images of Persons of Interest in Smollett’s Alleged Assault

On January 30, police in Chicago released images of persons wanted for questioning in relation to the assault on Smollett. Public safety group CWB Chicago tweeted in response to the release of the photos, “A consideration regarding the ‘potential persons of interest’ being sought by police in connection with reported hate crime incident in Streeterville: The men are walking *away* from the attack scene 15-30 minutes *before* the incident, per police timing of events.” Police were called to Smollett’s friend’s apartment around 2:30 a.m. on January 29 by a friend of the actor. It is not clear if that residence is located in the same building that the actor lives in.

Smollett did not request paramedics and took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was treated and released. ABC Chicago’s Rob Elgas reports that surveillance video from the apartment building, that Smollett went to after the incident, shows the actor walking “into the building, walks by building security and gets on an elevator. This video is better quality [than the one showing the persons of interest] according to detectives. And what appears to be road salt is on his sweatshirt.”

ABC News reports that the death threats that were sent to the “Empire” set and were addressed to Smollett, are being investigated by the FBI.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood, a police spokesman said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said, noting that the review is ongoing.

Smollett, 36, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

The spokesman said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Milo Ventimiglia named Hasty Pudding Man of the Year

CAMBRIDGE (AP) — Milo Ventimiglia, who stars as Jack Pearson in the award-winning hit television drama “This is Us,” was named 2019 Man of the Year on Wednesday by Harvard University’s Hasty Pudding Theatricals.

Ventimiglia was selected because he has made “significant impressions on television and film,” the oldest theatrical organization in the U.S. said in a statement.

It also didn’t hurt that he played heartthrob Jess Mariano on the television show “Gilmore Girls” from 2001 to 2006.

“We’ve loved his performances in ‘This is Us,’ ‘Heroes,’ and ‘Gilmore Girls,’ but more importantly, he is the childhood crush of our two esteemed producers, Elizabeth (Mann) and Mariana (Sanchez-Medina),” Hasty Pudding President Grace Ramsey said in a statement.

The Emmy-nominated actor will receive his pudding pot at a celebratory roast at Harvard scheduled for Feb. 8.

Bryce Dallas Howard was named Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year on Tuesday.

Maroon 5 won’t take questions before Super Bowl show

Maroon 5 will not take any questions before it takes the stage for the Super Bowl LIII halftime show Sunday.

The NFL announced the band will not hold the event’s annual news conference this year, replacing it with a “cross-platform rollout of behind-the-scenes footage and content from each of our halftime performers.”

Taken at face value, the NFL’s statement indicates the musical acts “will let their show do the talking,” and, sure, maybe the league just doesn’t want to do a news conference that is typically more silly than substantial.

Then again, this year’s Super Bowl halftime show has seen an unusually large amount of politicization from the music world thanks to the league’s treatment of Colin Kaepernick. Rihanna reportedly turned down doing the show in solidarity with Kaepernick, and she wasn’t the only musician to do so. Other famous artists have reportedly lobbied rapper Travis Scott to pull out of the act, with that group including Jay-Z, Common, Nick Cannon and Meek Mill.

Maroon 5 has certainly heard the backlash, which the band’s keyboardist addressed a few weeks ago, saying that the size of the stage made it all worth it."

According to Chicago police, on Tuesday, two unknown assailants accosted the Empire actor on the streets of Chicago, shouted bigoted slurs at him, tied a noose around his neck, and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

""That, I can tell you, is horrible,"" Trump said after a reporter described the assault of Smollett, who is black, gay, and Jewish. ""I've seen it last night. I think that's horrible. It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned."" The president then segued back into discussing U.S. immigration policy.

Smollett's music manager Brandon Z. Moore, who says he was on the phone with him during the attack, told Variety that he heard the attackers shout ""this is MAGA country"" while they were beating the actor, with ""MAGA"" being a reference to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department, confirmed to Variety that Smollett told investigators he heard the assailants shout this phrase.

Smollett himself hasn't publicly spoken about the attack. While discussing the issue Thursday, Trump was not asked specifically about the assailants reportedly using his campaign slogan during the assault.

The CPD has released two images, pulled from surveillance footage, of ""people of interest"" in the attack. However, the pictures are extremely dark and blurry and don't reveal anybody's face, and Guglielmi wrote in a tweet that the surveillance footage in question doesn't capture the assault itself.

ABC News reports that on Jan. 22, the Fox studio that produces Empire received a letter threatening Smollett. The letter contained a powdery substance, which investigators reportedly believe was crushed Tylenol, and according to ABC News, the FBI is now investigating this threat. It's unclear whether the letter is related to the attack on Smollett that unfolded days later.

Terrence Howard, who also stars on Empire, tells ABC News that Fox has offered every actor on the show 24-hour security in light of the letter and attack.

On social media, Smollett received an outpouring of support from fans, politicians, activists and others in the entertainment industry. Danny Strong, Empire's executive producer, wrote that he is ""deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks"" against Smollett, whom he called ""a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart."" Sen. Kamala Harris called the attack an ""attempted modern day lynching,"" and said that Smollett is ""one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know.""

""The horrific attack on Jussie Smollett has no place in a decent human loving society,"" director Rob Reiner tweeted. ""Homophobia existed before Trump, but there is no question that since he has injected his hatred into the American bloodstream, we are less decent,less human,& less loving. No intolerance! No DT!""

Smollett's family released a statement on Thursday, thanking people for their support and drawing attention to the frequency with which hate crimes are committed in America.

""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,"" Smollett's family said in a statement to Fox News.

READ: Chicago Police Identify “Potential Persons Of Interest” In Jussie Smollett Attack

“That I can tell you is horrible,” Trump said when asked about the attack according to Deadline. “It doesn’t get worse.”

The response comes after Chicago police have identified potential persons of interest in regards to Smollett’s assault.

Chicago police released photos late Wednesday, with the pictures showing two silhouettes walking down a street late Tuesday morning according to ABC7 Chicago.

“Obviously the alleged statement of what happened here is horrific and there’s no place for it in the city of Chicago,” Mayor Rahm Emanuel said during a Wednesday evening press briefing.

Following the incident, a neighbor of Smollett’s claimed that she saw a “redneck” loitering near the complex she and Smollett live at before the attack took place. Speaking to TMZ, the unidentified woman said she saw a man pacing back-and-forth between the parking garage and the entrance.

She also described what he was wearing, saying he had on a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up hoodie sweatshirt, too-short blue jeans that exposed his “thick, grey hunting socks,” and camel-colored dress shoes.

The woman also noted that the man had a blue and white rope or clothesline hanging from his sweatshirt. Smollett claimed he was attacked with a noose.

Donald Trump is speaking out about the attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett.

Responding to a question from reporter April Ryan, Trump said, “That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse.”

Smollett was attacked early Tuesday morning by two men who hurled homophobic and racist slurs at him, Chicago Police said. The attackers reportedly called Smollett “that f-ggot Empire n—er” before beating him and tying a noose around his neck. Smollett was able to get away and transport himself to a nearby hospital.

Police have since released photos of the suspects.

The actor’s Empire co-stars have spoken out about the attack, sending their well-wishes to Smollett.

Following the attack, Empire productions sources said security around the actor has been beefed up with Smollett receiving round-the-clock armed security."

CHICAGO — Jussie Smollett's family said Thursday that the attack on the black and gay ""Empire"" actor in downtown Chicago this week was a ""hate crime"" and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn't spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett's family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

The area is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants and has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home, Guglielmi said. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels."

The actor has remained silent since two masked individuals tied a rope around his neck and reportedly threw bleach on his face as they screamed racist and homophobic slurs early Tuesday morning, though sources say he will be back at work when the show returns from its polar vortex hiatus.

""As of now, Jussie plans to return to work when filming for his role picks up again,"" a source told Entertainment Tonight.

They added that production being temporarily shut down because of the Chicago weather allowed Smollett to take some time to process ""everything that happened"" during the attack.

However, the actor and singer will not be slowing down, as he is scheduled to perform at the popular West Hollywood venue, the Troubadour, in Los Angeles on Saturday and has no intention to cancel the gig.

""Jussie is planning to perform a musical show this weekend in L.A. Jussie is strong,"" the source added. ""He knows that what happened to him is unfortunate, but he's not going to let it get the best of him.

They continued: ""He’s a fighter and will push through this, like everything else he has fought through in his life.""

Since reports surfaced that the attack might have been premeditated, Empire production will be supplying the entire cast with armed security as production on the show resumes. The news of the added security came from an emotional meeting between cast and crew on Tuesday following the attack.

FOX also reportedly provided counselors to those involved in production to talk about the hate crime and answer questions.

""The counselors will be there for as long as the cast and crew needs,"" another source told the outlet. ""Everyone processes trauma differently, and the network understands that. The pace of filming will be based on how everyone feels, and the network and people involved want to do whatever they can to make the cast and crew feel safe and supported.""

The investigation into the crime continues, as Chicago P.D. recently released a screenshot of a surveillance video featuring two persons of interest they hope to question in relation to the crime.

""While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,"" Chicago PD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi wrote on Twitter Wednesday."

Unsettling details of what Smollett disclosed about the attack stir up feelings of rage and sorrow within any person possessing a conscience. According to a report released by the Chicago Police Department, Smollett’s assailants yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him before battering him, pouring a chemical substance on him and placing a rope around his neck.

To queer folks, black folks, and black queer folks, the symbolism of the props the perpetrators used — bleach, according to some reports, and a noose, along with the parting shot of “This is MAGA country” — hold a marrow-deep meaning. They are further confirmation that the deadly prejudice falsely believed to a relic of a past never went anywhere. It’s simply been hiding out and waiting for the right moment and signal to resurface.

But the perception of one famous player in this terrible narrative has yet to be discussed, even though Americans have a number of views and opinions about it. I’m referring to Chicago itself.

Right now Chicago is as famous as it is famously misunderstood among major American metropolises. Part of the reason for this perception is due to the city’s portrayal in prime time.

For this reason alone, shows like CBS’s upcoming limited series “The Red Line,” starring Noah Wyle as the spouse of a black gay man gunned down by a cop (Noel Fisher) who mistakes him for an assailant, could give the audiences a more illuminating portrait than anything that’s on television right now.

“The Red Line” debuts April 28, but to view an industry presentation about it in light of the developing story surrounding Smollett’s assault led me to ruminate upon the impact that TV’s portrayal of a place can have on our conversations about it, and the people who coexist and clash within its city limits.

Along with serving as Donald Trump’s go-to example of urban crime and social decay, Chicago is to modern television what New York was to the 1990s and early Aughts: an essential American cultural, socioeconomic and political hub whose legendary architecture, iconic skyline and an expansive waterfront make it impressively telegenic.

Chicago has an extensive backstory known the world over. Never mind the Al Capone of it all -- its political machine is among the nation’s most infamous, established by unscrupulous figures made notorious by the writing of Studs Terkel and Mike Royko and propelled by its colorful aldermen and ward officials.

Corruption is rampant in Chicago’s Police Department, a common knowledge among residents of color and confirmed by a number of studies and sources, including a Justice Department report made public in 2017. Stories involving cops using excessive or lethal force against black or Latinx suspects at a rate disproportionate to white suspects often make national headlines.

For these reasons and others — including the city’s prominence in America’s industrial revolution and the labor movement, and the influx of African Americans who came to the city as part of Great Migration northward in the early part of 20th century — Chicago remains deeply segregated along racial lines. Those divisions are visible on city maps and noticeable when you walk down its sidewalks.

NBC’s “Chicago Fire,” “Chicago P.D.” and “Chicago Med” don’t dwell on that part of the story, because they’re series about people working within a specific structure. In those narratives the city’s identity is all but incidental.

And while I can’t say that “The Red Line” stands to definitely fill in those blanks, it is at least an intentionally noble effort. This is evidenced in the title: “The Red Line” is named for the elevated train line that runs from the northernmost part of the city, where a quick transfer takes commuters from wealthy suburbs such as Evanston (home to Northwestern University) into the downtown core, and to the deep South Side, where the majority of the city’s African American population lives.

Advertisement:

The train line, as showrunner Caitlin Parrish told journalists attending a Wednesday morning press conference for the series, “[traverses] pretty much every neighborhood and demographic. And so as segregated as Chicago is, there is this means of transportation that touches on every kind of person in the city.”

(Producers and stars of “The Red Line” appeared as part of CBS’s presentation at Television Critics Association’s Winter Press Tour currently underway in Pasadena, CA.)

Parrish went on to explain when she and co-creator Erica Weiss first envisioned the drama, “we knew that we were going to be telling a story about very specific differences but also the things that connect us and the things that bring us together, and it just was our metaphor of choice.”

That said, “The Red Line” isn’t entirely a corrective enterprise. The miniseries began its existence as a theatrical work, and its most impactful aspects are emotional touchstones entirely linked to character. Chicago isn’t anonymous, but it is a stage where the flaws of its individuals are laid bare. But Chicago’s flaws, suffered and exploited by its residents, even fictional ones, are symptoms of an established political and social framework. At least in its opening episodes, that isn’t explicitly confronted.

“Our goal with ‘The Red Line’ was to have an important cultural conversation through the lens of an emotional family drama,” Weiss said. “We wanted to create “The Red Line” so that there would be a show that many different Americans from all different backgrounds could watch, maybe who wouldn’t otherwise watch the same show, and see themselves and therefore perhaps see each other more clearly.”

Most TV series adopt a character-focused approach for the same reason. The success of a show rests entirely on how much the audience relates to the fictional people within it and not necessarily the places they populate.

Just as the New York City of “Friends” or “Seinfeld” existed primarily in the minds of its writers, in Showtime’s “Shameless,” Chicago is a stomping ground for the Gallaghers, a working class family that feels authentically Chicagoan but really could live just about anywhere.

In the CBS All Access drama “The Good Fight,” Chicago is a liberal bastion, as co-creator Robert King told critics.

“We just thought it was a good city to place an African American firm,” he told critics on Wednesday. He’s not alone in that perception. “Proven Innocent,” Fox’s upcoming legal drama about a team of lawyers working to exonerate the wrongfully convicted, is set in Chicago but could just as easily exist in any major Northern American city.

Kelsey Grammer, one of the series co-stars and its primary antagonist, has a history with the place, having formerly starred as its id-driven amoral mayor in the short-lived Starz series “Boss.” Through that series, as well as Netflix’s “Easy,” Chicago is portrayed as a desirable place to and for people of means. FX’s “The League” also is set in Chicago, but for the most part the only people of color its principal cast members interacted with during the series were professional athletes.

And when USA Network decided to spin off Gina Torres’ “Suits” character Jessica Pearson, the producers moved her home to the Windy City, where she is now a political insider working with the city’s mayor. Chicago’s city hall is, apparently, one of the sexiest places to be.

Truly modern Chicago is a many faceted product of a colorful history, like any American city. And just like every city, violent crime is part of that story. But the average viewer's understanding about it, and any large American city for that matter, is the notion that once a person attains a certain economic stature and level of fame, this somehow enables that person to transcend the weight of race and class imposed by the residents of that city, and wider culture in general.

This is doubly true for someone like Smollett, a man starring in popular TV series airing on a major broadcast network. Black gay men are assaulted by strangers in cities around the country every day, and the world keeps on stepping. The fact that this black, gay man is a public figure, and the fact that the assault reportedly took place in one of Chicago’s wealthier neighborhoods, adds elements that make the crime even more shocking.

If this were a common mugging it would fit the Trump Administration narrative of Chicago being a lawless hellscape. If the suspects were brown or black, this would bring to life the conservative specter of cities being destroyed by black-on-black crime. Instead, the persons of interest sought by the police presented as members of the MAGA faithful, confidently spewing racist invective, according to Smollett’s report.

But the jaw-dropping part, to those who know how different living in American cities (and this country in general) can be for a white person and everyone else, is the disbelief coming from some quarters that a racist, homophobic hate crime could happen in the supposed liberal bastion that is Chicago, on a street, in full view of possible witnesses.

It’s only unbelievable if you don’t know the dynamics of every major city and, honestly, America’s past, present and likely future.

The Chicago element of the Smollett case, however, brings to light to the vast distance between the image established via political bluster and TV fiction, and the truth of this place.

But it also reveals the opportunity TV, particularly broadcast series, have to portray the truth of any established, famous locale. And Chicago is in many ways a model setting for sparking conversations about the racial, economic and social fault lines threatening to shake our democracy apart.

All credit is due to “The Chi,” Lena Waithe’s Showtime series that depicts the city from the perspective of its African American residents, whose life circumstances are similarly difficult to that of the Gallaghers but set in a side of town tourists are aware of but most never visit.

However, Showtime has a limited audience with the means to afford a premium cable subscription. Millions more viewers watch Dick Wolf’s Chicago titles and will potentially view “The Red Line.” “Pearson” has a cable berth, as does the upcoming Comedy Central series “South Side,” set in a rent-to-own store in Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood. Both are basic cable series, granting them a wider exposure than any view on basic cable.

And each promises a view of the city in its variety and its humanity — whether via the comfortable polished stone architecture of its power centers, as seen in “Pearson,” or from the perspective of an aspirational working class entrepreneur.

At this point it’s too early to tell whether any of the city’s newest portrayals, or all of them in summary, will provide a more clarifying view of what Chicago actually is. And in some respect, that makes sense; how much do we really know about our stars?

A place, and its fame, lives beyond the whims and appeal of an entertainment season. The hope is that stories about it contained within that span can tell us few truths about it, and about us, that transcend any single incident, uplifting or terrible.

Chicago can be a fictional character, but outside of primetime, beyond television, it’s a real place whose people endure problems both minor and existential. Where life can be wonderful for all, but tends to be unfair and dangerous for specific people and for very specific, systemic reasons.

Typically we’re reminded of that when something awful happens to someone the widest swath of people can relate to. But since we have multiple fictionalized opportunities to see city stories on the TV schedule, it would be useful to witness these truths more frequently."

The Chicago Police Department (CPD) said “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett and his music manager are not handing over phone records of a conversation that occurred Tuesday morning during an alleged attack.

“Update on the ‘Empire’ Smollett case: The victim and his manager reported that they were talking on their cell phones to each other but CPD has been unable to independently verify this because they refused to turn over their cell phones,” CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a Thursday statement obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Smollett claimed two men beat him up, tied a noose around his neck, said racial and homophobic slurs and threw an unknown chemical substance on him Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.

Brandon Z. Moore, Smollett’s music manager, said he heard some of the attack while on the phone with Smollett, according to Variety.

“I heard that clearly,” Moore said. “I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur.”

TMZ reported Tuesday the attackers were white men wearing ski masks who poured bleach on Smollett and screamed “This is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country.” Smollett reportedly had a fractured rib as well.

Police said the actor did not initially disclose the “MAGA country” comment, but confirmed it in a second interview.

Guglielmi added Moore claimed in the follow-up interview that he heard the “MAGA country” phrase, ABC7 reported.

A police statement said the incident occurred around 2 a.m. on Tuesday.

Police were notified 40 minutes after the attack and found Smollett in his apartment with cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around the actor’s neck, according to AP. Smollett asked police to shut down the body cameras as he explained why the rope was around his neck.

Smollett was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and was in “good condition,” according to People Tuesday.

Guglielmi said Tuesday evening they could not find video evidence of Smollett getting attacked. Police expanded their search area and found “people of interest” Wednesday, according to a tweet by Guglielmi.

The picture shows two people walking between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. in the vicinity where Smollett was allegedly attacked Tuesday, ABC7 reported. Police confirmed Smollett walking across the street from the two people. Cops also found on another camera that looked like Smollett was “wearing a rope like a neck tie.”

Investigation is ongoing.

On Tuesday the 26-year old anti-LGBT, racist vlogger took to Twitter to share her “Final Thoughts” on illegal immigration.

Lahren never takes a position without making it a personal attack on her perceived enemies. Every tweet, every appearance is a two-fisted fight with the goal of taking down both the left and what she sees as their policies – even if she’s 100% wrong. As long as she belittles Democrats, liberals, progressives, and occasionally Republicans, she apparently considers it a win.

Take today’s attack.

“To all you RINOs who insist this illegal immigration bum-rush isn’t about votes, BS,” says Lahren, slamming some unknown, unnamed group of Republicans.

“Democrats have clear goals: make illegal entry as easy as possible, eliminate electoral college, allow illegals to vote, win every election for the foreseeable future.”

Now, let’s be really honest here.

Yes, of course Democrats want to “win every election for the foreseeable future.” Because, who doesn’t? So it’s just a ridiculous statement on its face.

And yes, many Democrats (and some Republicans) do believe the Electoral College is no longer useful in our electoral system. Consider that George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore in 2000, yet he became president. Similarly, Donald Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, yet he became president.

It’s only happened four times in history, and two of those times in the past two decades. Something’s wrong.

But claiming Democrats want to “make illegal entry as easy as possible,” and “allow illegals to vote” are just lies. Pure and simple.

And really dumb lies, as many on social media swarmed together to let her know.

Take a look at some of the responses:

(William Thomas Cain/Getty)

The Christian owner of a print shop has defended his decision to reject a LGBT charity fund’s brochure, claiming it’s against his religion to “promote” the gay lifestyle.

Yorke Printe Shoppe in Lombard, Illinois had received the order for brochures on behalf of LGBT Community Fund, a local Chicago charity fund that has raised more than $1 million for LGBT+ causes.

The print shop’s owner Brad Scull had initially accepted the order and scheduled the job—but cancelled it after realising the charity would benefit LGBT+ causes.

Print shop owner attacks ‘promotion of the lifestyle’

Speaking to local business newspaper Crain’s Chicago Business on January 28, Scull said: “I’m a Christian, I believe in Scripture, and my faith is really important to me.

Scull insisted he has “nothing against” gay people, because he has gay friends and business associates.

But he added: “I have an issue when stuff gets into the promotion of the lifestyle.

“I don’t think people really understand that I can love the people and maybe not agree with them… but people don’t do the same for me.”

The brochure was commissioned on behalf of the Community Fund by Deborah Schneider of marketing firm Kineo Group.

LGBT charity workers were shocked by discrimination

Schneider explained to Crain’s that she works with many nonprofits, and had used Scull’s printing service for around 20 years.

She added that her company would be getting all its printing elsewhere for now on, adding: “He made a decision as a businessman, and I made a decision as a businesswoman.”

The LGBT Community Fund has threatened to file a civil rights complaint over the incident.

Co-chair Adnaan Hamid said of the discrimination: “You think in this day and age it doesn’t happen, but it does.”

The Illinois Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Tensions are heightened for Chicago’s LGBT+ community in the wake of an attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

Police have released CCTV stills of two persons they are seeking to identify in connection with the attack on Smollett, which took place on January 29.

Smollett, who plays a high-profile gay character on Fox show Empire, was hospitalised after the violent incident, in which he was reportedly branded a “faggot Empire n****r” and had a noose tied around his neck by two men.

ThatGrapeJuice, the first outlet to report the attack, alleged that a threatening letter was sent to Smollett days before the attack that reads: “You will die black fag.”

The envelope featured the acronym ‘MAGA,’ which stands for the pro-Trump slogan “Make America Great Again.”"

""That, I can tell you, is horrible. I've seen it. Last night. I think that's horrible. It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned,"" he told reporters Thursday.

Trump's voice is the latest in a slew of government officials and celebrities speaking out against the alleged racist and homophobic attack against Smollett. As previously reported, the 35-year-old actor told police early Tuesday morning that two men tied a rope around his neck, threw bleach on his face and yelled homophobic and racial slurs at him.

Police released photos of two potential suspects, showing two men wearing dark clothing. They were allegedly seen walking near the location of the incident between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. Police are calling them people of interest as they try to decipher if they were witnesses to the alleged crime or if they were involved.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that the men were ""in the area of the alleged assault & battery.""

""While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,"" he added.

Gugielmi told PEOPLE that Smollett ""goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men. They were masked and wearing black clothing. They called him an Empire... and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.""

Smollett then returned to his apartment and called his manager, who arrived and determined that they should call the police. In a second interview with police, Smollett recalled the attackers referring to ""MAGA"" during the altercation.

Smollett has yet to comment on the attack, which left him with lacerations to his face and neck. He was released from a hospital shortly after the attack and is said to be ""physically O.K."" The attack came eight days after FOX Studios had received an anonymous letter threatening the actor's life. The letter, featuring words spelled with cut-out letter, reportedly read ""You will die black f—.""

Empire has reportedly upped security as the cast continues production in Chicago.

His Empire co-star, Taraji P. Henson, who plays his on-screen mother, spoke out against the incident on Wednesday.

“I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now,"" Henson wrote, sharing a black-and-white video of Smollett performing his song “F.U.W.” ""[Jussie Smollett] is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.""

""This song needs to be downloaded until it goes triple platinum because the message is NEEDED,"" she continued of Smollett's political track. ""#weareresilientpeople AND #weaintgoingnowhereuntillwearefinished. The love so many have him just goes to show HE IS LOVE!!!! I LOVE YOU MY BABY MY BABY!!! #LOVEWINSALWAYS.""

Smollet's on-screen father, Terrence Howard, also spoke about the attack during an appearance on Good Morning America on Wednesday.

“I heard he’s getting better,"" Howard said of Smollett. ""He’s angry, but I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate, and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

“Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood,” he continued. “He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family — you know, the FOX family, the Empire family, the Lyon family — were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.”"

The duo also reportedly put a rope around Smollett's neck -- believed to mimic a noose -- before fleeing the scene. Chicago police confirmed that the ""Empire"" star can be seen entering his apartment after the attack with a rope around his neck. The confirmation came hours after authorities released a screen grab of the suspected attackers that they obtained from nearby surveillance footage.

While attacking the openly gay actor, the criminals also reportedly screamed ""this is MAGA country,"" referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

Though Smollett has yet to speak out about the assault, his publicist told the AP that he ""is at home and recovering."" He is still expected to perform as a previously-booked gig in West Hollywood this weekend. Though ""Empire"" was initially continuing production, dangerously cold temperatures in the city have forced the show to halt production for the time being.

Fellow celebrities and public figures have continued to speak out about the violent attack on social media.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

CHICAGO — ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has refused to turn over his cellphone to detectives, who are investigating the alleged attack that sent him to the hospital earlier this week, Chicago police said Thursday.

The actor declined to share telephone records that could show he was speaking with his manager just as the alleged assault happened early Tuesday morning in Chicago, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told NBC News.

Smollett has told police he was confronted by two men who allegedly hurled racist and homophobic slurs just before they beat him up. They are investigating the case as a possible hate crime.

The manager has told police he heard the attackers say, ""This is MAGA country,"" during the assault, officials said.

When police asked Smollett for his cellphone and records to confirm the call, he refused to share them, according to Guglielmi.

It wasn't immediately clear if Chicago police would seek to obtain those records independently.

A representative for the actor did not immediately return messages seeking comment about the cellphone and phone records.

But in a prepared statement issued late Thursday afternoon, Smollett's family, through the same representative, reiterated his claim of being attacked because of his race and orientation.

""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" according to the family statement.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""

Police have reviewed hundreds of hours of footage from more than 20 surveillance cameras in the area, according to Guglielmi. They have not found any images of the alleged attack, but do have footage that shows part of Smollet's journey to and from the neighborhood.

Police have released pictures, taken from surveillance cameras, of two ""potential people of interest"" but stopped short of calling them suspects.

The head of state is the latest celebrity to weigh-in on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett‘s publicized Chicago attack.

During a press conference, President Trump called the assault nothing less than horrible.

On Thursday, the President of the United States was asked about the homophobic, racist attack against Smollett by a reporter in the Oval Office. “That, I can tell you, is horrible,” Trump said. “I’ve seen it, last night. I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned.” (E! News)

Coincidentally, Smollett’s attack came from alleged Make America Great Again supporters.

4:00 PM PT — Chicago PD confirms to TMZ Jussie told them, in a follow-up interview, about the attackers yelling, “MAGA country.” They add Jussie still had the rope around his neck when he made contact with cops at 2:42 AM. Remember, the attack happened around 2 AM. (TMZ)

This week, comedian Mike Epps invited Jussie’s attackers to run up on him next month.

Earlier in the week, reports revealed Jussie might have turned down having security days after Fox Studios received a threatening letter aimed at him.

We’re told Fox made the call to beef up security for everyone on set and wanted to give Jussie additional protection around the clock … but, he declined. Our sources say he made the decision to not have extra security during off-hours because it was an intrusive way of living. Our “Empire” production sources tell us Jussie will have 24/7 armed security going forward … at least until the 2 thugs are apprehended. (TMZ)

According to reports, the horrific attack went down Tuesday.

The Empire star, 36, was approached by two people who began “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him,” according to Guglielmi. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.” The attackers fled the scene before Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He has since been released. Guglielmi tells Us that the actor is in “good condition,” and detectives are investigating the incident. (Us Weekly)

President Donald Trump on Thursday called the attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett “horrible,” condemning the assault by individuals who the actor alleged referenced the president’s campaign slogan as they attacked him.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was attacked in Chicago just after 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, the Chicago Tribune reported , by two people who also poured an unknown chemical substance on the actor and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene. The two assailants also allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs during the attack.

Police are investigating the episode as a potential hate crime.

“It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned,” Trump said of the attack during an Oval Office exchange with the White House press pool on Thursday.

Smollett told detectives that as the attackers wrapped the rope around his neck — which a friend of the actor described as a noose — they yelled, “This is MAGA country,” the Tribune reported . Trump did not comment on the alleged reference to his campaign slogan.

The 36-year-old actor was hospitalized and later released. In the days since, celebrities and politicians across the country have joined the chorus of condemnation and offered words of support to Smollett, an activist who has spoken out against Trump in the past. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.) sent a letter to FBI director Chris Wray calling for an immediate investigation of the attack.

Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted on Tuesday night: “What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.”

Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed : “The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.”

All charges against Jussie Smollett, one of the stars of Fox’s Empire, were dropped on Tuesday by Cook County prosecutors, according to a statement from his attorneys. Smollett had been arrested on February 21 on charges of allegedly filing a false police report about an attack he reported on January 29. Smollett had contacted police to say that early that January morning in Chicago, he was the subject of racist and homophobic slurs and violence from masked perpetrators. Police eventually said that they believed that had Smollett paid two brothers, Abimbola Osundairo and Olabinjo Osundairo, to stage the attack. Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, the singing and piano-playing son of Terrence Howard’s character on the show about a family of hip-hop moguls; Smollett identifies as gay, as does the character.

“Today, all criminal charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped and his record has been wiped clean of the filing of this tragic complaint,” the statement said. The attorneys said that the episode was a “reminder that there should never be an attempt to try a case in the report of public opinion.” They said that Smollett “was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator.”

That’s all we know for now about the latest development. Below, how the controversy unfolded:

What did Jussie Smollett report?

Smollett was in the Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago in the early hours of Tuesday, January 29, when he said he was attacked by two people who were yelling racial and homophobic slurs, and who Smollett said shouted the phrase “MAGA country.” At some point, he said they also poured an unknown substance on him, believed to be bleach, and forced a rope around his neck. Both perpetrators were said to have fled the scene, and Smollett went to an apartment building from where the police were called. He was able to eventually transport himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Smollett was reportedly on the phone with his manager when the attack occurred, which phone records later verified. “I heard that clearly,” his manager told Variety. “I heard the scuffle, and I heard the racial slur.”

What did police investigate?

Chicago police combed through hours of surveillance footage from the area and were joined by the FBI, because the nature of the alleged attack on Smollett meant that it was likely a hate crime. A threatening letter similarly targeting Smollett was reportedly sent to Fox in Chicago before the attack. They found footage of Smollett entering the apartment building with a rope around his neck, per police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. “It was being worn like a necktie but shaped like a noose,” Guglielmi said.

Who were the alleged attackers?

Police first released footage of two “potential persons of interest” who were seen in the area. They said they had surveillance of Smollett at the scene of the crime; per ABC News, “In the video, he walks out of frame for about a minute and reappears on another camera,” with the rope around his neck and what appears to be road salt on his sweatshirt.

Around this time, sources began informing media that Smollett was not cooperating fully with police, including giving phone records that were heavily redacted. (Smollett said they were redacted for privacy reasons.) Police then used taxi and rideshare information to identify the Osundairo brothers, who were both associated with Smollett and Empire, and who had flown to Nigeria directly after the alleged incident. The brothers were arrested on February 13 at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport but were released without charges, and released the following statement: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.” CBS Chicago reported that they told police Smollett had paid them to stage the attack.

What did police charge Smollett with?

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said in a police briefing on February 21 that Smollett paid the two men $3,500 to stage the attack, taking “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.” Police also said they had new information on where materials such as the rope used to make the noose found on Smollett’s neck, masks, and gloves had been purchased, including surveillance footage. Johnson also said that Smollett had sent the threatening letter to himself at the Fox studio where Empire is filmed. “Bogus police reports cause real harm,” Johnson told reporters. “I am offended by what’s happened, and I’m also angry.” He also said that, “As far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on [Smollett’s] face were most likely self-inflicted,” and that Smollett spoke to the brothers via phone, records show, before and after the attack.

Johnson said Smollett “attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic, and political language. When that didn’t work, Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago’s reputation through the mud in the process. And why? The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary. So he concocted a story about being attacked.” Previously, reports had speculated that Smollett was going have his workload reduced or be written off of Empire, which representatives denied.

Smollett was arrested at around 5:00 a.m. CT on February 21, facing a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false report. Smollett’s charge, a Class 4 felony, carried a possible sentence of one to three years in prison and fines.

What has Smollett said publicly?

Initially a spokesman for Smollett said that “he is out of the hospital and home recovering.” Smollett told CNN’s Don Lemon on January 29 that he fought back and was shaken and angry."

Chicago police have released low-resolution images showing two people they’re seeking to identify and interview in connection with Tuesday’s incident. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, police said they were walking on New Street near Illinois Street between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m, around the time and about a block away from where Smollett claimed he was attacked.

“While the video footage does not depict an assault, the individuals pictured are seen in the vicinity of the alleged criminal incident during the alleged time of occurrence,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. “Detectives are taking this investigation seriously and urging anyone with any information on the identity of these individuals to contact Area Central detectives.”

According to TMZ, Smollett was exiting a Chicago Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. Tuesday when one of two men in ski masks asked him, “Aren’t you that f****t ‘Empire’ n****r?” before they both attacked the openly gay, black actor. Reports indicated that the men also tied a noose around his neck and dumped a liquid, possibly bleach, on him before fleeing the scene.

The attack reportedly came days after a threatening letter was sent to Fox Studios in Chicago and was specifically addressed to Smollett. The alleged letter in question, obtained by ThatGrapeJuice.net, reads, “You will die black f*g,” in cut-and-paste magazine clippings. The letter apparently also appears to show a red stick figure being shot with a gun. ABC News reported that the envelope contained a powdery substance that was likely Tylenol.

As of Thursday afternoon, police haven’t released surveillance footage of the reported attack or the events leading up to it. According to the Chicago Tribune, Guglielmi said they’re still reviewing footage, which they hope they can use to “follow” the possible persons of interest’s paths.

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett's apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven't found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor ""is at home and recovering.""

Meanwhile, police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose images police released to the public late Wednesday. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have information that could be useful to the investigation.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

The Commander-in-Chief was questioned about the attack on actor and singer Jussie Smollett in Chicago and echoed the sentiment of many across America referring to the attack as “horrible.”

Smollett was the target of a hate crime earlier this week, which reportedly left him beaten while a noose was hung around his neck. A chemical was also tossed on to him. The attackers were believed to catch Smollett’s attention by yelling racial and homophobic statements and eventually “MAGA country” during the attack.

President Trump spoke with the press Thursday morning and was questioned on the incident. While he was not able to offer any solutions, he did acknowledge that it was a disgusting act.

“That I can tell you is horrible. I’ve seen it, last night,” Trump said. “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

Since the incident occurred there has been an outpour of support for Smollett across the nation and the Internet. The Chicago Police have yet to apprehend the offenders but did release an image of two persons of interest who were present in the area near the time of the attack.

That was the extent of his response. Trump then immediately switched to the topic of a wall-less Mexican border, which he called ""the worst sin of all"" in a long rant about immigration.

Republican leaders have been largely silent about Smollett, who was stopped around 2 a.m. Tuesday in downtown Chicago by two men wearing ski masks and yelling racial and homophobic slurs. The individuals then placed a noose around Smollett’s neck. The two men punched Smollett and then poured an unknown substance on him.

""This is MAGA country,"" the men then yelled, according to Chicago police officials who spoke to The Advocate — MAGA, of course, being a reference to Trump's campaign slogan of ""Make America Great Again."" This information was gleaned from interviews with Smollett after the attack, according to the Chicago Police Department.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, released a statement Wednesday on Twitter condemning ""the racist, homophobic attack"" as ""an affront to our humanity.""

The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all. — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) January 30, 2019

No arrests have been made yet in Smollett's attack, which police are investigating as a possible hate crime. The first images of possible attackers were released Wednesday, although authorities are still reviewing footage from security cameras.

“While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,"" CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi stated as the photos were released."

CHICAGO -- Jussie Smollett's family said Thursday that the attack on the black and gay ""Empire"" actor in downtown Chicago this week was a ""hate crime"" and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn't spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett's family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

They thanked the public ""for their prayers"" and said the family is ""so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.""

""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,"" the family said. ""Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.""

They said such incidents will continue to happen until people are held accountable.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" is shot in Chicago and follows an African-American family navigating the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Smollett has told police that he was walking home from a Subway restaurant when the attack occurred. Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of his walk home, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's manager called police about 40 minutes after Smollett got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels. Smollett was walking in an area that has high-end hotels and restaurants. It also has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home, Guglielmi said.

It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned."

“Confirmed with two Chicago PD sources that Jussie Smollett and his manager refused to show Smollett’s manager was on the phone with Jussie when the attack took place,” tweeted reporter Yashar Ali Thursday morning, adding it was “not clear if Chicago PD will move to obtain records independently.”

This development comes on the heels of a series of questions regarding the attack on the actor on the streets of Chicago early Tuesday morning. Smollett reportedly told police his attackers were two white men who yelled, “This is MAGA country,” wrapped a noose around his neck, poured an “unknown chemical substance on him,” and called him racial and homophobic slurs. It was reported Thursday that police had surveillance footage of Smollett returning to his apartment with a rope tied around his neck.

3:30 p.m.

The family of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett says that they have no doubt that the actor is a victim of a “racial and homophobic hate crime.”

In a statement released via one of Smollett’s representatives, the family seems to dispute any suggestion that Smollett wasn’t truthful with police when he reported that two men in masks beat him early Tuesday, hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, threw an undetermined chemical on him and looped a rope around his neck. The family says Smollett has told police “everything” and that his account of what happened has “never changed.”

Such doubts have been expressed online as police have reported that they have not yet located any surveillance video of the attack and that Smollett declined to turn over phone records that would show he was talking to his agent on the phone at the time of the attack, as he told detectives. Police have said that Smollett has been cooperative.

A Chicago police spokesman says surveillance video shows that “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett had a rope around his neck as he walked into his apartment building the night he reported he was attacked by two masked men.

Anthony Guglielmi (goo-lee-EHL’-mee) said Thursday that police still haven’t recovered any surveillance video of the early Tuesday attack, but that the building’s security footage shows Smollett arrived home wearing the rope minutes after he says it occurred.

Smollett, who is gay and black, says two men beat him, hurled racial and homophobic insults at him, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and looped the rope around his neck before fleeing.

Police want to talk to two people seen on surveillance video walking in that section of downtown Chicago at the time of the attack. They have released their images to the media in the hopes that someone will recognize them or they themselves will come forward.

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett's apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

The Empire actor, of course, was brutally beaten in Chicago very early on Tuesday morning, with the two assailants taunting Smollett for being gay and African-American and also screaming that he's in ""MAGA country.""

It's a truly awful and depressing story.

In the wake of this tragedy, an endless array of stars around Hollywood have sent their thoughts and prayers and best wishes to Smollett.

And Khloe is now here to do the same.

“My heart breaks for @JussieSmollett!” the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star wrote to open her statement on her Instagram Story.

She continued:

“I am horrified by what happened to this beautiful soul! No one EVER deserves what has taken place! We are in a shameful place in American history where blatant racism and bigotry is escalating at a scary rate.

""We must stand up and demand what is right.”

Smollett wasn't merely assaulted.

He had a rope wrapped around his neck and he had bleach poured all over him.

As many have noted online, this was a modern-day lynching. Truly sickening.

Concluded Kardashian in her post:

I am so beyond sorry!! So much evil out there! I am praying for your soul to be at peace, your heart to heal and for these horrible excuses of people to be caught and prosecuted!

I am disgusted.

We feel the same way.

Smollett reportedly stumbled into his apartment building lobby after the attack and called his manager.

The manager then called the police and took Smollett to the hospital.

Late yesterday, meanwhile, authorities in Chicago confirmed that two suspects have been caught on surveillance cameras.

We don't know their names and it's nearly impossible to see their faces and/or make out very many details -- but police have released the following images to the public in order to see if anyone can be of assistance.

""Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,” Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday night, adding:

""While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.""

Smollett also received a death threat via mail just over a week prior to this attack.

The FBI is investigating that incident and detectives are now working hard to identify the men in these snapshots.

Elsewhere, police have confirmed to TMZ that they have video of Smollett with rope draped around his neck as he walks through the lobby of his building.

That footage was captured by a building surveillance camera.

Guglielmi previously confirmed that reports on the Internet over what transpired are accurate.

""The victim [went] to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men,"" the official report read after news of the assault went viral.

""They were masked and wearing black clothing... and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word.

""They proceeded to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.""

We continue to keep Smollett in our thoughts and we'll continue to update our site with news as it breaks."

The Chicago police are investigating the violent attack as a possible hate crime, and are canvassing for surveillance video footage of the attack and of the alleged attackers. While the case is garnering a high profile due to his fame and the brutal nature of the attack, it’s not an isolated event: Statistics about violence against LGBTQ people of color show why it's so important to be vocal about supporting vulnerable groups.

According to the FBI, reported hate crimes rose 17 percent from 2016 to 2017, the most recent year for which statistics are available, with 58.1 percent of the attacks motivated by hatred toward the victim’s race, ancestry, or ethnicity. Another 15.9 percent were motivated by hatred toward the victim’s sexuality. It's important to note that these statistics are recorded as ""single-bias incidents,"" meaning the attacks were motivated by only one bias; the FBI noted there were 335 victims ""multiple-bias incidents,"" or 3 percent of 8,828 total victims during this same time period, but does not distinguish which biases were involved in those incidents. A ""multiple-bias incident"" is one where the incident is ""motivated by two or more biases,"" according to the FBI, or where multiple facets of a victim's identity are under threat.

Statistics specifically around violence against LGBTQ folks find higher incidences of violence against people of color who also identify as LGBTQ. According to statistics from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), 87 percent of LGBTQ and HIV-affected people murdered in 2011 were people of color, which GLAAD notes was a 70 percent increase over the year before; in 2016, an updated report from the NCAVP about survivors of hate violence found that 61 percent of survivors identified as a person of color. These statistics are from the same year, the report notes, as the shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people and injured 53 — the majority of whom were LGBTQ and Latinx.

The rise in reported hate crimes comes with one really big point of clarification. More law enforcement agencies reported hate crimes to the FBI in 2017 than ever before — 1,000 more agencies than in 2016, to be exact. That increase in reporting may account for at least some of the percentage increase.

Reporting hate crime statistics to the FBI is voluntary and many hate crimes go unreported, according to The New York Times. Both Miami and Las Vegas reported zero hate crimes in 2017, according to the Times. When the Times reached out to those jurisdictions, a spokeswoman from Las Vegas told the Times that “the report was made in error” and there were actually 61 hate crimes in that city in 2017.

The available numbers on hate crimes aren’t necessarily 100 percent accurate, but it’s hard to deny that the general atmosphere of racism and hate has been on the rise since the 2016 presidential election, as the NAACP said in a June 2018 statement. “From campaign to election, this president has spewed the language of division and hate and it has manifested in not only racist policies but in racists acts against people of color and other groups,” NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said in the statement.

However, there are advocacy groups that are working to protect queer people of color in this environment. One notable group is the National Black Justice Coalition (NBJC), which works to empower Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and same gender loving (LGBTQ/SGL) people. The NBJC released a statement about the alleged attack almost immediately.

""We are deeply saddened, disheartened and devastated that an attack steeped in racist and homophobic hatred could happen to anyone,” the NBJC wrote in a statement emailed to Bustle. “But we are not surprised. This attack is a sad reminder that none of us — not even our famous entertainers — are safe from the ugly visages of white supremacy, anti-Blackness and homophobia.”

The NBJC also specifically mentioned the hardships faced by Black trans women, a group that faces a vastly disproportionate amount of violence. If you’re upset by the attack on Smollett — and the increasing number of attacks on queer people, queer people of color, and people of color in general, you can support organizations that are pushing back against hate.

Some organizations doing work to support these groups are:

Donating or volunteering your time to any of these groups directly supports vulnerable populations at risk of this kind of violence.

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett's apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven't found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor was at home and recovering. Smollett's family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying the actor was the victim of a ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and pushing back against any suggestion that he was anything but truthful with the police.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

When a reporter asked Trump about the attack on Smollett, which police in Chicago are investigating as a hate crime, the president said he had seen reports about the incident and called them “horrible” before launching into a rant about undocumented immigration.

“What I think is the worst sin of all is the fact that we’re allowing people to come into this country and sell drugs and human traffic and do all of these horrible things, that if we had the simplicity of a well constructed, beautiful barrier or wall, they wouldn’t be able to come into our country,” Trump said. “That to me is the great sin.

(Phil McCarten/Reuters)

Three days after the alleged attack, it’s not clear what actually happened. Here’s hoping we find out more.

The case of the openly gay television actor who has alleged that he was beaten up by racist homophobic Trump fans late Monday/early Tuesday at 2 a.m. grows more curious by the hour. Three days later, it’s not clear that an attack took place. And Jussie Smollett’s behavior has been odd.

On Tuesday, in response to a Joe Biden tweet expressing outrage over the alleged hate-crime assault on Smollett, longtime Chicago TV reporter Rafer Weigel of Fox 32 wrote: “Might be best to tone down the outrage on the #JussieSmollett story until more evidence comes in to suggest it actually happened.” Later the reporter added: “To be clear. I am not accusing [Smollett] of lying. I’m saying #ChicagoPD and Chicago FBI have been working round the clock & have found nothing to support it. And given the extremity of his claims and where they allegedly took place it has them skeptical.”

On Wednesday, police revealed that they have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video recorded around the area (near 300 E. North Lower Water Street) where Smollett says the attack took place. Police called it a “very high density” area for surveillance cameras, but they still have found no evidence that any assault took place. There are no witnesses and nothing like the assault described appears on any of the videos. What they have released are low-quality images of two “persons of interest” who crossed paths with Smollett and could have been witnesses or bystanders or even perpetrators.

TMZ led the way on the story Tuesday with claims that “sources directly connected to” the actor said that as Smollett was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop, someone yelled, “Aren’t you that faggot Empire n*****?’”

TMZ’s sources added that the two attackers were both white and wearing ski masks. They allegedly beat him so badly they broke one of his ribs, and also put a rope around his neck, yelled racist and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him, “and as they left they yelled, ‘This is MAGA country.’” A crudely lettered note sent to Fox’s Chicago studios last week made a death threat and an anti-gay slur against Smollett, but the actor turned down Fox’s offer to provide him with a round-the-clock security detail, according to TMZ.

Smollett did not initially mention the MAGA detail to police, according to a department spokesman. He waited until a subsequent interview with police later in the day on Tuesday to inform them of this. In addition, police said that Smollett couldn’t identify the race of his attackers because their faces were concealed and didn’t know what liquid was poured on him.

There is one possible piece of corroboration for Smollett’s story: He and his manager both say the two were talking on Smollett’s phone when the attack happened. The manager says he heard at least some of the attack, including the MAGA remark and the slurs. Police would like to examine Smollett’s phone to find out more. But they say he won’t give it to them.

There is of course ample evidence of animosity between the actor and Donald Trump’s side, but so far all of the expressions of hatred are coming from Smollett. This is the kind of remark Smollett makes about the president on Twitter:

Shut the hell up you bitch ass nigga. You will continue to run this country further into the ground and risk lives every time you breathe. You’re not the president. Just a dumpster full of hate. FOH. Sick to my stomach that literal shit currently represents America to the world. https://t.co/qoNWllmZIm — Jussie Smollett (@JussieSmollett) January 12, 2018

Surveillance video shows Smollett walking into an apartment building and past security guards without stopping to ask them for help or to tell them he had just been subjected to a vicious assault and hate crime. In this video, he was wearing a rope around his neck “like a necktie but shaped like a noose,” according to a police spokesman. At some point the police were contacted and Smollett was interviewed in a friend’s apartment at 2:42 a.m. He asked police to turn off their body cameras so the encounter would not be recorded. At this point, he was still wearing the rope around his neck, police said.

So let’s recap what Smollett says happened, together with what Chicago reporters have heard from police. Two men recognized a gay black actor from a TV show at 2 a.m. on a Chicago street during an extreme cold snap while he was on his phone. Instead of taking the phone from him, they began to shout slurs at him. The assailants happened to have a rope and an unknown liquid with them. They put a rope around his neck, but instead of strangling him with it, they just left it there and then ran away. Instead of calling the police immediately on the phone, Smollett walked into an apartment building and past security, without informing anyone about the alleged assault, and he kept the rope around his neck for some three-quarters of an hour. He neglected to tell the police about the MAGA remark in this first interview, revealing it only later in a subsequent interview. He took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital that morning and was released later in the morning. TMZ posted a picture of Smollett with a small scratch or cut beneath his right eye.

That’s pretty much all we know. Here’s hoping we find out more."

Police are investigating the assault as a hate crime, and Hart is still fresh from dropping out as Oscars host after the resurfacing of past homophobic tweets. He apologized multiple times but then made a pretty messy visit to GMA to promote The Upside. There, he emphatically (and repeatedly) insisted that he’s “over it” and wouldn’t do anything further to stress that those remarks are in the past, and he’s changed, and “I shouldn’t have to prove who I am.”

Still, The Upside fared well at the box office, so it didn’t seem that Hart’s career would suffer. Along with many other entertainers who expressed support for Smollett — after he was reportedly assaulted by two men yelling homophobic and racial slurs and who put a noose around his neck — Hart sent prayers to the Empire actor on Instagram whole urging people to “forever choose love.”

“Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting,” he wrote. “We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

Hart linked to the post on Twitter, where users were quick to point out out to him that jokes like the ones he previously made are indeed harmful and can eventually influence people to commit future hate-inspired actions.

I “harp” because my community of black queer people face violence 365 in America and when we tried to tell you that we weren’t trolling you but wanted to educate how your jokes lead to actions like what happened to Jussie, you went on Ellen to talk about your wheelchair movie. https://t.co/bGXkNVQsTl — Ira (@ira) January 31, 2019

Do you see why the “jokes” weren’t funny now?? — Bethany West (@niale_west) January 30, 2019

After many, many tweets resembling the above, Hart spoke out again. “I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person,” he wrote. “Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do…CHANGE!”"

At a press conference Thursday, the president was asked to comment about the reportedly racist and homophobic Jan. 29 assault on the actor, which Chicago police are investigating as a “possible hate crime.”

“That I can tell you is horrible,” Trump said. “I’ve seen it. Last night. It’s horrible. Doesn’t get worse.”

The president did not address that the actor’s attackers allegedly yelled during the attack “this is MAGA country,” a reference to Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan.

Following his brief comments on Smollett, he then segued into a discussion of immigration from Mexico, which he dubbed “the worst thing of all,” and a renewed call for a border wall.

Reports about the attack have generated an outpouring of sympathy for the actor and outrage over the incident. Smollett checked himself into a hospital early Tuesday but has since been released and is scheduled to perform in Los Angeles this weekend. Fox’s Empire has temporarily suspended production, but that’s due to the Midwest’s extreme cold.

Meanwhile, Chicago Police have released video surveillance images of shadowy figures they call “people of interest” in the case. The duo was reportedly on the same street as Smollett when the incident occurred. Various footage collected by police have shown the actor walking home without showing an assault, but there are also still gaps in the footage.

While the “MAGA country” yell wasn’t initially part of the actor’s statement to police, Smollett’s manager Brandon Z. Moore told Variety he was on the phone with the actor and heard some of the attack — including the words “MAGA country.” “I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,” Moore said. Smollett later confirmed the taunt as well."

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said in a statement.

The suspects were described as two males who were wearing black clothing. One suspect was reported to be wearing a black mask and the allegedly shouted “MAGA country” and other MAGA affiliations.

President Donald Trump finally commented on the attack on ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett.

Trump was asked about the incident on Thursday by reporter April Ryan. Before she could mention the allegation the attackers mentioned ""MAGA"" during the assault, Trump answered, ""That, I can tell you, is horrible.""

He continued, ""I think that's horrible. It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.""

Trump then somehow transitioned his answer to be about the wall and drugs.

On Wednesday night, police released a photo of the potential suspects, which shows two men wearing dark clothing. Detectives are reviewing more camera, but are looking to question the two individuals seen in the photo.

Police say the two people were seen walking near the location of the incident between 1:30 AM and 1:45 AM and are trying to determine if they witnessed the incident, or were possibly involved.

As we reported, police have been combing the area near Smollett’s luxury high-rise apartment ever since he claims to have been attacked in a racial and homophobic-fueled tirade.

Jussie Smollett was seen with a cut under his eye after video chatting with “Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels. The star also claims a noose was put around his neck and bleach thrown at his face during the early morning assault.

Police make it clear they want to speak with the two people seen in the video, but they have not yet been identified.

“That, I can tell you, is horrible. I’ve seen it, last night. I think that's horrible,” the president told reporters during an event at the White House. “It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.”

Chicago police are investigating the attack against Smollett as a possible hate crime. Smollett, who is black and gay, told police that on Tuesday morning, two white men beat him, poured bleach on him, and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. One of the suspects wrapped a rope around his neck, Smollett said.

He was taken to the hospital after the attack.

Following the incident, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., blamed Trump and accused him of stoking racial animus.

“I’m pleased that he’s doing OK. But we have to understand this is happening for a reason. Why all of a sudden do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have a picnic while black, and being attacked?” Waters told The Grio in an interview. “It’s coming from the president of the United States. He’s dog whistling every day. He’s separating and dividing, and he is basically emboldening those folks who feel this way.”"

“I can tell you that it’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” Trump said in response to a question on Thursday from April Ryan, Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks.

The Chicago Police Department has released two images from surveillance video of “potential persons of interest” in the attack of Smollett.

The attack is being characterized as a possible hate crime, and involved two men yelling out “racial and homophobic slurs” at Smollett, pouring an “unknown chemical substance” on him, and wrapping a rope around his neck, according to the Chicago Police Department. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett also told investigators that he heard attackers shout “MAGA country.” MAGA stands for Make America Great Again, President Trump’s campaign slogan.

ABC News reported on Thursday that police obtained video that shows Smollett walking across the street from two possible “persons of interest.” For about a minute, Smollett walked out of the frame and “reappears on another camera ‘wearing a rope like a neck tie.'” The network also reported that Smollett has declined to hand over his cell phone to detectives.

Chicago police released photos of the “persons of interest” on Wednesday. They said that the people were “in area of the alleged assault & battery,” which took place early on Tuesday morning.

Smollett’s music manager said that he was on the phone with the actor at the time he was attacked, and that he heard some of what transpired.

The manager, Brandon Z. Moore, told Variety that he gave his account to police authorities, but declined to go into details because it is an active investigation.

Moore told Variety that he heard those words “MAGA country” being used. “I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,” he said.

Smollett transported himself to Northwestern University hospital and was listed in good condition. He is still scheduled to perform Saturday night at Los Angeles’ Troubadour."

President Donald Trump also weighed in Thursday, calling the assault “horrible” in response to a question at an Oval Office event.

Chicago police are still conducting a hate crime investigation and on Wednesday evening released the first surveillance images of two persons of interest captured on camera around the time and in the area of the brutal attack.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, was walking back to his Streeterville home about 2 a.m. after a stop at a Subway restaurant when two men walked up to him, yelled racist and homophobic slurs, poured what is suspected to be bleach on him and put a rope around his neck.

Smollett told police the assailants were two men wearing ski-masks and all black clothing. In a follow-up interview, he told detectives the men yelled “this is MAGA country” after they beat him, a police spokesman said.

Smollett and his manager both told officers they were on the phone when the attack started, police said. His manager reportedly overheard much of the hateful statements.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.” Smollett’s family said in the statement. “Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. … Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

The family’s statement also blamed heated rhetoric around the country and said similar hate crimes will continue “until we hold each other accountable.

“Hateful words lead to hateful actions,” the statement said. “Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

Earlier Thursday, Trump took questions from pool reporters on a variety of topics in an Oval Office event. Reporter April Ryan of American Urban Radio asked Trump about Smollett.

“That I can tell you was horrible,” Trump responded. “It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned.”

The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said she saw the man pacing between the building’s entrance and parking garage while she walked her dog at around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday. According to Smollett’s neighbor, the man appeared agitated and “out of place” as he puffed on a cigarette. She said he was a white male with “scruff on his face” wearing a blue winter hat, a blue hoodie, and jeans. The alleged assailant also wore “thick, grey hunting socks,” which the neighbor said she could see because his jeans were ill-fitted, along with “camel-colored” shoes.

TMZ reported:

She says she noticed what looked like a rope, or a clothesline, protruding from the bottom of his sweatshirt, made of white and blue material. She says he was staring at another man about 300 feet away, who was standing near another entrance to the building. She says she got “creeped out” by the man, and after 5 minutes she retreated back into the building.

TMZ previously reported that the alleged assailants wore ski masks. Smollett’s neighbor did not corroborate this detail.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi shared two photos of the “persons of interest” on Wednesday night.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the popular Fox television program, alleges two men beat him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs and covered him in an “unknown chemical substance.” The actor claims that the attackers asked him, “Aren’t you that faggot ‘Empire’ n***r?” and placed a rope around his neck before leaving the scene. Smollett’s manager Brandon Moore claims to have been on the phone with the actor during the alleged attack and “clearly” heard the assailants shout “This is MAGA country.”

However, Smollett’s call logs have not been verified as the actor refused to turn over his cell phone to law enforcement for review, ABC 7 reporter Rob Elgas said Wednesday evening.

After the incident, the actor said he phoned his manager at his apartment, who then notified police of the alleged attack roughly 40 minutes later. Upon arrival, the officer found Smollett had several cuts on his face and was still wearing around his neck.

Police said detectives, who are looking into the alleged incident as a possible hate crime, have reviewed “hundreds of hours” of video from cameras around the area. “We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said."

And his comments prove that the bond between the Mighty Ducks alums is seemingly unbreakable.

While discussing some of Thompson's recent accomplishments, which include winning an Emmy, host Jimmy Fallon honed in on the actor's role in Ducks franchise, prompting the former Nickelodeon entertainer to share his heartfelt thoughts to both Smollett and his family. “Speaking of,” Thompson interjected as Fallon began to relive the glory of the '90s action films. “We should send some love to Jussie Smollett ‘cause he is a Mighty Duck.” He went on to say that he initially thought about posting something about the vicious attack on Smollett via his newly created Instagram page, but felt that the moment deserved a ""way bigger platform."" Thompson then sent ""a lot of love to the Smollett family"" and “to the universe"" saying, ""This kind of madness needs to stop.”

For those who may not remember, before starring on Empire, Smollett played the role of Terry Hall in the original Mighty Ducks film. Unfortunately, he never starred alongside Thompson’s character, Russ Tyler, who appeared in Mighty Ducks 2 and 3. But that doesn't mean that Thompson doesn't seem them as part of the same Mighty Ducks family. It's a family that is very dear to the SNL star's heart. In fact, during his sit down with Fallon, Thompson revealed that he recently spent time with some of his former co-stars at a hockey game earlier this month, telling the talks show host, ""we just had a Mighty Ducks reunion and a couple of us got together.""

Thompson wasn't the only one of Smollett's costars to express their feelings on the brutal attack. Smollett's TV mother Taraji P. Henson, supported him in powerful social media post. The message, which featured Smollett's politically and socially charged song and music video ""F.U.W."", was shared on Instagram and revealed Henson's reaction to the incident. Her caption read in part:

""I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now. @jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.""

Terrence Howard, who plays Smollett's father on Empire, also shared his thoughts on Wednesday, Jan. 30. Per Entertainment Tonight, he told Good Morning America:

""I heard he's getting better. He’s angry, but I know Jussie. Jussie's anger will dissipate, and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.""

Smollett, who is openly gay and plays the openly gay character Jamal Lyon on Fox's Empire, was reportedly attacked in Chicago on Jan. 29 by two unknown people, who allegedly hit the actor repeatedly and poured an ""unknown chemical"" on him, according to a Chicago Police Department statement shared by HuffPost's Front Page Editor, Philip Lewis. The actor was hospitalized following the attack. According to ABC News, Smollett additionally told police that the attackers yelled ""MAGA country"" during the brutal assault. On Jan. 30, police released several images of ""potential persons of interest,"" but no arrests have been made."

Smollett claimed two men beat him up, tied a noose around his neck, said racial and homophobic slurs and threw an unknown chemical substance on him Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.

Brandon Z. Moore, Smollett’s music manager, said he heard some of the attack while on the phone with Smollett, according to Variety.

“I heard that clearly,” Moore said. “I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur.”

TMZ reported Tuesday the attackers were white men wearing ski masks who poured bleach on Smollett and screamed “This is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country.” Smollett reportedly had a fractured rib as well.

Police said the actor did not initially disclose the “MAGA country” comment, but confirmed it in a second interview.

Guglielmi added Moore claimed in the follow-up interview that he heard the “MAGA country” phrase, ABC7 reported.

Police were notified 40 minutes after the attack and found Smollett in his apartment with cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around the actor’s neck, according to AP. Smollett asked police to shut down the body cameras as he explained why the rope was around his neck.

Smollett was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and was in “good condition,” according to People Tuesday.

Guglielmi said Tuesday evening they could not find video evidence of Smollett getting attacked. Police expanded their search area and found “people of interest” Wednesday, according to a tweet by Guglielmi.

CHICAGO -- The Latest on the attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett (all times local)

3:30 p.m.

The family of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett says that they have no doubt that the actor is a victim of a ""racial and homophobic hate crime.""

In a statement released via one of Smollett's representatives, the family seems to dispute any suggestion that Smollett wasn't truthful with police when he reported that two men in masks beat him early Tuesday, hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, threw an undetermined chemical on him and looped a rope around his neck. The family says Smollett has told police ""everything"" and that his account of what happened has ""never changed.""

Such doubts have been expressed online as police have reported that they have not yet located any surveillance video of the attack and that Smollett declined to turn over phone records that would show he was talking to his agent on the phone at the time of the attack, as he told detectives. Police have said that Smollett has been cooperative.

Police continued to gather and analyze surveillance video Thursday and reported that video from Smollett's apartment building shows that he had a thin rope around his neck when he arrived after he says he was beaten up.

President Donald Trump says he's seen the reports about the racially-charged attack in Chicago on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett and described what happened as ""horrible.""

Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday that he saw the story the night before and that, ""It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned."" The president's Trump International Hotel & Tower is in the general area where the attack took place.

Smollett, who is gay and black, told police that two masked men attacked him early Tuesday as he was walking home from a Subway restaurant. He says they beat him, hurled racial and homophobic insults at him, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Police are gathering and reviewing video from scores of surveillance cameras in the area. They have recovered video that shows Smollett arriving home with a rope around his neck, but they have not found video of the attack itself.

They have also released photographs from videos of two people walking in the area about the time of the attack in the hopes that those people can be located and provide them more information about what happened.

Chicago police have recovered more surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking before and after he says he was attacked by two masked men, but they haven't found video of the attack.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi (goo-lee-EHL'-mee) also said Thursday that Smollett and his manager say they were talking on the phone when he was attacked at 2 a.m. Tuesday, but that Smollett has declined to hand his phone records to police.

Police released images Wednesday of two people who were walking in the area around that time Tuesday, but Guglielmi stresses that they are not considered suspects and are being sought because they were in the vicinity.

Hart shared a lengthy message of encouragement for Smollett one day after the Empire star was beaten in the streets of Chicago by two white men in ski masks allegedly shouting: 'This is MAGA country.'

His post was quickly met with backlash from fans highlighting the Ride Along star's history of homophobic jokes and tweets, which recently led to him dropping out as host of The Oscars.

Hart responded to the critics in a tweet Wednesday afternoon, writing: 'I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person.

'Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do...CHANGE!'

Kevin Hart responded to critics who dug up his past homophobic remarks after the comedian expressed his support for actor Jussie Smollett following his alleged hate-crime attack

The comedian's messages of encouragement on Twitter and Instagram were met with backlash from fans who accused Hart (above on January 9) of being hypocritical

Hart had shared the photo above of Smollett on Instagram one day after the Empire actor was beaten up by two white men in ski masks who allegedly shouted: 'This is MAGA country'

Smollett, who came out as gay to Ellen in 2015, was jumped by two men as he walking from a local Subway sandwich shop and the two men started yelling homophobic and racial slurs including: 'Aren't you the f***ot 'Empire' n*****?'

The actor suffered a fractured rib during the attack and is said to have put up a fight as he was beaten, had bleach poured on him and a noose put around his neck.

Thousands of fans, colleagues and friends reached out to Smollett to express their love and support in the wake of the assault.

Among them was Hart, who wrote on Instagram and Twitter: 'Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad.

'Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.'

Dozens of critics responded to the post by reminding Hart of comments he made between 2009 and 2011, in which he joked that if he caught his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he would 'break it over his head and say in my voice ""stop that's gay""'.

Television writer and host of Crooked Media podcast Keep It Ira Madison was among the critics who responded to Hart's posts by reminding him of jokes he made between 2009 and 2011, in which he said that if he caught his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he would 'break it over his head and say in my voice ""stop that's gay""'

Filmmaker Sam Greisman also posted a scathing response to Hart's comments on Twitter

Jonathan Van Ness, who stars on the highly-popular Netflix series Queer Eye, tweeted about Hart's controversial appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres show

Poet Saeed Jones also blasted both Hart and DeGeneres in a tweet

Ira Madison, a television writer and host of Crooked Media podcast Keep It, tweeted: 'This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny.'

Filmmaker and son of Sally Field Sam Greisman wrote: 'But keep joking about beating up your kid for being gay, Kevin Hart!'

As Ellen DeGeneres supported Hart after dropping out of the gig, which created another controversy, many blasted the both of them for their posts.

Jonathan Van Ness who stars on highly-popular Netflix series Queer Eye tweeted: 'The hate crime that happened today is an attack on us all. Queer people of color need allies, queer people need allies. Kevin Hart so quiet right now. Where are the allies Ellen? Maga hat wearing people need to be checked - we gotta WAKE UP people, it’s going down.'

Poet Saeed Jones wrote: 'Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks. Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart.'

Smollett, who came out as gay to Ellen in 2015, was jumped by two men as he walking from a local Subway sandwich shop and the two men started yelling homophobic and racial slurs including: 'Aren't you the f***ot 'Empire' n*****?'

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, that appears to be dated from January 18, stating that 'You will die black f*g'. Fox Studio received the letter on the 22nd and cops said it was laced with powder Tylenol

Hart was named as the host of the 91st Academy Awards in December. He took proudly to social media afterwards to announce it but his elation was short-lived.

Within days, Twitter users had unearthed his old tweets and demanded that he be removed.

Among them were posts where he labeled people 'f**gs' and jokes about what he would do if his son came out as gay.

Despite the backlash, Hart refused to apologize and instead quit over the controversy, blindsiding the Academy and leaving them without a host.

He said the Oscars gave him an ultimatum; apologize or give up the gig. He chose the latter.

Later, he appeared on Ellen where both he and she called for viewers to embrace growth and change.

During their interview, she revealed that she had even called the Academy to ask if Hart could still host the show and said she was told he could.

Ellen, who has long been an icon in the LGBTQ community, was lampooned for throwing her support behind the comedian afterwards.

Hart later came to her defense, saying: 'When did we get to the point where we forgot that we all learn, then we all have the ability to grow and with that growth comes a wealth of knowledge.

'You can’t change without a understanding of what GROWTH means.'

Hart has been under fire for the past several weeks over his years-old homophobic jokes and tweets, which recently led to him dropping out as host of The Oscars"

- Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh has shared really interesting details concerning her friendship with Mercy Johnson

- According to her, their relationship turned sour only because she got envious of the mother of three

- She revealed that it was because she thought Mercy Johnson was a better actress than her

It takes guts for anyone to admit wrong doing especially publicly. Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, seems to have eliminated all the ego in her based on her most recent post about Mercy Johnson.

Talking about how their friendship turned sour, the 33-year-old actress stated in a post shared on Instagram that she has always been envious of Mercy and thought she was a better actress than her. She revealed that it was what sparked her bad attitude towards Johnson in the past.

However, all that is over now as she has realised that being one's self instead of wanting to be someone else is the best way to live. Tonto's post is making waves online and many fans have shown admiration for her confidence and peace-making spirit.

Read her post below

Recall that the feud between the two top actresses started with Tonto Dikeh's angry outbursts on social media, in which she accused Johnson of being a neglectful mother.

It was back in 2013, after Mercy had her child and resumed acting when her daughter was only a few months old. Tonto claimed that Mercy abandoned her child when it needed her the most because of film-making.

Johnson of course did not receive the insults well and it escalated into a dramatic social media brouhaha that made them sworn enemies.

Following her most recent statement, it is now clear that Dikeh was only envious of the screen goddess returning to the limelight.

Luckily, they have patched things up and all that is now in the past now.

Meanwhile, recently, Dikeh took to weighing in on social media and the fake lifestyles it promotes. Tonto said that pictures were easily deceiving so Nigerians should beware of how easily they believe what they see.

According to the screen diva, no one should be distracted by the glamorous lifestyle of people rather they should stay focused on their own ambitions.

This just proves that I, like most Americans, am a racist. As we all know by now, Smollett is an actor on the once-highly rated FOX drama Empire, where he plays supporting character Jamal Lyon. Who is some sort of singer, I think? I’ve never seen the show, for which I of course profusely apologize. But I’m sure it’s a very good television program, and I’m equally certain that Mr. Smollett is a fine actor.

Smollett says he was attacked on a Chicago street around 2 a.m. Tuesday, on one of the coldest nights in the city’s history. Sandra Gonzalez, CNN:

Smollett was attacked by two people who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” and “poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” police said.

One of Smollett’s alleged attackers also put a rope around his neck, according to police. Both fled the scene…

A dozen police detectives, with the assistance of the FBI, are working the case…

A dozen cops, with help from the FBI. I’ll bet they’d be putting twice as many guys on the case if Smollett were white. But it’s a good start.

It was originally reported that the alleged assailants yelled “This is MAGA country” during the attack. Then the Chicago PD said Smollett never told them that. Then the Chicago PD said oh wait, yeah, he did tell them that. So… that seems pretty weird, right?

As Patrick Poole notes, despite all the manpower being thrown at the case, there’s not a lot in terms of evidence. Even with all the surveillance cameras in the area, this is the closest they’ve come to a break:

Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member. While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed pic.twitter.com/xJDDygtocr — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) January 31, 2019

As you can see, the persons of interest are bipedal, possibly male or female, with no visible amputations. The police can rule out anybody who’s in a wheelchair or a coffin.

Then there’s this little detail:

A consideration regarding the “potential persons of interest” being sought by police in connection with reported hate crime incident in Streeterville: The men are walking *away* from the attack scene 15-30 minutes *before* the incident, per police timing of events. — CWBChicago (@CWBChicago) January 31, 2019

Well, we all know how sneaky and underhanded those Trump supporters can be. Is it really outside the realm of possibility that they broke the rules of time and space to carry out this violent attack? Couldn’t they be MAGAcians?

Smollett is no Trump fan, which is no surprise for a working actor. What is surprising is that he’s been publicly seething about Trump even longer than most of his peers:

That first one is from December 2011. How many people were this angry about Trump all the way back in December 2011? Yeah, there was the birther stuff, but that was 9-10 months before. Maybe Smollett was still carrying a grudge about it? Now, that’s not to say he’s now making up an attack by Trump supporters, but he’s not exactly an unbiased observer of current events.

And the outlandish details of the alleged assault don’t inspire confidence either. Two Trump supporters were out for a walk in the middle of the coldest night in Chicago history. For some reason, they were armed with a noose and an “unknown chemical substance.” They saw Smollett, recognized him from TV, and decided then and there to attack him. And so far, there’s no evidence to support any of it.

I know it’s racist and homophobic of me, but I’m going to reserve judgment on this one.

Less than two weeks ago, we were all supposed to be outraged that some kids in MAGA hats attacked a Native American gentleman in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Then it turned out that nobody attacked anybody, but by then the Catholic school those kids attend had to shut down because of all the death threats. That was a MAGA hat in search of a crime, and now we have a possible crime in search of a MAGA hat.

Look, I don’t know what happened to Jussie Smollett. Maybe he’s telling us what he sincerely remembers happening. I’ve been assaulted on a city street — moving away from Washington, D.C., is the best decision I’ve ever made — and I know how stressful and confusing the experience is. Even when the injuries heal and the physical pain subsides, it’s still traumatic. It’s awful, and I don’t wish it on anybody. I hope Smollett makes a speedy recovery.

But it seems premature to blame Trump supporters, or Trump, or anybody other than the alleged culprits. Where’s the harm in waiting for the facts to come in?

Or even a single fact at all?"

CHICAGO (AP) — The Latest on the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett (all times local)

3:30 p.m.

The family of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett says that they have no doubt that the actor is a victim of a “racial and homophobic hate crime.”

In a statement released via one of Smollett’s representatives, the family seems to dispute any suggestion that Smollett wasn’t truthful with police when he reported that two men in masks beat him early Tuesday, hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, threw an undetermined chemical on him and looped a rope around his neck. The family says Smollett has told police “everything” and that his account of what happened has “never changed.”

Such doubts have been expressed online as police have reported that they have not yet located any surveillance video of the attack and that Smollett declined to turn over phone records that would show he was talking to his agent on the phone at the time of the attack, as he told detectives. Police have said that Smollett has been cooperative.

Police continued to gather and analyze surveillance video Thursday and reported that video from Smollett’s apartment building shows that he had a thin rope around his neck when he arrived after he says he was beaten up.

1 p.m.

President Donald Trump says he’s seen the reports about the racially-charged attack in Chicago on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett and described what happened as “horrible.”

Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday that he saw the story the night before and that, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.” The president’s Trump International Hotel & Tower is in the general area where the attack took place.

Smollett, who is gay and black, told police that two masked men attacked him early Tuesday as he was walking home from a Subway restaurant. He says they beat him, hurled racial and homophobic insults at him, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Police are gathering and reviewing video from scores of surveillance cameras in the area. They have recovered video that shows Smollett arriving home with a rope around his neck, but they have not found video of the attack itself.

They have also released photographs from videos of two people walking in the area about the time of the attack in the hopes that those people can be located and provide them more information about what happened.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there are hundreds of surveillance cameras in the area, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants, and that the hope is that detectives will be able to piece them together to capture most if not all of Smollett’s trip from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at about 2 a.m. Tuesday, when Smollett said the attack occurred.

Guglielmi said piecing together the private and public surveillance video is tedious work that is made more difficult by the fact that the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi also said police have recovered video that shows the 36-year-old actor walking into his apartment, but that he hasn’t seen it and doesn’t know if Smollett appeared to be in any distress when he arrived home.

He said that Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that Smollett declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations."

CHICAGO - The Latest on the attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett (all times local)

3:30 p.m.

The family of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett says that they have no doubt that the actor is a victim of a ""racial and homophobic hate crime.""

In a statement released via one of Smollett's representatives, the family seems to dispute any suggestion that Smollett wasn't truthful with police when he reported that two men in masks beat him early Tuesday, hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, threw an undetermined chemical on him and looped a rope around his neck. The family says Smollett has told police ""everything"" and that his account of what happened has ""never changed.""

Such doubts have been expressed online as police have reported that they have not yet located any surveillance video of the attack and that Smollett declined to turn over phone records that would show he was talking to his agent on the phone at the time of the attack, as he told detectives. Police have said that Smollett has been co-operative.

Police continued to gather and analyze surveillance video Thursday and reported that video from Smollett's apartment building shows that he had a thin rope around his neck when he arrived after he says he was beaten up.

1 p.m.

President Donald Trump says he's seen the reports about the racially-charged attack in Chicago on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett and described what happened as ""horrible.""

Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday that he saw the story the night before and that, ""It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned."" The president's Trump International Hotel & Tower is in the general area where the attack took place.

Smollett, who is gay and black, told police that two masked men attacked him early Tuesday as he was walking home from a Subway restaurant. He says they beat him, hurled racial and homophobic insults at him, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Police are gathering and reviewing video from scores of surveillance cameras in the area. They have recovered video that shows Smollett arriving home with a rope around his neck, but they have not found video of the attack itself.

They have also released photographs from videos of two people walking in the area about the time of the attack in the hopes that those people can be located and provide them more information about what happened.

Starring the six Smollett siblings (including Jurnee, previously seen as Denise Frazier on Miller/Boyett's co-production, Full House) and comedian Ralph Louis Harris, it sadly only lasted one season (1994-95) on ABC. It was co-produced by Suzanne de Passe and David W. Duclon's Lightkeeper Productions. 2010-10-05T02:04:36.000Z

In 1994, all five of the Smollett siblings starred in the ABC sitcom, “On Our Own.” The show lasted for one season, until April 1995. The show which starred, Ralph Louis Harris, saw the siblings dealing with the sudden death of their parents in St. Louis. Smollett’s sister said in an interview that production “was like heaven.” She added, “We all were in the same school trailer. We would eat hot links and bagels for breakfast every morning — very black and Jewish of us.”

In total, 20 episodes of the series were aired. Harris played the Smollett’s eldest sibling, who was charged with raising them while donning drag in front of the children’s social worker to pretend to be an elderly aunt. The show’s IMDb page referred to Harris as performing in “Madea-style drag.” The show was created by David W. Duclon.

2. The Smollett Children Were ‘Raised in the Orbit of the Black Panthers’

The New York Times published a feature on Smollett and his family in March 2016. The article described the Smollett children as being “raised in the orbit of the Black Panthers.” It adds that the family has recently “lent their voices” to the Black Lives Matter movement.

Smollett told the Times in 2016 that his mother is African-American and is originally from New Orleans. She met his father in the Bay Area, where Joel Smollett Sr. lived. Smollett said, “My mom was in the movement with Bobby Seale and Huey Newton, and one of her first mentors was Julian Bond. To this day, Angela Davis is one of her dearest friends. We’ve spent Mother’s Day with Angela.” During the same interview, Smollett referred to the families dietary habits as “Blewish.”

3. Smollett’s Father Died After a Battle With Cancer in 2014 on the Day ‘Empire’ Premiered

Smollett’s father died after a battle with cancer in the winter of 2014. Smollett made the sad announcement on Instagram. Smollett wrote under a photo of his father holding him as a baby, “Yesterday, January 7, 2015, my family lost our king but we gained a righteous angel. You showed the deepest strength and dignity until your very last breath. You are not just a fighter… You are the CHAMP.”

4. Jurnee Smollett Is Married to Canadian Singer/Songwriter Josiah Bell

Smollett’s sister, Jurnee, is married to Canadian singer/songwriter Josiah Bell. The couple was married in October 2010 in the Los Angeles botanical gardens, Jurnee told Essence in a feature. Speaking about her relationship in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Jurnee said, “We were best friends before we started even dating, so we had this really great foundation. I think one of the challenging things about any lasting relationship is that you have to be so vulnerable. I think as human beings we try to hide our flaws and try to present this perfect person, this person we wish we were to our spouse when that causes so many troubles.”

Speaking about his sister to the Times, Smollett said she was a “mix of Diana Ross and Elizabeth Taylor. She was boss from the beginning.” by the time she was one. Jurnee appeared in her husband’s music video for “Smoke and Mirrors.” Jurnee gave birth to the couple’s first child, Hunter Zion, in November 2016.

5.Smollett’s Brother, Jake, Is a Renowned Celebrity Chef

Smollett’s oldest sibling, JoJo, works at a non-profit. One of his younger brothers, Jocqui, works in IT, his sister Jazz works in production while another brother Jake is a chef. Jake Smollett has appeared multiple times on “The Rachel Ray Show,” according to his IMDb page. Jake was a prolific actor in the 1990s and mid-200s with numerous credits. He hasn’t acted since 2009.

On his official website, Jake wrote, “I grew up in a family of eight: Five siblings and our parents. We jokingly call ourselves a farm family because would make a home-cooked meal that we would all collectively prepare, and eat together on a table that my mom built by hand.” Smollett bragged about his cooking abilities in a March 2015 interview with Vanity Fair saying, “I’m a very inviting guy and I like to cook a lot. My mom is from New Orleans, so I feel like I’m a Southern boy at heart and there’s always cooking. You can always come to my house and I will cook for you… Darling, there’s nothing I cannot make. I make the best macaroni and cheese that you will ever have in your life and I make a mean gumbo. It’s mean!”

Smollett told the Times that it was Jazz who heard about the casting for “Empire” and sent him the notice.

Smollett said of his siblings in a 2016 ABC News interview, “We’re a very close family, a functioning family, instead of dysfunctional… No one’s ever loved me in spite of who I am. They’ve always loved me because of who I am.”

“That I can tell you is horrible,” the former Celebrity Apprentice host said Thursday when asked about the racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett that seemingly occurred early Tuesday morning. “It doesn’t get worse,” the president added.

The blunt remarks by Trump come hours after police in the currently frozen Windy City released video surveillance images of what they call “people of interest” in the January 29 barrage on Smollett from two as yet-unidentified individuals.

Having just returned to the city where the Fox drama is shot, Smollett was on the street near his Chicago apartment at around 2 AM when two men began bellowing derogatory slurs toward him. The duo then attacked the actor, hitting him over and over and pouring an unknown chemical substance over him. They reportedly also put a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene.

After reporting the incident to police and conducting an initial interview with them, Smollett drove himself to Northwestern Hospital. He returned to his home under increased security later Tuesday and was said to be in good condition, police said.

Chicago police announced on Tuesday that they are treating the matter as a “possible hate crime.”

Smollett’s music manager Brandon Z. Moore is among those who say that the attackers were screaming “this is MAGA country” at the actor who plays the openly gay Jamel Lyon on the Taraji P. Henson- and Terrence Howard-led Empire. “Make America Great Again” is, of course, Trump’s defining rallying cry and remains his go-to phrase on the stump or in the Oval Office. The president did not address the use of that term by the attackers, and that has not been confirmed by Chicago police.

Although trauma counselors were on-hand for Empire cast, crew and producers on Tuesday after the assault on Smollett became known, the show went on hiatus soon afterward. That break is not due to Smollett’s situation but because of the harsh cold of the polar vortex that hit Chicago and much of the Midwest this week. The weather is still bone-chillingly cold in the Windy City, but Empire and fellow locally shot Fox series Proven Innocent are both back in production today, I hear.

Depending on his recovery and weather conditions, Smollett could be back filming Empire by early next week. The performer is still scheduled to play a concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on Saturday."

After confirming his sexual orientation on “Ellen” in 2015, he’s advocated for HIV awareness for years, and even pushed for an HIV-centric plot line on “Empire.” He’s also recently championed fundraising efforts to save Bennett College, one of only two women-only HBCUs in existence.

His example as an out, Black LGBT person portraying out LGBT people in popular culture is one among many, when in previous years he might have been seen as a token or a character actor.

“Moonlight,” for instance, centered a Black man’s coming-of-age struggles with sexuality and identity and won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2017. “Pose,” which has picked up a host of Golden Globe and Critics’ Choice award nominations, offers a heartwarming glimpse into 1980s ball culture within Black and Latinx communities, and made TV history for having the largest cast of transgender series regulars. And, while reacting to her Grammy nod for Album of the Year, Janelle Monae said she created “Dirty Computer” as a young, Black and queer woman who wanted to celebrate her people.

But while Smollett and others entertain the masses, their work matters particularly to Black LGBT people who seek sources of inspiration as they endure the everyday push and pull of multiple, concurrent forms of prejudice.

That’s why an attack on Smollett struck Black and LGBT people at a deep, visceral level — which had led to an outpouring of support from allies as well.

Just over a week ago, a letter addressed to “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett arrived at the Chicago studios where the show is filmed; pictures show that included a poorly-rendered sketch of a man hanging from a tree, along with a threat: “You will die Black f*g.”

Then (though law enforcement has yet to find a connection between the two incidents), on Tuesday morning, Smollett called police from a friend’s house shortly before 3 a.m., wearing a rope around his neck. He reportedly told them, with injuries on his face and around his neck, that two masked attackers approached him on a nearby street shouting epithets, hit him, doused him with bleach and put the rope around his neck. In a later interview with police, he confirmed news reports that they yelled “this is MAGA country” as they fled; his music manager, who says he was on the phone with Smollett at the time, confirmed to police that he heard the racial slurs.

Smollett has yet to make a public statement about his trauma, but the reported threats and the attack triggered the generational traumas of two historically oppressed groups – Black people and LGBT people — and demonstrated one way in which Black LGBT people live with both enduring legacies at the same time.

Take the LGBT community for example: The mainstream LGBT movement as we know it today sprang in part from the 1969 Stonewall Riots, where patrons of the gay bar, routinely targeted by discriminatory police raids, forcefully resisted the officers who kept violating one of their few safe spaces. Anti-gay hate crimes took center stage in 1998 after the murder of 21-year-old Matthew Shepard, a gay college student who was lured out of a bar, tied to a fence and tortured to death by two men in Wyoming.

Same-sex sexual activity meant risking arrest and prosecution in several states, until the 2003 landmark ruling in Lawrence v. Texas made it legal nationwide. And while same-sex marriage became the law of the land in 2015, “bathroom bills” have now emerged to keep transgender people from using the restroom most appropriate for them, with one West Virginia principal recently suspended for harassing a trans student about it.

Black people’s experiences with state and interpersonal violence runs even deeper. Slave traders and owners ripped families apart, beat and sexually abused laborers into submission, and enforced the system through patrols and the threat of death. Even after slavery was abolished, widespread lynchings inflicted racial terror and white mobs destroyed Black businesses, all in an attempt to keep Black people on society’s lower rungs. “Sundown towns” under Jim Crow made traveling a fearful prospect for Black people, who faced police harassment, intimidation and violence if they were caught traversing past sunset. And that legacy persists today, with stop-and-frisks and police shootings disproportionately targeting Black people, per studies.

And while the Black and LGBT communities have distinct histories of trauma, it converges upon Black LGBT people, who must bear the weight of it all at the same time. Black LGBT people live at the intersections of both identities. We experience high rates of violent hate crimes, including and especially Black transgender women, as reports show. Black men who have sex with men have an HIV prevalence rate 16 time higher than their white counterparts, a striking health disparity that ties back to the government’s refusal to addressing the illness during its initial rise in the 1980s, and myth that HIV was only a problem for white gay men. It’s why people like Smollett advocate for HIV awareness and resources in a community that’s still reeling from an epidemic otherwise thought of as a specter of yesteryear.

Black LGBT people not only face violence and discrimination from the outside, they also often contend with prejudice from within two broader communities that they share — whether it’s racism from their white LGBT counterparts or anti-queer ignorance from Black people who are heterosexual and cisgender. Perhaps this is why many of the initial headlines about Smollett’s attack noted either the issues of race or sexuality at play in the details, but not often both at the same time.

Even with the increased Black LGBT representation in mainstream culture, the community’s strong, vocal response to the attack on Smollett underscores the unity and resilience of a people whose forbearers have fought and struggled for us to arrive at this present moment. These legacies inform the deep psychic harm inflicted by violence against one of our own, because we know Smollett could’ve been any one of us — and that many others like him don’t survive to tell the tale. The trauma isn’t the beginning and end of the story, and we, like those who came before, will persist."

He’s dog-whistling every day.”

Waters began by noting she was friends with Smollett, saying, “I know Jussie. I love him. His family’s a friend of mine. I know his sisters, I’ve met his mom, and I called already to Jazz, one of the sisters, to talk to her about what’s happening, what’s going on. So she said he’s okay, he’s out of the hospital. We didn’t talk about it much more than that, but I was on my way to Chicago to see about him. You know what I’m saying? I love him; he’s a fantastic human being; he’s so giving. He shows up at all the community events; he does a lot working with the community, but he comes from that kind of family. And so, I’m pleased that he’s doing okay.”

Then she segued to attacking the president:

But we have to understand this is happening for a reason. Why all of a sudden do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have a picnic while black, and being attacked? It’s coming from the President of the United States. He’s dog-whistling every day. He’s separating and dividing, and he is basically emboldening those folks who feel this way, maybe never said and never talked about it, never could act it out, but now they’re on it.

Waters concluded, “When I heard about what had happened to Jussie, and I heard they put a rope around him, and they poured bleach on him and stuff, I was absolutely, very upset. So I’m feeling better that he’s okay, and I am looking forward to seeing him.”

There are conflicting reports as to who politicized the nature of the attack on Smollett, claiming that the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country.” On Thursday morning the Chicago Tribune reported that the report came from Smollett himself, writing:

The pictures show two people walking down the street near where Smollett said two men approached him early Tuesday, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him and wrapped a rope around his neck. The images are dark and do not show any attack. Their faces are not clear at all. The pictures came from a surveillance camera on New Street near Illinois Street and were taken between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on Fox’s “Empire,” said he was attacked about 15 to 30 minutes later around the corner, in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street.

The Tribune added:

Smollett said he had just left a Subway when the men approached and yelled the slurs. Smollett is black and openly gay. Smollett told police he was hit and a chemical — maybe bleach — was poured on him. They put a rope around his neck and yelled, “This is MAGA country,’’ he told detectives.

The Chicago Sun Times also reported Thursday morning: “Smollett initially told police his attackers were two men wearing ski masks and all black clothing. In a follow-up interview in the morning, Smollett told detectives the men also yelled ‘this is MAGA country’ after they attacked him, according to Guglielmi. Smollett didn’t provide any other description of the men, including their race.”

However, in its initial report on Tuesday, TMZ reported that it was not Smollett himself, but rather “[s]ources directly connected” to Smollett, that reported the attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett has said two men approached him on Tuesday and hit him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, then placed a rope around his neck. The incident has drawn national attention.

TMZ reported Tuesday that the two suspects referenced Trump’s 2016 “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) campaign slogan during the alleged ambush, yelling, “This is MAGA country.”

""We can not confirm what the offenders stated,"" a Chicago Police Department spokesman said when asked about any MAGA-related language in the incident.

Chicago police have released surveillance footage of “potential persons of interest” in the incident but have not verified details of the alleged attack as described by Smollett."

Two days after Jussie Smollett was allegedly attacked in a possible hate crime, his family called the ""Empire"" actor ""a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.""

""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" the family wrote in the statement to ABC News. ""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""

The family thanked the thousands who have stepped forward on social media and beyond to share support for Smollett.

""We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive,"" the statement continued. ""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.""

The family added that ""radical love is the only solution"" to dealing the racism and homophobia they say led to the attack, but warned that ""passivity will be our downfall.""

""We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world,"" the family added.

The statement comes on the heels of new details provided by the Chicago Police Department Thursday morning. A dozen detectives are pursuing new leads and have tracked the actor's movements that night through video and photos, police told ABC News.

They say video shows Smollett walking across the street from two possible persons of interest, whose photos were released late Wednesday to the public. In the video, Smollett walks out of frame for about a minute and reappears on another camera ""wearing a rope like a neck tie,"" police said.

Police are still hoping to speak to the two men seen in the video about the alleged attack.

""Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member. While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,"" Chicago Police tweeted late yesterday.

Police also confirmed Thursday that a neighbor of Smollett's has come forward as a witness and said she saw a person carrying a rope of some kind around the time of the alleged attack. The physical description she provided was different than the one provided by Smollett and detectives have yet to find any surveillance video that shows an individual matching the description of the man she gave.

President Trump called the attack ""horrible"" while discussing a wide range of issues Thursday afternoon.

""Doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned,"" he said.

The ""Empire"" star told police the alleged attack happened Tuesday about 2 a.m. The 36-year-old actor was subsequently hospitalized and released, local authorities said.

Smollett has been cooperating with local authorities to find the men he says allegedly attacked him and shouted racial and homophobic slurs, police said.

Smollett has declined to hand over his cell phone to detectives, but police are not concerned by this due to the personal nature of someone's phone, police said.

Police also made it clear to ABC News that Smollett is not the target or focus of any criminal investigation; since he is the victim, they added, detectives won't press to obtain his phone.

Smollett told police that the men also allegedly poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, as shown in the new video. The rope was still around Smollett's neck when police spoke to him, officials said.

Brandon Z. Moore, Smollett's music manager, told ABC News he was on the phone with the actor when he heard part of the alleged attack. He also heard the words ""MAGA country,"" presumably from the alleged attackers, he added.

""I heard that clearly,"" he told ABC News. ""I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur.""

Police confirmed they have spoken to Moore and his account is noted in the police report. Moore and Smollett both said they were on the phone with each other at the time of the attack, police added.

Detectives have not yet seen phone records to confirm their accounts, police said.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday, ""Empire"" co-star Terrence Howard said a production manager notified the cast about the attack in a meeting on set Tuesday.

The actor said Fox boosted security on set in the wake of the incident and offered each cast member 24-hour personal security."

Now there are new details concerning the sickening incident, as a neighbor reportedly saw a suspicious man just outside of Jussie’s apartment building a little while before the attack. TMZ:

TMZ says “A woman who lives in Jussie Smollett‘s apartment building told cops she saw a suspicious man — whom she said looked like a ‘redneck’ — loitering just outside the entrance to the building an hour and a half before Jussie says he was attacked. The woman… walked out of the building at 12:30 AM Tuesday to take her dogs out and saw the man near the door, pacing between the parking garage and entrance, looking agitated and smoking a cigarette.”

Jussie’s neighbor tells the site that the man “looked out of place.” Additionally, TMZ reports, “He was a white man with scruff on his face wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood and blue jeans that were too short, exposing ‘thick, grey hunting socks’ with camel-colored dress shoes. She says she noticed what looked like a rope, or a clothesline, protruding from the bottom of his sweatshirt, made of white and blue material. She says he was staring at another man about 300 feet away, who was standing near another entrance to the building. She says she got ‘creeped out’ by the man, and after 5 minutes she retreated back into the building.”

The neighbor says she went to sleep and when she woke up, around 4 a.m., she noticed there was a lot of security, at which point the building’s concierge informed her Jussie had been attacked.

Cops have released photos of two persons of interest at this time. We will continue to keep you updated as new details surface."

Kevin Hart, who famously joked that he would break a dollhouse over his son’s head if he ever saw him playing with it, is not the first person you’d look to for words of comfort and bewilderment in the wake of Jussie Smollett’s attack. The comedian, who was ousted from hosting the Oscars over a series of old homophobic tweets, felt the need to weigh in on the hate crime against the Empire actor.

“Sending prayers your way,” Hart wrote on Instagram. “This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards....this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people....Choose love...I repeat...Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

The irony of this post led the rest of us to make that Scooby-Doo “huh?” sound — the language that Hart was initially called out for helps breed a culture of violence that targets queer people, so his confusion over how Smollett came to be attacked is...confusing. The girls were understandably not having it. Keep It host and Out contributor Ira Madison III responded to Hart’s “thoughts and prayers” tweet, calling it the comedian’s “funniest joke.”

your funniest joke congrats https://t.co/N3JqxaSJMl — Ira (@ira) January 30, 2019

Hart, refusing to take the extremely warranted criticism, replied to Madison, that he stands “with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support” and criticizing Madison for “harping” on his past “that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person. Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do...CHANGE!”

“I ‘harp’ because my community of black queer people face violence 365 in America,” Madison responded, “and when we tried to tell you that we weren’t trolling you but wanted to educate how your jokes lead to actions like what happened to Jussie, you went on Ellen to talk about your wheelchair movie.” Period.

- According to her, their relationship turned sour only because she got envious of the mother of three

- She revealed that it was because she thought Mercy Johnson was a better actress than her

It takes guts for anyone to admit wrong doing especially publicly. Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, seems to have eliminated all the ego in her based on her most recent post about Mercy Johnson.

Talking about how their friendship turned sour, the 33-year-old actress stated in a post shared on Instagram that she has always been envious of Mercy and thought she was a better actress than her. She revealed that it was what sparked her bad attitude towards Johnson in the past.

However, all that is over now as she has realised that being one's self instead of wanting to be someone else is the best way to live. Tonto's post is making waves online and many fans have shown admiration for her confidence and peace-making spirit.

Recall that the feud between the two top actresses started with Tonto Dikeh's angry outbursts on social media, in which she accused Johnson of being a neglectful mother.

It was back in 2013, after Mercy had her child and resumed acting when her daughter was only a few months old. Tonto claimed that Mercy abandoned her child when it needed her the most because of film-making.

Johnson of course did not receive the insults well and it escalated into a dramatic social media brouhaha that made them sworn enemies.

Following her most recent statement, it is now clear that Dikeh was only envious of the screen goddess returning to the limelight.

Luckily, they have patched things up and all that is now in the past now.

Meanwhile, recently, Dikeh took to weighing in on social media and the fake lifestyles it promotes. Tonto said that pictures were easily deceiving so Nigerians should beware of how easily they believe what they see.

According to the screen diva, no one should be distracted by the glamorous lifestyle of people rather they should stay focused on their own ambitions.

NEW YORK (AP) — For Grammy-nominated singer Joe, singing the hit song R. Kelly wrote and produced for him is out of the question.

“I’ve stopped performing the song,” he said in a statement to The Associated Press, referring to “More & More,” a Top 20 R&B song released in 2003.

“No music or intellectual property is worth being inconsiderate to the feelings or pain of others,” 45-year-old Joe continued.

In the wake of multiple sexual abuse allegations against R. Kelly — which intensified this month with the release of the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly” — some performers are denouncing songs the R&B hitmaker created for them.

Jennifer Hudson on Thursday removed two songs R. Kelly wrote for her from some streaming platforms, including YouTube and Apple Music: the Grammy-nominated “It’s Your World” and “Where You At,” a Top 10 R&B hit.

Lady Gaga apologized for her 2013 duet with R. Kelly, “Do What U Want,” and removed the track from streaming services. Celine Dion followed Gaga’s footsteps, removing her Grammy-nominated duet with the embattled singer, titled “I’m Your Angel,” from streaming platforms.

And B2K, the boy band whose only song to the top the Billboard Hot 100 chart was the R. Kelly-produced “Bump, Bump, Bump,” said after their reunion tour, which kicks off in March, they will no longer perform that song, or the others R. Kelly crafted for them.

“After the tour I am retiring those songs from my set list,” lead singer Omarion tweeted. “I too am raising a future queen.”

R. Kelly, who has denied all allegations of abuse against him, has written and produced his own hits like “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Bump N Grind.” He was once a white-hot hitmaker that most artists clamored to work with. R. Kelly was behind Michael Jackson’s “You Are Not Alone,” which became the first song ever to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 when it did in 1995. He also worked on multiple songs for Whitney Houston’s final album, 2009’s “I Look to You.”

He produced “Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number,” the 1994 debut album for Aaliyah, who was 15 when she married a 27-year-old R. Kelly the same year the album was released. The marriage was later annulled.

Aaliyah’s album included “Back & Forth,” a Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; other Top 10 hits R. Kelly crafted for others included “Stroke You Up” and “G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T.” for R&B duo Changing Faces; “808” for the girl group Blaque; and Maxwell’s “Fortunate,” the crowd favorite he performed at the last stop of his tour in New York in December.

But will he sing it again?

Several artists, through their representatives, didn’t return multiple email requests from the Associated Press asking if they would continue to perform songs R. Kelly wrote for them, including Maxwell.

A rep for Kelly Price, whom R. Kelly has worked with, declined to comment.

R&B singer Syleena Johnson told the AP after looking closely at the lyrics of her debut song, the R. Kelly-penned “I Am Your Woman,” she can no longer perform the track. She said she got goosebumps just thinking about how she sang lyrics like “Now I’ve been dealin’ with you since sweet 16/Woman enough to let you raise me/You used to call me daddy’s ghetto queen” for roughly 20 years.

Toni Braxton is currently on tour but it’s not clear if she’s performing “I Don’t Want To,” a hit song R. Kelly wrote for her multi-platinum sophomore 1996 album, “Secrets.” R. Kelly signed R&B singer Sparkle and produced her 1998 debut album, which included the hit “Be Careful” (Sparkle alleges Kelly sexually abused a young relative). And he even produced a mild hit for Britney Spears, 2004’s “Outrageous.”

R. Kelly also contributed to the careers of veteran acts like the Isley Brothers and Charlie Wilson, helping the seasoned performers find a home on contemporary radio alongside acts half their age (Wilson said last year he would not work with Kelly again).

Gospel singer Marvin Sapp’s “Listen” was written and produced by R. Kelly and peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot gospel songs chart last year. Though “Listen” was a success, Sapp has become a 11-time Grammy nominee thanks to his No. 1 hits like “Never Would Have Made It,” ”The Best In Me” and “My Testimony” as well as “Praise Him In Advance,” a No. 2 hit.

Sapp said in a statement to The Associated Press he is praying for R. Kelly.

“Based on my biblical studies, I have always been an advocate that the message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is bigger than the messenger. This is a guiding principal for me. When I was recording my most recent album, I was presented with the song ‘Listen,’ written and produced by R. Kelly,” he said.

He continued: “It struck me immediately as a song with a powerful message that needed to be heard, and as a song that I needed to record. With the recent airing of the ‘Surviving R. Kelly’ docuseries (which I have not seen), the world is chiming in and taking sides. My sentiment remains the same: I am not called to cast stones or pass judgment on anyone involved. My responsibility, and my heart, is to pray — for everyone involved,” he said.

He took pains to note that “praying for someone does not equal supporting them and it does not equal defending them.”

“My prayer is that R. Kelly and everyone involved are restored and redeemed — body, mind and spirit.”

R&B star Fantasia, whose 2016 song “Sleeping with the One I Love” came from R. Kelly, echoed some of Sapp’s thoughts.

“I am a mom and I’ve had the chance to work with him and you know, I got to see a lot of things. I did. So, the best thing my mother always told me is — you have to pray for people. You have to pray for them and that’s just what I’m doing now,” she said. “I’m praying for him and I hope that some things change because I am a mother and it breaks my heart.”

A warning: This piece contains descriptions of racial violence that some may find triggering.

People often perceive fame and recognition to be a form of privilege that insulates celebrities and other powerful people from injustice. But for certain stars — especially out, Black queer ones — that isn’t true. This week, Jussie Smollett was targeted for his identity as a Black queer man. He was also targeted precisely because of his fame and visibility.

Early Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked by two men wearing ski masks, who reportedly poured a chemical substance on him and put a rope around his neck. Smollett told Chicago police that he believed the chemical substance may have been bleach, Forbes reported, and that the assailants had yelled “MAGA Country,” referring to one of President Donald Trump’s campaign slogans.

Given events that have happened in the past couple of years, people have begun to associate “Make America Great Again” with acts of racism. Some writers and activists, such as including Alyssa Milano, have even posited that MAGA hats are just as much a symbol of racism as the white hoods of the Klu Klux Klan.

Police have said they are investigating Smollett's brutal attack as a possible hate crime. According to data from the FBI, since Trump’s election, the number of hate crimes in America has risen, increasing by 17 percent in 2017. As CNN reported, while there are many different motivations for hate crimes, often attackers are not only focused on hurting an individual, but also want to instill fear in an entire group of people that share the individual’s identity.

By reportedly using homophobic and anti-Black slurs, Smollett’s attackers likely meant to send a threatening message to the Black and gay communities. His celebrity and visibility ensured that the attack — which Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker described as a “modern-day lynching” — would capture the country's horrified attention.

For LGBTQ individuals and people of color, America has always been at least partially defined by how it has legalized and normalized attacks on identity. Consider the government-sponsored racial terror of the Jim Crow era, the lethal apathy of Ronald Reagan’s administration during the HIV/AIDS crisis, and Trump's ban on transgender people in the military.

When you’re part of a marginalized group, visibility is dangerous, no matter what privileges you’ve attained.

Partly because of the widespread normalization of racism and the role that our government systems play in perpetuating it, most hate crimes go unreported. Black trans women experience horrifying levels of violence that the media often fails to report as an urgent crisis. Black women are unlikely to report sexual violence against them. All this indicates that people who are attacked for the intersection of their race, gender, and sexuality often fear either that they won’t be believed, or that police interactions will re-traumatize them.

American society has normalized and ignored the violence that happens to “regular people,"" so there are still some individuals who are surprised that people with record deals, acting credits, or even a blue check mark by their Twitter username could experience such violent hate. But it’s not a rarity. In 2016, Saturday Night Live cast member Leslie Jones’ website was hacked; the attackers posted her driver’s license and stolen nude photographs of her. Some called this “harassment,” but others pointed to it as a hate crime against a successful Black woman whose starring role in a Ghostbusters reboot had attracted criticism. Kelly Marie Tran, the first woman of color to have a leading role in a Star Wars film, faced a lot of backlash online last summer and said she started to internalize the hateful things people were saying about her. It was Jones' and Tran's identities, as well as their celebrity, that made them vulnerable.

In the Fox drama Empire, Smollett plays Jamal, a gay character who struggles with homophobia among his family and in the wider Black community. It was a groundbreaking role that explored the intersections of race and sexuality, and Smollett, like his character, has used his voice and platform to shed light on injustice. But as Smollett broke down those barriers, he became more of a target himself.

Being visible is dangerous when you’re part of a marginalized group, no matter what privileges you’ve secured. What happened to Smollett is a prime example of why it’s so important for everyone to use an intersectional lens when we talk about oppression and identity-based violence — especially in the age of Trump, when it feels like so many of us are being attacked for simply existing.

Celebrity won't protect marginalized people from hate, and often, visibility is dangerous. Our eyes need to be wide open to the fact that hate crimes are a reality for people of color and LGBTQ folks, and especially for people who identify both as people of color and LGBTQ. When a black queer celebrity is attacked in a ""possible hate crime,"" that's not a shocking anomaly: It's a powerful reminder of just how vulnerable marginalized groups are.

Jenni (JWoww) Farley has posted videos that seemingly shows her estranged husband Roger Mathews throwing her to the ground.

The Jersey Shore star also posted a lengthy letter to Mathews on her website, which details the alleged abuse she and her family have had to experience with Mathews.

In the first clip Farley posted on Wednesday, a man, who appears to be Mathews, can be seen shoving a woman, who appears to be Farley, to the ground in the kitchen at their home.

In the videos taken by Mathews, he admits to having an affair with another woman, whose husband allegedly beat him up. He goes on to claim it was worth the fight because the woman was “smoking hot.”

She claimed that Mathews had planned to blackmail her with a two-year-old video of herself throwing a vacuum and other items in his direction, while he was holding their then-six-month-old son Greyson, who can be heard crying. She posted this video to her website.

“Your intimidation tactics with footage that you intend to show out of context are meaningless,” Farley wrote.

She also posted screenshots of a text message conversation between a nanny and herself in regard to Mathews.

“I have spent the last few months trying to protect our children from public humiliation, because as parents, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THEM,” Farley began.

“I wanted to handle this out of the spotlight because our silence is their greater good. Even when you tried to disgrace my name, make false accusations and even point-blank lie… I still remained silent as challenging as it was… why? Because, greater good,” she continued.

“I can no longer sit idly by while you mistreat and malign me in such an egregious manner,” the mother-of-two wrote. “You have presented yourself to the public as a praiseworthy father and a husband who has been suffering by my alleged actions and behaviour.”

Farley alleges that it was herself and their children, Meilani Mathews, 4, and Grayson Mathews, 2, who were “hurt” by Mathews’ actions.

“You are an abuser to the core, Roger Mathews. If this was not enough, you have spit at me, You have pushed me. You have shoved me. You have aggressively thrown me to the ground. You have prevented me from closing doors to escape having you come at me. You have belittled and disparaged me. You have threatened me,” Farley wrote.

She continued: “You have called authorities to falsely accuse me of harming our children hoping to get a leg up as leverage in a custody case, only resulting in our children having to be undressed and physically examined, being humiliated and investigated with naturally no substantiation of any abuse on my part. You claim to have suffered? Your actions are reprehensible. No real man would torture his family as you have. You are cruel and vicious.”

Farley also claims that Mathews’ social media “postings are consumed with inaccuracies, false statements, self-serving comments, outright misrepresentations and blatant lies.”

“Your actions have and continue to place the children in harm’s way. Stop, pause and have a true reality check,” Farley wrote to Mathews.

The 32-year-old reality TV star alleged that Mathews attempted to contact her former ex to get him to “intimidate” her. She wrote that Mathews knew there was a restraining order placed for her protection against her previous ex-boyfriend.

She said that Mathews teamed up with her ex, Thomas Lippolis, to extort money from her.

Lippolis was arrested in December and charged with third-degree extortion, the Tom’s River Police Department in New Jersey confirmed in a press release.

According to the press release, Farley claimed Lippolis attempted to extort US$25,000 from her “in exchange for not divulging secrets to the media.”

“It is unfathomable to me that because of you proactively contacting an ex-boyfriend of mine to team up against me, he was arrested for trying to extort money from me,” Farley alleged in her statement on Thursday.

“You didn’t stop there though. You persisted to try to take me down. You knew that another ex from my college years brutally beat me so badly that I was hospitalized.”

She attached a copy of a 2008 protection order against the ex whose name was blacked out.

“He was incarcerated for the violent acts against me,” Farley continued.

“When your own acts of domestic violence against me were questioned, you chose to reach out to this unspeakable person in order to intimidate me,” Farley alleged.

“Your attempt to bring this heinous person back into my life (the mother of your children) after he nearly murdered me speak volumes as to who you really are,” Farley wrote. “You are an abuser to the core, Roger Mathews.”

Farley also accused Mathews of contacting her bosses to “attempt to smear my name and hurt my public image.”

She filed a restraining order against Mathews in December after the pair had got into an argument.

On Dec. 14, Mathews posted 3 videos while he was in the back of a police car. He said he called the police himself and after they left, he went out to record a podcast with a friend and then returned home.

After he went to sleep, he alleged he was woken up by police at 2 a.m. and taken from his house after they told him Farley had contacted a judge and filed a restraining order against him.

Farley said she’s done her best to put on a brave face for their children.

“I clearly thought of us co-parenting well into the future as responsible parents should,” Farley wrote.

“So many of you may be understandably afraid to come forward, and have been stuck in abusive relationships for far too long just as I have been. If anyone is feeling down, broken, hurt or lost, please know that it is not your fault!” she wrote.

Comedian Kevin Hart issued a statement of support Wednesday for Jussie Smollett after the Empire actor was the target of a possible hate crime.

But when that message sparked a predictable backlash — based on homophobic jokes Hart made in the past — the straight actor started pushing back on critics himself.

Hart posted an Instagram post a day after Smollett was allegedly stopped in Chicago and beaten by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs. Chicago police released surveillance pictures of suspects on Wednesday.

Hart initially wrote: “Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ....This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards....this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people....Choose love...I repeat...Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

He posted a similar comment on Twitter.

But the sentiments quickly prompted others to raise Hart’s past with antigay tweets, an issue that recently led the comedian to pull out of hosting the Academy Awards.

Gay writer Ira Madison responded on Twitter: “This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny.” He called Hart's message of support to Smollett ""the funniest joke.""

Madison's marks referenced the jokes Hart previously made on social media about assaulting his young son for playing with dolls, comments that drew particular critique from queer people of color.

But Hart quickly turned to the narrative he’s tried to set since the Oscars scandal, that he’s long apologized and reformed his views.

He wrote on Twitter: “I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person. Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do...CHANGE!”

Chinese New Year begins with typical colour and vibrancy on 5 February. 2019 is the year of the pig. To quote Danny Dyer: “Trotters up”.

After New Year’s Eve celebrations on the 4th, spring festival events and rituals run for around 15 days and then on 19 February, the lantern festival takes place, and the sky glows.

Chinese New Year is about driving away evil spirits, honouring friends, family, ancestors and gods, and relaxing and having fun.

In modern China, the country has a week’s public holiday so people are free to observe tradition. In the UK, it’s not typical to get time off, but there are number of parties to look forward to.

Here are a few picks from across the UK, from martial arts displays to the most delicate, soft dim sum.

London

London’s Chinatown isn’t the only place to go in the capital, but it’s the most obvious and famous for a reason. London is home to the UK’s largest Chinese population and Chinatown is a historic focal point.

On 10 February, there’s a Chinese New Year parade, which feature floats, dragons, and dancing. Elsewhere, there are craft stalls, music, and restaurants serving regional dishes, whether hot Schizuan noodles, classic Peking duck, or Cantonese dumplings. Chinatown gets seriously busy, but it’s a brilliant experience.

Birmingham

Festivities are held in the Chinese quarter of Birmingham and is one of the city’s largest public celebrations, attracting some 30,000 people every year.

Much like Chinatown in London, the emphasis is on dancing, street entertainment, and feasting. Birmingham has some of the country’s best Chinese street food. It would be rude not to indulge.

Liverpool

In the Liverpool ONE shopping centre, the city’s Chinatown, and on Bold Street and surrounds, thousands of red lanterns will be hung from rooftops and balconies. Elsewhere, buildings such as the Bombed Out Church, Everyman and Playhouse Theatres, and Sefton Park House will be turning red in commemoration.

Liverpool’s major event will be the Chinese arch, which was a gift from Shanghai 20 years ago. At 13.5 metres high, it’s the largest outside mainland China, and there’ll be plenty of action around it.

Manchester

Manchester’s events take place over the weekend of 7-10 February 2019. In the town centre, you’ll find a giant art installation piglet, a glittering golden dragon, and live performances, all culminating in a parade.

Like all Chinese New Year parties, there’ll be a lion dance, as well as a street food market featuring the likes of Dim Sum SU, Jade Rabbit, Wallace & Sons, and Kowloon Café.

Newcastle

In Newcastle, 10 February is the big day. Chinese New Year festivities will be put on by the North East Chinese Association and will be based around the city’s Chinatown along Stowell Street, where there’ll be live performances, crafts, dance, music, and refreshments.

On Bath Lane, there’ll be a traditional Chinese market and fairground.

Edinburgh

Edinburgh officially hosted Chinese New Year conviviality for the first time in 2018. This year, there’ll be various activities and food to enjoy.

The main event, however, is a concert at Usher Hall on 9 February. The Edinburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Edinburgh Singers, and a number of other artists and soloists from China and the UK are set to perform.

Bristol

Bristol Museum and Art Gallery is staging traditional and contemporary performances, stalls, workshops, and activities over 3-4 February.

There’ll be the best of Chinese culture on show across the museum, and a traditional menu available in the cafe. Think dance, song, kung fu displays and calligraphy exhibitions.

Cardiff

In Cardiff, there’s a Chinese New Year party on 4 February at Liberty Fields, with brush painting, music, a spring gala, food, drink, and various other moments of frivolity.

The day-long event is, a little oddly, organised by a student accommodation group, but it looks to be the only real Chinese New Year event, and apparently the food and drink is free…"

Kevin Hart can’t seem to catch a break.

Yesterday, the 39-year-old comedian, who’s history of antigay jokes and tweets recently came back to haunt him, responded to the racist and homophobic attack against Jussie Smollett in an Instagram post, calling the incident “unbelievably sad” and decrying society going “backwards.”

This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.

The remarks were also posted to Hart’s Twitter page, where they were quickly met with sharp criticism.

Do you see why the “jokes” weren’t funny now?? — Bethany West (@niale_west) January 30, 2019

You should have just sat there and ate your food, Kevin. Ain’t nobody trying to watch you use this for an op. — Dimitrius Jones (@iDimitriusJones) January 30, 2019

Hart wasted no time hitting back. In response to the criticism, he tweeted:

I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person. Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do…CHANGE! https://t.co/Ybbo8OYKTt — Kevin Hart (@KevinHart4real) January 30, 2019

Unfortunately, just like his initial tweet, this one also didn’t go over well either…

I “harp” because my community of black queer people face violence 365 in America and when we tried to tell you that we weren’t trolling you but wanted to educate how your jokes lead to actions like what happened to Jussie, you went on Ellen to talk about your wheelchair movie. https://t.co/bGXkNVQsTl — Ira (@ira) January 31, 2019

It has become quite clear that self-reflection is not Kevin Hart’s strong suit. The man is incapable of understanding why his words and actions are problematic and he’s never going to give people the proper apology they want. At some point, folks are simply going to have to move on. In the meantime, Mr. Hart might consider taking a nice, long vacation, somewhere warm and tropical, without WiFi or access to social media.

Kevin Hart is trying to change over here!

The comedian, fresh off his anti-gay joke controversy, is hitting back at the criticism he received for sending Jussie Smollett support after the Empire star was brutally attacked in a possible hate crime this week.

As we reported, the Night School star joined the choir of celebs on Twitter and wrote that the alleged attack was “disgusting” and he feared society was “going backwards.” But given his history with homophobia-laced humor and maybe not fully apologizing for it, Hart’s heartfelt message was met with some snark.

Among the many critics was TV writer Ira Madison III, who replied to Hart’s tweet quipping that it was his “funniest joke yet.”

But Hart wasn’t here for more hate. He defended his tweet and accused his critics of being counter-productive, responding to Madison:

I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person. Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do…CHANGE! https://t.co/Ybbo8OYKTt — Kevin Hart (@KevinHart4real) January 30, 2019

Clearly, he feels attacked.

Since stepping down from hosting the Oscars last month, Hart apologized multiple times for his recently resurfaced homophobic tweets. But some in the LGBT community feel he hasn’t apologized *enough*, and Hart is quite frustrated they haven’t moved on yet.

Madison, to his credit, admitted he was being petty in a follow-up tweet:

It’s not fun being the butt of the joke, is it Kev?

Kevin and his response were slammed by some people on social media considering his anti-gay jokes in the past and his handling the Academy Awards fiasco, where he stepped down after refusing to apologize. (He never apologized previously. Contrary to incorrect reports, his first apology was when he stepped down).

DeGeneres also tweeted, “Four years ago, @ JussieSmollett came out on my show. I’m sending him and his family so much love today.”

The talk show host was also hit hard for what some perceived to be weak handling of Hart when he appeared on her show to explain the Academy Awards drama. Even Roxane Gay, a famous New York Times bestselling author who also co-wrote the “Black Panther: World of Wakanda” comic book series, tweeted at her, “As much love as you sent Kevin Hart?”

Hart, 39, might need to take a break from social media.

While walking to a Subway in Chicago, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the 36-year-old actor after he exited the restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Threatening letters directed at Smollett were reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago last week. The cutout letters said, “You will die black f**.” See below:

The suspects shouted racial and homophobic slurs during the attack, police said. No arrests have been made.

On Wednesday, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi posted two CCTV images to Twitter, showing a pair of figures wearing black.

Mr Guglielmi said they are “people of interest” who were in area of the alleged assault.

He added: “While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.”

Smollett has starred in Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terence Howard.

His Empire co-star Taraji P Henson is among the celebrities to have offered their support on social media.

As well as his acting, Smollett is also a singer and activist who has advocated HIV/Aids prevention.

At the time, Smollett was attacked by a group of men, who beat him, put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him while shouting things like, “this is MAGA country.”

The woman claims that she walked out of the building at 12:30 AM on Tuesday with her dogs when she noticed the man near the door. He was pacing between the parking garage and the entrance. She said he looked “agitated” and “out of place” as he smoked a cigarette. She described him as a white man with facial hair, a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up hooded sweatshirt and blue jeans that were too short, as well as “thick, grey hunting socks” and camel-colored dress shoes. She also claims to have seen a rope or clothesline hanging out of the bottom of his sweatshirt, made of a white and blue material. He was staring at another man who was about 300 feet away, near another entrance of the building.

The woman claims she was “creeped out” by the man and went back inside five minutes after she came out. She went to sleep and woke up at 4 AM to go to the gym, when she noticed a lot of security. The concierge told her Smollett was attacked and when she told him what she saw, he gave her two phone numbers for detectives. She then told police the information that afternoon. Police have released photos of two persons of interest, but it’s unknown if one of them is the person that this woman saw.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi also said police have recovered video that shows the 36-year-old actor walking into his apartment, but that he hasn’t seen it and doesn’t know if Smollett appeared to be in any distress when he arrived home.

He said that Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that Smollett declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Meanwhile, police are hoping to identify and talk to the two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose images police released to the public late Wednesday. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have information that could be useful to the investigation.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the 36-year-old actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

Guglielmi said Wednesday that detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from that section of the Streeterville neighborhood. But he said they still needed to collect and view more in the hopes of finding footage of the attack or of the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned. Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

In an update to the situation, a woman who lives in Smollett’s apartment building has told police she saw a suspicious man whom she described a “redneck” loitering just outside the entrance to the building an hour and a half before the “Empire” star says he was attacked.

The woman who spoke to celebrity gossip site, TMZ on the condition of anonymity revealed she walked out of the building at 12:30 AM on Tuesday to take her dogs out and saw the man near the door, pacing between the parking garage and entrance, looking agitated and smoking a cigarette.

She says,

“He looked out of place. He was a white man with scruff on his face wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood and blue jeans that were too short, exposing “thick, grey hunting socks” with camel-colored dress shoes.”

She further stated that she noticed what looked like a rope, or a clothesline, protruding from the bottom of his sweatshirt, made of white and blue material.

Not only that she said he was staring at another man about 300 feet away who was standing near another entrance to the building. According to her, she got “creeped out” by the man, and after five minutes she retreated back into the building.

She further went on to sleep and woke up at four AM to go to the gym, and noticed a lot of security. She says the concierge told her Smollett was attacked, and when she told him what she saw, the concierge implored her to call a detective and gave her two phone numbers. She made contact that afternoon and downloaded a detective.

It would be recalled that that some reports have it that police have released photos of two persons of interest."

Chicago police have released an update on the investigation into the attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett, releasing photos of two potential persons of interest in the case.

Police and the FBI are still investigating the attack, which took place in the early hours of Tuesday (January 29) in Chicago.

Out TV star Smollett, who plays a high-profile gay character on Fox show Empire, was hospitalised after the violent incident, in which he was reportedly branded a “faggot Empire n****r” and had a noose tied around his neck by two men.

Jussie Smollett attack: CCTV shows two figures near location of attack

There have been no arrests following the incident, but police have now released CCTV stills of two figures who are potential persons of interest in the case.

The footage shows two men dressed in black walking together along a street with their faces obscured from view.

Chicago Police communications officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted a Jussie Smollett attack update on Wednesday (January 30), issuing an appeal for help finding the “potential persons of interest wanted for questioning in reference to the assault.”

He added: “Detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.”

The police department later issued a community alert that states: “On January 29, 2019, in the 300 block of East Lower North Water St., at approximately 2:00 a.m., the victim returned to his residence when he reported that he was attacked by two male subject(s) who struck the victim several times and knocked him to ground.

“During the course of the incident, the victim stated that the subject(s) placed a rope around his neck and poured an unknown liquid substance on him.

“The subject(s) fled the area where the attack occurred.

“Detectives are seeking to identify and interview the two subject(s) depicted in the pictures above, walking on New St. near Illinois, between 1:30 a.m. to 1:45 a.m. in order to determine whether they may have any involvement in the reported incident, or if they may have witnessed the incident.”

In a previous statement, Chicago PD said: “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.

“The victim is fully cooperating with investigators and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com.”

The FBI has confirmed it is assisting the investigation.

ThatGrapeJuice, the first outlet to report the attack, alleged that a threatening letter was sent to Smollett days before the attack that reads: “You will die black fag.”

The envelope featured the acronym ‘MAGA,’ which stands for the pro-Trump slogan “Make America Great Again.”"

The Chicago PD and the FBI are jointly working the case, in which Smollett was reportedly attacked by two ski-mask-wearing men (who placed a noose around his neck) yelling homophobic and racial slurs. As such, this is being probed as a hate crime, and although law enforcement has so far been unable to unearth surveillance footage of the attack itself, police have now released a blurry photo (from footage captured nearby the scene) of two persons of interest in the case.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Chicago Tribune that the image was captured around the corner from where (and about 15-30 minutes before) Smollett was attacked outside a Subway restaurant near his apartment. “They are outside on a street walking,” stated Guglielmi. “They are in the area that we have determined it could have taken place … in the time and the area. It certainly leads us to have questions for them.’”

The Chicago PD is asking anyone with information about the attack to call 312-717-8382 or report tips anonymously at cpdtip.com.

The assault on Smollett, an openly gay actor who plays a gay character on Empire, took place at around 2:00am on Tuesday. Police reportedly confirmed that a noose remained around Smollett’s neck when they responded to his apartment, and they confirmed smelling bleach on his clothing. Variety has followed up on a disputed detail about the attack and now reveals that the police report includes mention from both Smollett and his manager, Brandon Z. Moore (who was on the phone with his client during the scuffle), that they heard the attackers yell, “MAGA country!”

Meanwhile, Empire production has grown complicated due to not only the Smollett situation but the polar vortex. E! reports that FOX suspended filming on Wednesday because of the arctic temperatures (subzero with wind chills in the negative double digits) currently gripping Chicago. During a weather-related press conference on Wednesday, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel briefly discussed the attack on Smollett. “Obviously the alleged statement of what happened here is horrific,” Emanuel stated. “And there’s no place for it in the city of Chicago.”

Richard Shotwell/Invision / AP

CHICAGO — Jussie Smollett's family said Thursday that the alleged attack on the black and gay ""Empire"" actor in downtown Chicago this week was a ""hate crime"" and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn't spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett's family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

The area is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants and has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home, Guglielmi said. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In the very early hours Tuesday morning, Smollett was reportedly approached by two white men wearing ski masks who shouted, “Aren’t you that f*ggot ‘Empire’ n*gger?” They men then pounced on him, broke his rib, slid a noose around his neck, doused him in bleach, and screamed “This is MAGA country!” then fled the scene.

Smollett was taken to a local hospital, where he was treated for his injuries and released a few hours later. Meanwhile, the two alleged assailants remain at large.

Now, Chicago police released two surveillance photos of two figures they are calling “persons of interest” in the attack.

In a tweet late yesterday, Anthony Guglielmi, spokesperson for Chicago PD, wrote:

Meanwhile, TMZ spoke with a woman who lives in Smollett’s apartment building who claims she saw a suspicious man milling around just an hour and a half before the attack.

TMZ reports:

The woman — who asked us not to use her name — tells TMZ, she walked out of the building at 12:30 AM Tuesday to take her dogs out and saw the man near the door, pacing between the parking garage and entrance, looking agitated and smoking a cigarette. She says, “He looked out of place.”

The Chicago Police Department is searching for two persons of interest spotted in surveillance footage taken in the area where Empire star Jussie Smollett was violently assaulted.

Smollett reportedly visited a Subway sandwich shop early Tuesday morning when he was beaten by men shouting racist and homophobic slurs at him, Chicago Police said. The actor recalled that the men yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

The images, which were released to the public Wednesday, were found after the department extended the parameters of the area that they were reviewing for information. A spokesperson for the department tweeted a statement about the progress in the investigation.

“Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member. While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,” he wrote.

Smollett was on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, as the assailants approached him. Moore confirmed the use of racist and homophobic language during the attack. He told Variety, “I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur.”

The Chicago Police Department is requesting community assistance in gathering additional information.

“We continue to seek any available evidence/video to identify possible offenders in this case. Anyone who may [have] been in area of 300 East North Water Street [between] 1-3 a.m. should send info to cpdtip.com,” the department wrote."

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there are hundreds of surveillance cameras in the area, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants, and that the hope is that detectives will be able to piece them together to capture most if not all of Smollett’s trip from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at about 2 a.m. Tuesday, when Smollett said the attack occurred.

Guglielmi said piecing together the private and public surveillance video is tedious work that is made more difficult by the fact that the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi also said police have recovered video that shows the 36-year-old actor walking into his apartment, but that he hasn’t seen it and doesn’t know if Smollett appeared to be in any distress when he arrived home.

He said that Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that Smollett declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Meanwhile, police are hoping to identify and talk to the two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose images police released to the public late Wednesday. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have information that could be useful to the investigation.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the 36-year-old actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

Guglielmi said Wednesday that detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from that section of the Streeterville neighborhood. But he said they still needed to collect and view more in the hopes of finding footage of the attack or of the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned. Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Smollett claimed that he was assaulted by two men at 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 in Chicago.

“Photos of people of interest who were in [the] area of the alleged assault and battery of ‘Empire’ cast member,” said Anthony Guglielmi, Chicago Police Department spokesman, in a caption accompanying the pictures while sharing them on Twitter.

“While video [footage] does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously and wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,” he added.

In a community alert, police said that two male subjects were reported by Smollett to have struck him and knocked him to the ground before placing a rope around his neck and pouring an unknown substance on him.

“Detectives are seeking to identify and interview the two subjects depicted in the pictures, walking on New Street near Illinois, between 1:30 a.m. to 1:45 a.m., in order to determine whether they may have any involvement in the reported incident or if they may have witnessed the incident.”

Smollett initially told police officers that he was assaulted by two men wearing ski masks concealing their faces who shouted slurs at him before beating him and pouring an unknown chemical substance on him.

“At one point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck,” police said in a statement sent to Reason.

In a later interview, Smollett claimed that his attackers shouted “this is MAGA country,” referring to the phrase “Make America Great Again.”

“In the initial reports there was no mention of MAGA” but “when detectives follow[ed] up with him later in the day, he recalled the offender making those comments and detectives completed a supplemental report,” police stated.

Smollet’s music manager Brandon Moore told police officers that he was on the phone with Smollett during the alleged attack and that he overheard some of the incident including one of the assailants saying “MAGA country” in addition to the racial slur, ABC 7 reporter Rob Elgas reported.

However, detectives aren’t able to verify the call because both Smollett and Moore refused to let officers check their phones.

Police told Elgas that detectives used time codes from two different cameras to piece together the movements of Smollett and the two “people of interest.”

Let me clarify. On one camera the “persons of interest” are seated at a bench. ACROSS the same street, Smollett is seen walking. Smollett is recorded on that different camera walking. The “persons of interest” are also seen walking, but on the other side of the same street. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

“On one camera the ‘persons of interest’ are seated at a bench. ACROSS the same street, Smollett is seen walking. Smollett is recorded on that different camera walking. The ‘persons of interest’ are also seen walking but on the other side of the same street,” Elgas said.

“The next time Smollett is seen on surveillance camera, he is entering a condo building.

And what appears to be road salt is on his sweatshirt.”

Smollett then went to the home of an acquaintance, where police arrived to take his report.

While taking his statement, Smollett requested the responding officers to turn off their body cameras, which police said isn’t uncommon when officers enter a private residence.

Smollett later transported himself to Northwestern Hospital and was treated."

Robert Jennings received lethal injection for the July 1988 fatal shooting of Officer Elston Howard during a robbery at an adult bookstore that authorities said was part of a crime spree.

As witnesses filed into the death chamber, Jennings asked a chaplain standing next to him if he knew the name of the slain officer. The chaplain didn’t appear to respond, and a prison official then told the warden to proceed with the punishment.

“To my friends and family, it was a nice journey,” Jennings said in his final statement. “To the family of the police officer, I hope y’all find peace. Be well and be safe and try to enjoy life’s moments, because we never get those back.”

Outside the prison, more than 100 officers stood vigil. And a motorcycle club that supports police revved their engines, with the roar from the bikes audible in the chamber.

Jennings was pronounced dead at 6:33 p.m., 18 minutes after the drug started. He became the first inmate put to death this year both in the U.S. and in Texas, the nation’s busiest capital punishment state.

“Justice has been rendered and my family can finally have the closure we deserve,” Michael Agee, Howard’s nephew and a current Houston officer, said after watching Jennings die. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, asked about the 30-plus years between the crime and the punishment, said he thought “justice delayed is, to an extent, an injustice continued.”

“But when the state takes a life, there has to be a process,” Acevedo said. “In this case, the day of reckoning is here. It’s a solemn occasion. For us it’s a celebration of a life well-lived by Officer Howard. We’re a family. That’s why we’re here.”

His attorneys had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to delay his execution, arguing Jennings’ trial attorneys failed to ask jurors to fully consider evidence — including details of his remorse for the officer’s shooting and possible brain damage — that might have spared him a death sentence.

Jennings had received an execution stay in 2016. But the high court and lower appeals courts rejected his request to delay Wednesday’s execution and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles turned down Jennings’ request to commute his sentence.

A twice convicted robber, Jennings had been on parole for about two months when prosecutors say he entered Mr. Peeper’s Bookstore with the intention of robbing the business. Since being paroled, Jennings had gone on a crime spree, committing about 10 robberies, including having already robbed the same adult bookstore 12 days before Howard’s slaying.

Officer Howard, 24, was in the middle of arresting the store clerk for operating a pornographic video arcade without a permit when Jennings shot the officer twice in the head.

Howard, who had been wearing a jacket with the words “Houston Police” on it, staggered for a few feet before falling to the ground, where he was shot twice more by Jennings. The clerk later testified the shooting was so quick, Howard never had a chance to unholster his gun.

Jennings was arrested hours later when he went to a Houston hospital after being shot in the hand by his accomplice, who got angry at Jennings for shooting the officer.

Joe Gamaldi, the president of the Houston Police Officers’ Union, said Jennings has spent more time on death row than Howard was alive.

Howard “was an honorable man full of integrity who did his job. He was absolutely one of the best and he was just taken entirely too soon by this animal who murdered him in cold blood,” Gamaldi said.

After his arrest, Jennings confessed to killing Howard, telling police in a tape-recorded statement he was remorseful about what happened and would “face whatever punishment (he had) coming.”

Edward Mallett, one of Jennings’ current appellate attorneys, said the inmate’s trial attorneys failed to present sufficient evidence of his remorse as well as his history of brain damage, being abused as a child and drug addiction. He said the trial attorneys also failed to provide an instruction to jurors that would have allowed them to give sufficient weight to these aspects of Jennings’ life when they deliberated.

Mallett said a prior appellate attorney also failed to argue these issues in earlier appeals.

“There has not been an adequate presentation of his circumstances including mental illness and mental limitations,” Mallett said.

Jennings’ trial in 1989 took place just as the Supreme Court issued a ruling that faulted Texas’ capital sentencing statute for not allowing jurors to consider evidence supporting a sentence less than death.

The Texas Legislature changed the statute to address the high court’s concerns but that took place after Jennings was convicted.

The Texas Attorney General’s Office called Jennings’ claim he had ineffective lawyers at his trial and during earlier appeals “specious,” and said appeals courts have previously rejected allegations his personal history was not adequately investigated and presented at his trial.

“My hope is that on Wednesday (Howard’s family gets) the closure that they’ve been searching for 30 years,” Gamaldi said.

Chicago is experiencing a record-breaking cold snap that rivals Arctic temperatures. Those vulnerable to the icy weather like the homeless, were seen camped out in a tent city after their propane tanks to keep them warm were taken, reports The Chicago Tribune.

A Salvation Army spokeswoman Jacqueline Rachev told the Tribune that one of the propane tanks the group was using exploded. The Chicago Fire Department then confiscated all the other propane tanks because they posed a hazard.

“We responded to a fire,’’ department Chief Walter Schroeder said. “When we got there, the fire was extinguished and they found all these propane cylinders. That’s when we escalated it to a Level I Hazmat.’’

“There was a significant amount of propane there, and with that many cylinders, that’s like a bomb going off,’’ he added.

As Rachev prepared to move the homeless population to a makeshift warming center at the downtown Chicago Salvation Army, she was informed that a charitable donor was picking up the tab to place the homeless group in hotel rooms.

“All the folks there, some wonderful citizen is going to put all of them up at a hotel for the rest of the week,” she said.

One person, however, did opt to stay at the warming center, the paper reported.

Prisoners shovel snow in the cold

A shocking photo has surfaced of inmates at Chicago’s Cook County Jail shoveling snow is frigid weather without any coats or warm gear to keep them from getting frost bite, The Daily Mail reports.

La Villita, Chicago, a community advocacy organization, shared the alarming photo on Facebook as prisoners shoveled snow in their orange jumpsuits.

“They have the prisoners cleaning snow with little protection from the cold.”

The photo soon went viral and was re-shared by the Chicago Community Bond Fund showing men shoveling “without proper winter weather attire.”

To add insult to injury, the men reportedly were only “paid $2 for their labor as part of the Sheriff’s RENEW program,” the fund said.

“We commented on their working conditions & the absurd idea that this was workforce training,” the fund tweeted.

The RENEW program reportedly “aims to reduce neighborhood blight in distressed suburbs while also providing vocational training to a targeted group of inmates.”

“We hope the Sheriff’s Office will provide the public with information about what is going on here and how these folks are being treated,” the fund tweeted.

According to The Chicago Tribune, Cara Smith, chief spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office, said that “the situation was entirely and intentionally misrepresented.”

According to Smollett, he was assaulted by two men after he left a local Subway restaurant in Chicago. The men wore ski masks and according to Smollett said, “Aren’t you that f—t ‘Empire’ n—–?” and yelled “This is MAGA country” and began beating him while continuing their vile tirade. The assailants then poured bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck before leaving the scene. But now some on social media are doubting his story as police have come up short on video evidence of the assault.

One of the first famous people to possibly throw shade was singer Erykah Badu.

But other social media users have been perplexed at how the attackers recognized Smollett. One Facebook user wrote, “Wait they yelled, Aren’t you that f—t ‘Empire’ n—–. Are Trump racists really watching ‘Empire’ and know the background of characters?”

Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi released a statement that reads in part: “As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find a video to be able to release a public description of the offenders. Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect’s vehicle to be able to share.”

Because of the lack of video footage, some are doubting Smollett’s word, who would have no reason to injure himself and make up a story that could end his career. Still, because of the racist nature of the attack, some are calling the incident “fake news.”

Chicago – Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking in downtown Chicago before and after he says he was attacked by two masked men, including video of him arriving home with a rope around his neck, but they’re still searching for footage of the attack, a police spokesman said Thursday.

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett’s apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven’t found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett’s walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Meanwhile, police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose images police released to the public late Wednesday. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have information that could be useful to the investigation.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn’t far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Smollett told police he was was approached early Tuesday by two masked men who shouted “racial and homophobic slurs” before punching him in the face, pouring an unknown chemical on him and wrapping a rope around his neck. The actor, who is gay, reportedly told investigators his attackers cited President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan during the assault.

The reported crime prompted an outpouring of support from Smollett’s “Empire” co-stars, as well as other celebrities like John Legend, Margaret Cho and Billy Eichner. Hart sympathized late Tuesday on Twitter and Instagram, urging Smollett to “stand strong brother.”

Almost immediately, the comedian’s remarks sparked a backlash on social media. Many called attention to Hart’s controversial use of anti-gay jokes in both his comedy sketches and on Twitter.

Dear @KevinHart4real .

It's truly sweet you feel for @JussieSmollett and the incident he has endured. However this is the reason why your ""jokes"" were such a problem. And why apologies were asked for or will constantly ask for. Because it's still a very troubling world. https://t.co/JYFBOWdaWc — Jiggly Caliente (@JigglyCaliente) January 30, 2019

Many of Hart’s LGBTQ-referencing jokes and tweets dated back to 2010 and 2011, before he was an established name in Hollywood. They resurfaced in the media in December, after the comedian was announced as the host of the 91st Academy Awards, set to take place on Feb. 24.

Hart initially refused to apologize for his statements, claiming he’d previously done so in interviews (though evidence of that is scant). Days after his Oscars gig was announced, he stepped down as the host and apologized.

On Wednesday, Hart shot back at those who criticized his support of Smollett, pointing to himself as “an example” of the type of “change” LGBTQ advocates were encouraging.

I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person.

I choose love...I love all of you. I challenge the rest of the world 2 do the same. — Kevin Hart (@KevinHart4real) January 30, 2019

Chicago police haven’t publicly identified any suspects in Smollett’s attack, but released images of “potential persons of interest” late Wednesday.

Smollett, meanwhile, has left Chicago’s Northwestern Memorial Hospital after being treated for cuts to his face and neck. He’s set to return to the concert stage Saturday for a previously scheduled performance in Los Angeles.

The actor’s representative, Pamela Sharp, has said he is “recovering well.”"

On Wednesday, the comedian took to Twitter to address those on social media who criticized his message of support for the actor earlier that day, many claiming that his past homophobic statements contributed to the violence inflicted on Smollett.

“I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heartfelt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person,” Hart wrote. “Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do… CHANGE!”

Just hours earlier, Hart had shared a message of support and called for action.

“Sending prayers your way [Jussie Smollett] ….This is unbelievably sad,” he shared on both Twitter and Instagram. “Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. [What the f—] is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

The message was a point of contention for many, who pointed to Smollett’s attack as an example as to why Hart’s past homophobic comments were damaging to the LGBTQ community. The comedian, who stepped down as host of the Oscars following backlash to his past jokes and statements, had stated in a joke in 2011 that he would physically harm his son if he came out as gay. Just like his initial message, the comedian’s response to the backlash was met with criticism.

“I 'harp' because my community of black queer people face violence 365 in America and when we tried to tell you that we weren’t trolling you but wanted to educate how your jokes lead to actions like what happened to Jussie, you went on Ellen to talk about your wheelchair movie,” Crooked Media host Ira Madison III wrote in response.

“This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny,” Madison III continued in a second tweet.

“The fact that Kevin Hart continued to claim this was simply a coordinated smear campaign (“a malicious attack”) by trolls illustrates that he’s not sincerely apologetic for his words, only sorry that he was forced to be held accountable for them,” another person commented.

For his part, Smollett has yet to comment on the attack, which left him with lacerations to his face and neck. The Chicago Police Department, who are investigating the incident “as a possible hate crime,” have identified potential persons of interest."

Chicago police have requested Empire actor Jussie Smollett’s phone records in order to substantiate his manager’s claim that they were speaking on the phone when Smollett was viciously attacked early Tuesday morning, but Smollett has reportedly refused to turn them over.

Smollett claims he was leaving a Subway sandwich shop around 2 a.m. Tuesday when two assailants began beating him, placed a noose around his neck, and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him — all while shouting racist and homophobic slurs. After initially sharing just those details with the police following the attack, Smollett later told the authorities that the assailants shouted “this is MAGA country” before fleeing, after that claim appeared in a TMZ account of the incident.

Smollett’s manager, Brandon Moore, who was with his client at a Chicago apartment when the police arrived, claims he was speaking with Smollett on the phone during the attack and overheard many of the racist and homophobic comments Smollett recounted.

“I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,” Moore told Variety when asked if he heard the alleged “MAGA country” comment.

But Smollett and Moore now refuse to turn the records of their calls over to the police.

After reviewing hundreds of hours of private surveillance footage captured by area businesses, the police announced Tuesday night that they have been unable to find any footage of the alleged attack. They have, however, identified a “person of interest.”

The attack, which is being treated as a “possible hate crime” by the authorities, has drawn the condemnation of a number of high-profile Democrats, who have cited the incident as an example of a broader trend of rising political violence.

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching.

Just kidding! We've known that for a very long time!

But still, even though we've known for a good long while now that Kevin is awful, he keeps on managing to find ways to get even more awful.

It's actually kind of impressive.

See, Kevin has, in the past, made many, many homophobic remarks.

In 2010, he said in one of his comedy specials that ""One of my biggest fears is my son growing up and being gay. That's a fear.""

""Keep in mind, I'm not homophobic,"" he insisted. ""Be happy. Do what you want to do. But me, as a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will.""

We're pretty sure that ""not homophobic"" version of that would be something like ""as a heterosexual male, I'll still love and accept my son no matter what his sexuality may be,"" but sure, Kevin, totally not homophobic.

In 2011, he tweeted ""Yo if my son comes home & try's 2 play with my daughters doll house I'm going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice 'stop that's gay'.""

We gather that these are supposed to be jokes.

Pretty wild, huh?

Around the same time, he made tons of questionable tweets, like the one where he told Damien Wayans that he looked ""like a gay billboard for AIDS.""

He used the word ""gay"" as an insult several times, he thought it was cute to use the phrase ""no homo,"" and he wasn't afraid to call people f-gs.

Then, in 2015, he starred in the movie Get Hard, which was filled to the brim with gay jokes, many of which centered around prison rape.

When asked about it in an interview, he defended the distasteful jokes by simply saying that ""funny is funny.""

Lots of people have known about all of this for a long time, but it became a very big deal last month when it was announced that Kevin would be hosting the Oscars.

People weren't happy with the news, and Kevin couldn't care less.

He said that he wouldn't apologize for what he said because he'd already apologized publicly, even though no one could find any such thing.

He said that his critics were just looking for reasons to be negative, and when the Academy called him up and asked him to just go ahead and make that apology, he refused.

He felt so strongly about not apologizing that he stepped down from the hosting job.

Ridiculous, right?

It gets worse!

So earlier this week, Jussie Smollett, an actor best known for his role on Empire, was attacked in Chicago.

Two men beat him so hard that they fractured his ribs, and they put a rope around his neck and poured what's believed to be bleach on him.

They also called him ""f----t,"" -""n----r,"" and told him ""This is MAGA country.""

So ... that's a hate crime.

But what does this have to do with Kevin?

Like many celebrities, he tweeted about the attack, writing ""Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett .... This is unbelievably sad.""

""Why are we going backwards .... this is disgusting,"" he continued. ""We as a people have to do better. WTF is going on in the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate????""

""God damn it people .... Choose love...I repeat...Choose love.""

He finished his message with ""I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.""

You can probably see why that didn't get the best reaction.

As many people pointed out, Jussie was attacked because of the same kind of thinking that Kevin ""joked"" about -- like, Kevin joked about beating his own son if he told him he was gay.

TV writer Ira Madison said as much on Twitter, and when Kevin made his big statement on Jussie, he tweeted ""your funniest joke congrats.

And Kevin had had it.

""I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person,"" he replied.

""Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do...CHANGE.""

The issues with this are the same issues we've been talking about -- it wasn't just ten years ago when he said these things, and he's never made a really sincere public apology that anyone can find.

It's difficult to understand why, if he is truly sorry about the things he's said, he won't just make one great big apology along the lines of ""Sorry I was horrible, I don't hold those same views anymore.""

If some people still couldn't get past his offensive comments, that would be their choice, but at least then he could stop all of this ""IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO LEAVE ME ALONE"" nonsense.

Ira Madison really said it perfectly in his response to Kevin:

""I 'harp' because my community of black queer people face violence 365 in America and when we tried to tell you that we weren't trolling you but wanted to educate how your jokes lead to actions like what happened to Jussie, you went on Ellen to talk about your wheelchair movie.""

Just do better, Kevin.

It is honestly not as hard as you're making it out to be."

The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett's apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven't found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor ""is at home and recovering.""

Meanwhile, police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose images police released to the public late Wednesday. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have information that could be useful to the investigation.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

U.S. President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

On Wednesday, the Chicago Police Department released screenshots of two persons of interest in the alleged attack on Smollett. The Empire star told police he was returning from a fast food restaurant at around 2 a.m. when two men began hurling racial and homophobic slurs (Smollett is gay and black).

During the alleged attack, Smollett says a rope was put around his neck, bleach was poured on him, and one of his attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

After poring through hundreds of hours of surveillance video, police found footage of two people who were in the vicinity of the attack around the time it allegedly occurred.

Rob Elgas, the reporter covering the story, tweeted out additional information about the persons of interest Wednesday night, including the fact that they are only seen across the street from Smollett. However, both disappear from the surveillance video for about 60 seconds. Here is the relevant part of the reporter’s tweet thread:

Detectives used time code from two different cameras to piece together Smollett’s movements when he was near [the persons of interest]. On one camera the [persons of interest] are seated at a bench. The other camera shows Smollett across the street. Police say both Smollett and the “persons of interest” walk out of frame (on different cameras). Smollett would reappear on a different camera about a minute later. So basically for about 60 seconds Smollett is not on surveillance camera. Let me clarify. On one camera the “persons of interest” are seated at a bench. ACROSS the same street, Smollett is seen walking. Smollett is recorded on that different camera walking. The “persons of interest” are also seen walking, but on the other side of the same street. The next time Smollett is seen on surveillance camera, he is entering a condo building. Police say he now has a rope around his neck and is “wearing it like a neck tie”. About a minute (maybe less) has passed since he was seen on video. Smollett, according to investigators, walks in to the building, walks by building security and gets on an elevator. This video is better quality according to detectives. And what appears to be road salt is on his sweatshirt.

Unknown so far is whether the persons of interest disappeared from the camera at the same time Smollett did. We also don’t know if the persons of interest are seen again, and if they are, are they walking or running away? What time did they arrive to sit on the bench? What time did they leave the bench? Were they walking in the same direction as Smollett?

Two men sitting on a bench at 2 a.m. in the freezing cold in downtown Chicago does raise questions about why they were there.

On the questions of the timing of the video, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that the police will only say that the video of the persons of interest was taken at “about the same time [Smollett] was in the area.”

“They could have been the perpetrators, they could have been witnesses, they could have been complete bystanders who didn’t see the incident at all,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the paper. “There are still a lot more cameras that we have to look at. It’s almost like a digital puzzle. You have to put all of those pieces together and kind of watch them at the same time.”

As police continue to investigate Tuesday morning's alleged homophobic, racist attack on Empire's Jussie Smollett, two of the actor/singer's co-stars have reached out with love and support. His Empire dad, Terrence Howard, told Good Morning America on Wednesday (Jan. 30) that when the news hit the set of the long-running Fox musical drama, ""jaws dropped to the ground...and then we learned that there had been letters that had been set to Fox as threats about the potential of something like this, then we became much more frightened.""

According to reports, prior to the attack, police said that a letter with anti-gay epithets and white powder were mailed to the studios where Empire is filmed on Jan. 22. It was reportedly addressed to one of the show's actors, triggering a hazardous materials call to fire officials who determined the powder was not hazardous; the FBI has taken over the probe into the letter. TMZ reported on Wednesday that Smollett had turned down an offer of extra security in the wake of the letter, as security was beefed up for all the cast members last week on the Chicago set of the show.

Howard told GMA that Smollett is on the mend and though he's angry with the as-yet-unnamed and still at-large alleged assailants, he will forgive them. ""Jussie's anger will dissipate, and he will forgive these people for what they did,"" Howard said. ""But he won't, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance."" Howard, whose character has slowly come to accept his on-screen gay son's sexuality -- Smollett came out in 2015, just after his character Jamal Lyon did the same on the show -- had nothing but the highest praise for his co-star.

""Jussie's the one that starts singing when everybody's in a bad mood,"" Howard said. ""He's the one that cheers everybody up. He's the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping...today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family -- you know, the Fox family, the Empire family, the Lyon family -- you know, were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.""

Smollett was taken to a hospital on Tuesday morning in Chicago after police said two men approached him yelling homophobic and racist slurs and then allegedly assaulted him and poured an unidentified chemical on his body. Smollett was briefly hospitalized and has spoken to police about the incident -- during which he reportedly had a noose wrapped around his neck by the assailants -- but has not made a public comment to date.

On Wednesday night's Tonight Show, SNL's Kenan Thompson sent out his thoughts to his former Mighty Ducks co-star, telling host Jimmy Fallon, ""We should send some love to Jussie Smollett...we're sending a lot of love to the Smollett family. Send a lot of love to the universe because this kind of madness needs to stop."""

As the Inquisitr shared, the actor took to his Instagram page to send well-wishes to Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who was hospitalized after a physical, homophobic, and racist attack in Chicago. Since news of Smollett’s attack surfaced, many celebrities and fans sent well-wishes to the actor, including Hart.

“Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett….This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better,” Hart wrote along with a photo of Smollett. “Why are we falling in love with hate?…Choose love…I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

The next day, he also stated that he was going to start “operation love” before saying that he doesn’t understand the point of hate. But since his comments on Smollett’s situation, he has received a lot of backlash from fans just as he did during his Oscar fiasco. As fans know, Hart was forced to step down from his Oscar hosting gig after receiving backlash after homophobic tweets from his past resurfaced. He has apologized and moved on from that, saying that he wasn’t going to discuss it further in interviews, but now it seems like he is back to square one.

Once again, people on social media gave Hart a hard time for being a “hypocrite” and many were quick to slam him for his post. But once the comedian caught wind of the haters, he stepped up and defended himself.

“I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person,” the 39-year-old tweeted. “Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do…CHANGE!”

The comment that most got under Kevin’s skin was reportedly one from TV writer Ira Madison who commented on Hart’s post about Smollett with a smug response.

“Your funniest joke congrats,” Madison wrote.

Madison also followed up that comment with another tweet, which inferred that Hart is a hypocrite.

“This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny.”

According to the Huffington Post, the Chicago Police Department has released images of the two masked men who they believed attacked Smollett when he was walking back to his Chicago apartment in the Streeterville neighborhood. During the attack, Smollett was reportedly subjected to racist and homophobic insults, and the masked men threw an unknown chemical substance at him. Additionally, the men put a rope around his neck before they fled the scene.

Chicago police are asking for the public’s help in identifying the two masked men so they can bring them in for questioning."

And interestingly, Kevin Hart was among the number. He shared this picture of Jussie with these words.

Afterward, we shared that there were more than a few people who noted that Hart missed yet another opportunity to connect the dots between his language—from ten years ago—and the actions that transpired against Smollett.

While Hart has offered an apology, he’s spent even more time talking about the “haters,” people who don’t operate in love and light. He’s assured us he’s changed but went on a media tour talking about how he resented having to do so repeatedly.

It’s an accountability issue.

And when folks pointed that out after Hart’s condolences, he took time out to point to the change he’s undergone.

Change is evidenced through behavior, not the insistence that you’ve changed because you offered a reluctant apology, in the midst of attempting to shame the people who called you out in the first place. Change is apologizing without looking to make other people a scapegoat in the midst of your own shortcomings.

We’ll stay on the lookout for it.

Police released images showing two figures, both wearing what appear to be dark jackets, walking along a snowy street between 1.30am and 1.45am local time on Tuesday, nearby where Smollett, 35, alleged he was attacked less than an hour later.

Smollett reported that he was assaulted by two people carrying a noose and an unidentified ""chemical substance"" in what police are calling a ""possible racially charged assault and battery.""

""While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday (Jan 30).

Smollett was walking in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street about 2am local time on Tuesday ""when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a statement to The Washington Post.

""The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.""

Police could not confirm the gender of the offenders or identify the chemical substance.

""At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victims neck,"" the statement said.

Eventually the offenders fled, and Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Hospital ""and is in good condition.""

TMZ reported that Smollett was discharged on Tuesday morning. The hospital could not confirm this detail but told The Post that Smollett was not currently a patient.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" police said.

Smollett told detectives his attackers said ""something to the effect of 'this is MAGA country',"" an apparent reference to President Trump's enduring ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan, during the assault.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the initial police report did not reference those comments, but the actor recalled the information in a follow-up interview with detectives.

Guglielmi said Smollett still had a thin, white rope around his neck when officers first made contact with him around 2.40am, roughly 40 minutes after the alleged assault. He also confirmed that the FBI is investigating a threatening letter that was sent to Smollett on Jan 22 at the Fox studio in Chicago.

The FBI has not yet responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post.

Fox released a statement on Tuesday in support of the actor.

'VICIOUS' ATTACK

""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate - and especially against one of our own.""

Smollett's publicist did not immediately respond to The Post's request for comment.

Smollett began his career as a child actor with his siblings, who include actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. He is best known for playing Jamal Lyon on Empire. The character is a gay R&B musician who has faced homophobic criticism from his mogul father.

The character struggled with his sexuality before coming out in a buzzed-about Season 1 episode. The plot development led to widespread speculation about Smollett's sexuality.

A month later, Smollett appeared on the TV show Ellen, when he confirmed he is gay.

""It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet, there's never been a closet that I've been in,"" he told TV host Ellen DeGeneres. ""I don't have a closet. But I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home. So that's why I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is, without a doubt, no closet I've ever been in. And I just wanted to make that clear.""

He more directly addressed his sexuality in a 2016 interview with Out magazine. Though Smollett said he was open to falling in love with anyone, he identifies as a gay man.

""I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I don't know how many times I have to say that,"" he told the magazine.

As news of his attack spread Tuesday, Smollett received statements of support from LGBTQ advocacy organisations he has worked with over the years.

""Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,"" GLAAD said in a statement.

""This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign.

""There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities - and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities.""

Last year, the FBI said there was a 17 per cent increase in hate crimes in 2017 - the third consecutive year such crimes increased. Of the 7,175 hate crimes reported by United States law enforcement agencies, 2,013 incidents targeted black Americans. 1,130 hate crimes involved people who were targeted based on their sexual orientation.

Messages of support from fans and fellow celebrities for Smollett poured out on Twitter as the news unfolded.

Terrence Howard, the star of Empire, appeared on Good Morning America on Wednesday morning, where he said Smollett was improving, though it was difficult.

""I heard he's getting better. You know, he's angry,"" Howard said. ""But I know Jussie. Jussie's anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won't, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.""

Howard also praised Smollett, saying, ""Jussie's the one that starts singing when everybody's in a bad mood. He's the one that cheers everybody up.""

Empire co-star Vivica A. Fox tweeted in all caps: ""IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!! SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE! PRAYERS UP TO U NEPHEW!""

Lee Daniels, who co-created Empire with Danny Strong, posted a heartfelt and expletive-laden video on Instagram.

""It's taken me a minute to come to social media about this, because Jussie, you are my son,"" Daniels said. ""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck... You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are. Because it shows we are united on a united front.""

Strong, meanwhile, wrote that he is ""deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks.""

Smollett ""is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,"" Strong tweeted.

""Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.""

Grey's Anatomy actress Caterina Scorsone sent ""love and healing"" to the actor: ""We must tirelessly teach our children about the dignity and sacredness of each and every human being so that this kind of insanity ends. Hate destroys us from within. Teach them to love. It's on us.""

Democratic Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker both weighed in on Twitter, calling the assault a ""modern-day lynching"".

""No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin,"" tweeted Harris.

""We must confront this hate."""

Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department, noted on Twitter that ""detectives located a surveillance camera that shows potential persons of interest wanted for questioning in reference to the assault & battery of"" Smollett. He added that ""while video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.""

What's the background?

Numerous media outlets ran with a Tuesday TMZ report saying the actor was beaten up after walking out of a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. by two white men wearing ski masks who asked, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before pouring bleach on him, putting a noose around his neck, and yelling, ""This is MAGA country!""

Chicago Police told TheBlaze on Wednesday morning there was ""no mention of MAGA"" in initial reports. But when detectives followed up with Smollett later on Tuesday, he recalled the offenders making those comments, and detectives completed a supplemental report.

Rob Elgas of WLS-TV in Chicago tweeted that after investigators heard the ""MAGA country"" claim in the news they called Smollett again, after which he added that information.

Smollett's music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, told ABC News he was on the phone with Smollett during the attack and that he heard ""MAGA country"" spoken: ""I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur.""

Chicago Police told the network they spoke with Moore and that his account is in the police report — but they haven't yet confirmed it with phone records. Police added to ABC News that Smollett and Moore told them they were on the phone together.

Police didn't specify the race of the alleged suspects but did call it a ""possible racially-charged assault and battery"" and that they are ""treating it as a possible hate crime.""

A threatening letter and drawing to Smollett was sent to the Fox television studio in Chicago on Jan. 22, police told ABC News, and it contained a powdery substance that investigators believe was likely crushed-up Tylenol.

Smollett reportedly was wearing rope 'like a necktie'



Police told ABC News that Smollett was seen on camera walking into an apartment with a rope around his neck and ""wearing it like a necktie"" before calling cops from inside the building.

CBS News said ""when police got to his apartment, they said a noose was still around Smollett's neck.""

Elgas reported that ""when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed.""

Other curious details:

According to another tweet from Elgas, ""Smollett requested responding Chicago police officers turn off their body cameras as they arrived to take his report. A spokesman says this is not uncommon when officers enter a private residence.""

Elgas added that Chicago police have a security image of Smollett alone inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime, and that cops also obtained additional video placing him at the scene of the crime.

But sources told CBS News they've seen security video of Smollett outdoors early Tuesday morning and ""nothing of an assault.""

And the weather in Chicago at midnight Tuesday — two hours before the alleged attack — showed a low temperature of 1 degree with 14-mph winds.

Guglielmi told The Associated Press that detectives have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area and are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the individuals who match Smollett's description.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" Guglielmi added to the AP, referring to a container for the liquid Smollett said was thrown at him.

The AP added that Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses, and in train tunnels — and that police said such cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests."

Henson, who portrays Jussie Smollett's mother on the hit show ""Empire"" is breaking her silence about Smollett's brutal attack in Chicago that took place on early Tuesday.

The actress, best-known for her role as Cookie on the Emmy-nominated show, took to social media to show her support for her co-star who is currently recovering from a suspected hate crime. The actor was beaten by two men who screamed “MAGA country,"" racial and homophobic slurs while “pouring an unknown chemical substance” on him -- also putting a rope around his neck.

In Henson's post, she shared an emotional video of Smollett singing his protest anthem called ""F.U.W.""

The caption read:

""I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn't and we all feel his pain right now. @jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!!

The love so many have him just goes to show HE IS LOVE!!!! I LOVE YOU MY BABY MY BABY!!! #LOVEWINSALWAYS.""

Just last week, anonymous threatening homophobic letters were addressed to Smollett and sent to the Fox studios.

The FBI is actively working on the actor's case and Chicago police recently released photos of people of interest via footage from a surveillance camera.

CHICAGO -- Jussie Smollett's family said Thursday that the attack on the black and gay ""Empire"" actor in downtown Chicago this week was a ""hate crime"" and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn't spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett's family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

The area is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants and has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home, Guglielmi said. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said. “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

They said such incidents will continue to happen until people are held accountable.

The “Hot Topics” hostess of The Wendy Williams Show has been missing in action for weeks from center stage on her show because of reported issues with Graves disease and because she had to nurse a fractured shoulder.

Now, the wear and tear of travel is on the chopping block, and an insider told Us Weekly that Williams is planning to move from her New Jersey digs to Manhattan so she can be closer to work, sans the travel through the hectic commuter traffic. Also, her popular show is filmed in NYC.

“There’s been talk of her moving for her health and life to improve,” the source said.

“Staff are planning a big ‘welcome back’ show where Wendy will address her health problems,” the source told In Touch.

Bit for now, Williams is said to be focused on getting better.

“She’s fighting to get back to a clean bill of health,” an insider told the outlet.

So for now, a rotation of celebrities have been filling in at the helm of The Wendy Williams Show.

Comedian and TV host Nick Cannon will be taking over the hot seat as the temporary new host of the show next week as the popular host continues to recover from a shoulder fracture and health setback.

Cannon will start serving as the temporary host on Feb. 4, Feb. 5 and Feb. 6, Page Six reports.

It was announced earlier this month by Williams’ representatives that she needed to take a brief hiatus to mend.

“As Wendy Williams Hunter previously shared, she fractured her shoulder and has been on the mend.

The photos, apparently captured from overhead surveillance cameras, reveal no discernible details about the persons of interest — only two figures walking side by side.

“While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously and wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,” wrote Chicago Police Department’s Director of Communications Anthony Guglielmi on Twitter.

Smollett, a cast member of the TV show “Empire,” said he was in Chicago getting something to eat at around 2 a.m. Tuesday when two masked men physically attacked him, hurled racial and homophobic slurs, and shouted “MAGA Country.” He told police that they punched his face and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him, and that one of the men put a noose around his neck.



At a press conference Wednesday, Guglielmi said that Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment after the alleged attack, and his manager called police about 40 minutes later. Police said that when they got there, Smollett had scrapes on his face and a “thin rope” hanging around his neck. He later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital at the recommendation of law enforcement. Authorities said he's in “good condition.” He’s going ahead as planned with a scheduled solo concert in Los Angeles on Saturday.

Guglielmi also said Wednesday that detectives had canvassed and reviewed “hundreds of hours of video” in the neighborhood where Smollett says the attack occurred, noting that that particular area has a “very high density of city and private surveillance cameras,” but had found no helpful information on a suspect or a suspect’s vehicle.

But Guglielmi also stressed that the investigation was ongoing at that point, and that they were working on collecting and viewing more surveillance footage from the areas surrounding the crime scene. Police said earlier this week they were treating the case as a possible hate crime.

Because of the brutal nature of the allegations and Smollett’s public profile, the case has garnered significant attention and prompted outpourings of support from celebrities and lawmakers alike, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris and Sen. Cory Booker.

TOP TALKER — Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) discussed her views on Israel and BDS during an interview with Zainab Salbi: “When I see Israel institute a law that recognizes it as a Jewish state and does not recognize the other religions that are living in it, and we still uphold it as a democracy in the Middle East, I almost chuckle, because I know that if we see that in any other society we would criticize it, we would call it out.”

Omar went on to say that an “equal approach” is the only way America will succeed in achieving a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. “Most of the things that have always been aggravating to me is that we have had a policy that makes one superior to the other — and we mask it with the conversation that’s about justice and a two-state solution when you have policies that clearly prioritize one over the other,” she said.

Salbi: Some of your supporters, not all, talk about your support of the BDS movement — Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions on Israel.

Omar: “I’ve not only supported and called for [a] boycott of Israel, but I’ve done that with Saudi Arabia. I’ve actually called for a boycott to Hajj in Saudi Arabia.” [JewishInsider; Video]

Dr. Einat Wilf‏ tweeted in response to Rep. Omar: “This goes to the core refusal to recognize the Jews as a people. The insistence by many that Jewish is a religious adjective is designed to deny the Jewish people the universal right to self determination enjoyed by other peoples in their nation states.”

Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY): “Those poor innocent ISIS fighters & Palestinian terrorists right? Give me a break! That’s a problem no matter your religion or gender Ilhan. Your anti-Semitic and anti-Israel hate is strong and wrong and those terrorists have US blood on their hands as well.”

— Omar shot back at Zeldin, replying to a supporter: “Don’t mind him, he is just waking up to the reality of having Muslim women as colleagues who know how to stand up to bullies! It’s gonna be fun watching him lose his marbles.”

Top Democrat on foreign affairs shoots down pro-Palestinian trips — by Bryant Harris: “House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) told Al-Monitor this week that he would not approve Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s proposed West Bank delegation. “Instead of her talking about things, she’s new here, she ought to listen and learn and open her mind and then come to some conclusions,” Engel told Al-Monitor. “If you’re going to be close-minded and have your views, no one’s going to change her views. But I would hope that once you’re elected to Congress, you would at least care to see the other side of the coin.” [Al-Monitor]

— However, an aide to Engel told JI on Wednesday that Tlaib “doesn’t need the approval of the HFA committee” for a CODEL since she’s not a member of the panel.

Tlaib responded to Engel on Twitter: “Yo Rep. Eliot Engel, how are we ever going to obtain peace? I hope you’ll come with me on the trip to listen and learn. My sity (grandmother) will welcome you with an embrace and love. Please feel free to call me if you have anything to say. I am your colleague now.”

Washington Institute’s Dennis Ross emails: “There is nothing wrong with a trip to the West Bank, provided it is to Israel as well. The conflict is not a morality play where one side is all right and the other is all wrong. Seeing and hearing from both sides is legitimate. Otherwise, the purpose is about promoting one side’s narrative. If the aim is scoring debating points, you go to one-side. If the aim is problem-solving and promoting understanding, you go to both.”

John Podhoretz writes… “The Left would be wise to worry about its anti-Semitic wing: The ‘very small problem’ [Mark] Mellman has in mind is a trio of newly elected Democrats: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar. They seem to have very few foreign policy views aside from a caricature of Israel as an occupying colonial force that sits up at night thinking of new ways to torment Palestinians. Such ideas haven’t arisen from nowhere. They are the full flowering of decades of leftist propaganda and fashionable campus blatherskite. From such repellent acorns mighty trees grow, as we have seen in Europe. Britain’s Labour party did little to head off the virulent Israel hatred in its ranks, and it is now headed by an out-and-out anti-Semite.” [NYPost]

— Aaron David Miller emails: “That mainstream Democrats in Congress feel the need to counter emerging progressive voices on Israel in Congress and country at large speaks volumes on the fracturing of the consensus on U.S.-Israeli ties. There now seems to be three views of Israel – aRepublican view; a mainstream Democratic and a progressive view. It’s not yet time to say kaddish for the U.S.-Israeli relationship – not by a long shot.”

Bret Stephens writes… “The Persistence of Anti-Semitism: Anti-Semites tend to have the opposite set of views, for reasons that may be repugnant but are perfectly rational. The fundamental truth about anti-Semitism isn’t that it’s necessarily crazy. It’s that it’s inevitably brutish. The conclusion to be drawn is that the enemies of the Jews, whether in Tehran or Virginia, will always be the enemies of liberalism — which is why the fight against anti-Semitism must also be a fight for liberalism.” [NYTimes]

ON THE HILL — Bipartisan coalition holds the center on foreign policy — by Josh Rogin: “Internationalist Democrats and Republicans are increasingly finding common cause, not only in promoting robust U.S. foreign policy positions but also in asserting the legislative branch’s role in national security decision-making and oversight… It’s easy to get a headline by… using an anti-Semitic trope to criticize Israel legislation, but real action on foreign policy in Congress is not found on the far left or the far right — it’s in the center.” [WashPost]

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) tweeted on Wednesday: “The 1st Amendment arguments made by ACLU and some Senate Democrats to oppose my Anti-BDS bill are baseless. The 1A applies to speech, not conduct. My Bill clearly applies only to commercial ‘activity’ by a business entity. And it does not apply to speech or personal views of individuals.”

— ACLU responded: “With all due respect, Marco Rubio — it seems like you don’t understand your own bill, or the First Amendment. That’s troubling, but we’re here to help.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told JI: “I strongly oppose the BDS movement and I believe that states, like my home state of New York, should be able to pass legislation to combat it.”

Trump blasts U.S. intelligence officials, disputes assessments on Iran and other global threats — by John Wagner and Shane Harris: “President Trump lashed out at U.S. intelligence officials Wednesday, calling them ‘extremely passive and naive’ about the ‘dangers of Iran’ … during a congressional hearing… ‘They are testing rockets (last week) and more, and are coming very close to the edge,’ Trump wrote on Twitter. ‘Their economy is now crashing, which is the only thing holding them back. Be careful of Iran.'”[WashPost] • Iran Faces Worst Economic Challenge in 40 Years, President Says [NYTimes]

TALK OF THE REGION — Vice President Mike Pence is expected to be the keynote speaker at the Ministerial to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East, co-hosted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Polish government in Warsaw, Poland on February 13-14. “The Vice President will address the United States’ commitment to work with partners to help build a strong, secure, and economically viable Middle East,” the White House said in a statement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed his attendance at the summit on Tuesday.

REPORT — The Venezuelan opposition is expected to appoint an Ambassador to Israel, possibly even ‘in the next coming days,’ after PM Netanyahu recognized Juan Guaido as the interim president of Venezuela, Israel’s Kann News reported on Wednesday.

FOGGY BOTTOM — Never Trumpers’ Can Get State Department Jobs With Pompeo There — by Nick Wadhams and Jennifer Jacobs: “Recent months have seen Secretary of State Pompeo hire at least three previously vocal Trump critics for senior advisory roles… That list includes Elliott Abrams, who Pompeo picked last week as his special envoy to deal with the political crisis in Venezuela. Abrams’s opposition to Trump when he was running for president led the administration to block his candidacy as then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s deputy two years ago. But bygones are bygones… Abrams, like Trump, appears to have moved on. ‘I can tell you that I was over at the White House yesterday,’ Abrams said Wednesday. ‘We are all on what we call Team Venezuela, which is an effort to help the Venezuelans liberate their country from this regime.’” [Bloomberg]

That’s helped him forge close relationships with numerous Trumpworld officials and family members like Donald Trump Jr. The two are now so close they spent last year’s Super Bowl together.

CHICAGO (AP) — Jussie Smollett’s family said Thursday that the attack on the black and gay “Empire” actor in downtown Chicago this week was a “hate crime” and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn’t spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett’s family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked “racial and homophobic hate crime” and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

They thanked the public “for their prayers” and said the family is “so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.”

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said. “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

They said such incidents will continue to happen until people are held accountable.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama “Empire” is shot in Chicago and follows an African-American family navigating the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Smollett has told police that he was walking home from a Subway restaurant when the attack occurred. Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of his walk home, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett’s manager called police about 40 minutes after Smollett got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven’t seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett’s description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels. Smollett was walking in an area that has high-end hotels and restaurants. It also has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett’s walk home, Guglielmi said.

It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

It was February 2017 when I first heard about Chyna Gibson, a beloved stage performer who had been gunned down in her hometown of New Orleans. My stomach dropped, as it does every time I hear about another Black transgender woman being attacked or murdered. Over the next few weeks, I ravenously consumed every article I could find that humanized her (and there weren’t many). I learned that she was only a few years older than me and that she had performed at The Jungle, the first gay club that I had ever gone to in Atlanta. I read that she eventually moved to Northern California, just like I had nearly a year before, and that she had a mother that loved her. In her story — and its end — I saw myself.

The despondency I felt when Gibson was murdered was similar to what I felt when news broke that Empire star Jussie Smollett had been assaulted early Tuesday morning. Though I was used to the Black LGBTQ+ community raising up these heinous acts, this time I witnessed the general public offering up their concern and desire for accountability and progress. It was encouraging to see deep discussion on how white supremacy especially threatens Black queer people. (Though I did notice a number of people and media outlets diminishing the fact that the incident was also steeped in homophobia.) But throughout the day, I was also reminded of all of the times that many of the same folks who were speaking out for Smollett had been silent when scores of our Black transgender sisters were attacked or murdered.

As long as I’ve been an activist and community organizer, I’ve witnessed the disparity of concern that is placed on some people’s brushes with violence over others. When a cisgender Black person, typically a heterosexual man, is attacked or murdered, I can depend on the larger Black community to commiserate. I’ll see signs held with their names at marches, viral hashtags, mentions by public figures, and a demand for change to make conditions better for them. With Smollett, the privilege of celebrity also pulls stronger on the heartstrings of the community. If he weren’t a wealthy, famous, and attractive man, it’s highly doubtful that he would have become a trending topic.

When Black trans women are brutalized, I have mostly come to expect silence from nearly every group that we’re part of. After we are diminished and marginalized in our lives, should we then be murdered, we can expect careless investigators and police officers releasing inaccurate names and genders and an endless justification for our deaths, suggesting we were ‘tricking’ our assailants or that we made bad life choices that placed us in a precarious situation. The hierarchy of whose lives actually matter is clear.

There was no outpouring of social media posts when Dana Martin, a 31-year-old Black transgender woman was murdered earlier this month. As more reports come out about Candice Elease Pinky, a Black trans woman who was chased with a gun and shot in broad daylight in Houston last week, I’m curious to see if, with this widespread concern for Black LGBTQ+ victims, her experience will be elevated as well. And what about the next inevitable attack on a Black trans woman? Will we continue to be erased and ignored from the various communities and movements that we’re apart of?

Similarly, when I think of the LGBTQ+ community at-large, I think of the decades of inaction around the brutality that trans women of color have faced. Every day, I see large non-profit organizations and privileged white queer people invoke the brilliance of Marsha P. Johnson with no regard for the fact that she was allegedly murdered under circumstances similar to recent Black trans victims like Martin, who was found shot multiple times and left for dead. And if there does happen to be a response from groups or organizations, it’s simply the documenting and sharing of information about the attack — not a deployment of resources to support the Black trans organizers working on these issues every day.

Many people find it difficult to see that violence is intersectional, and that we must analyze it with nuance, understanding that various oppressive systems create the conditions for a specific instance to occur. This is why we often see initiatives that focus on alleviating threats of violence for one specific, marginalized identity group at a time: white cisgender women, white LGBTQ+ people, Black cishet men, and on and on. So when a Black transgender woman like Gibson is murdered, people can’t grasp that she was not only murdered for her gender, but also her race, her sexuality, and her socioeconomic status.

I saw myself in Gibson’s experience because she was also a Black trans woman. But we shouldn't have to have the exact same identities to be concerned about others. A major problem with the cisgender public is that there's a reluctance to truly comprehend our experiences even when we're actually living and breathing. If a Black trans victim’s story does gain some traction, they are inevitably reduced to just a number or a statistic, rather than acknowledged as a human being with loved ones and dreams that they left behind.

To adapt the words of James Baldwin: The reality of being a Black transgender woman in this country is to be in mourning almost all of the time. I don’t have the luxury of choosing which group I care about each day. I ache for the Michael Browns, Tamir Rices, Rekia Boyds, and the Gemmel Moores, but I also ache for the Mesha Caldwells, Keanna Mattels, and Sasha Walls. It’s not uncommon for me to read posts from other Black trans women about the difficulty of making it through the days when we learn that another one of our sisters was slain. We check in with each other via text or phone call, just trying to feel less alone in our mourning because we know that transmisogyny renders our experiences as less than others.

The forces against all marginalized people are overwhelming, and doesn’t seem to be letting up in this political climate of brazen bigotry. Just as we call out the white supremacists or the homophobes, we need to call out the transmisogynists and hold them accountable for their particular brand of terrorism. If we can name that the hateful rhetoric from the current president, his administration, and other conservative politicians has contributed to a culture where the Charleston shooting, the events of Charlottesville, or even this attack on Smollett can happen, let's keep the same energy for naming that the anti-trans rhetoric espoused every day — by public figures and the average person — plays a part in a rampant lack of consideration for trans lives."

CHICAGO - Jussie Smollett's family said Thursday that the attack on the black and gay ""Empire"" actor in downtown Chicago this week was a ""hate crime"" and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn't spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett's family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

(Courtesy of Chicago Police Department via AP)

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielma.

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

The area is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants and has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home, Guglielmi said. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels."

They thanked the public “for their prayers” and said the family is “so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.”

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said. “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

They said such incidents will continue to happen until people are held accountable.

On Tuesday Hart posted on social media about the alleged hate crime committed against Smollett. “Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad,” Hart wrote in a caption of a photo of Smollett. “Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting.”

Hart went on to say in the caption “We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate????”

Police have images of people they’d like to question in Jussie Smollett attack

Smollett, who stars on the TV series “Empire,” told police he was attacked by two people “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” early Tuesday in a Chicago neighborhood.

Smollett plays a gay character on the show and identifies as gay in real life.

Hart ran afoul of the LGBTQ community last year and stepped down from his gig to host the upcoming Oscars ceremony after homophobic tweets he sent years ago resurfaced.

The comedian expressed remorse and told Michael Strahan on “Good Morning America” at the time that he was done apologizing and had “nothing else to prove.”

Hart’s message to Smollett caused some to push back

“Your funniest joke congrats,” TV writer Ira Madison III tweeted.

Hart replied to that tweet with his own.

“I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person,” Hart tweeted. “Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do…CHANGE!”"

(Photo by THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)

CHICAGO — Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

“In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack,” the family writes. “We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.

“Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received,” the statement continues. “We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable.

“Make no mistake, words matter,” the statement concludes. “Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

The original post continues below.

Chicago police have released images of possible persons of interest in the racist, homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett. The Empire actor was exiting a sandwich shop in the early hours of Tuesday morning when two men accosted him—first verbally, using racist and homophobic slurs, and then physically, hitting him and putting a noose around his neck. During the attack, the two were reported to have screamed, “This is MAGA country.”

On Wednesday evening, local authorities released images captured by a surveillance camera; so far, no arrests have been made.

The images are dark, making the two figures captured within hard to identify—but police say they’re reviewing additional cameras. “But now that we’ve got potential persons of interest, the focus will be following their paths. Where did they come from and where did they go?” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Chicago Tribune.

According to the Tribune, Smollett was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for lacerations to his face and is said to be in good condition. On Tuesday, the Chicago Police Department responded to news of the attack with a statement that said, in part, “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses, and establish an investigative timeline.”"

As detailed here by Sister Toldjah last night, the CPD released images of two figures seen walking in the general area of the incident, and implore the public to come forward with any details.

There are more factors that have come to light which cast even more questions into the incident that can to this point be described with any term between “curious” to “bizarre”. At Variety they detailed that Smollett’s music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, was on the phone with Smollett during the incident, and confirms the racial slurs being used during the attack: Moore told Variety that he heard those words being used. “I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,” he said.

But just when you think that something tangible regarding this case has arrived we once again see blockades. Local Chicago news reporter Rob Elgas has been in regular contact with the local police, and more details from that night have been made known. Regarding this phone call things remain unconfirmed.

However, detectives are unable to ""independently verify"" the call occurred because Smollett refused to turn over his phone. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

Attempting to piece together how events may have transpired early Tuesday morning the CPD has put together a variety of images from various surveillance cameras in the area. The first detail to note, the community alert sent out by police places the two figures in the region between 1:30 am-1:45 am. The attack was reported to have happened at 2:00 am.

At no time is there a recording of the episode, and at no time do these two individuals appear on the same camera as Smollett. As police have stitched together the footage the closest connection so far is Smollett being seen on one camera, and the two persons of interest captured on a different camera entirely.

Let me clarify. On one camera the ""persons of interest"" are seated at a bench. ACROSS the same street, Smollett is seen walking. Smollett is recorded on that different camera walking. The ""persons of interest"" are also seen walking, but on the other side of the same street. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

Any of the times noted — with Smollett and the two unknowns — they are said to be walking. No rushing and no running away is reported. The figures are not thought to be approaching anything in a rush, and Smollett is not deemed to be trying to flee anything.

Then the footage starts to raise some high level curiosity. The police have surveillance showing Smollett entering his condo under his own power. He has been out of camera range for less than one minute, and he is clearly seen with the rope around his neck. More odd, once inside he walks by building security, and enters an elevator.

Smollett, according to investigators, walks in to the building, walks by building security and gets on an elevator. This video is better quality according to detectives. And what appears to be road salt is on his sweatshirt. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

This is when the questions stack up far higher than the answers. Beyond a lack of video of a confrontation, there appear to be no indications on tape of Smollett acting in a distressed fashion. He is walking, not in an excitable state. Would someone who had just been attacked simply stroll past a security guard with no mention of a need for assistance?

As for refusing to turn over his phone, that prevents the most solid basis of proof that this incident actually transpired. Note too, in the previous reports, Smollett requested police turn off their body-cams before he gave his statement.

And why would he have never removed the rope from around his neck that was placed there aggressively by attackers? He is not only seen walking into his building with it in place, the police have also said he still had it around his neck when they arrived to first question him, 45 minutes following the attack.

As this case develops and fewer items get resolved it raises the question of how much similar effort police devote to the myriad other violent crimes that transpire in their city."

The star of the TV show ""Empire"" was hospitalized after being attacked in Chicago Tuesday by two people who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, beat him, poured a chemical substance on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck, according to police, who are investigating the attack as a possible hate crime.

Smollett publicly came out as gay in a 2015 interview with Ellen DeGeneres. He said he did it, in part, ""so that people understood that they’re not alone.""

Smollett is not alone in these types of attacks. Data shows anti-black and anti-queer violence is on the rise.

In November, the FBI released hate crime statistics for 2017 that showed a five percent increase in reporting of hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation bias and a 16 percent increase in anti-black hate crimes.

In 2017, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, a national organization which aims to reduce violence among LGBTQ people, recorded reports of 52 hate violence-related homicides of people who identify as LGBTQ, the highest number ever recorded by NCAVP; 60% of the victims were black. Twenty-seven of the hate-violence related homicides were of transgender and gender non-conforming people, and 22 of these homicides were of transgender women of color.

""If you are marginalized in this country you are at greater risk for violent acts, and if you are of multiple marginalized identities that reality is just exacerbated,"" said Jay Brown, Human Rights Campaign's (HRC) deputy director of programs, research and training. ""LGBTQ people, people of color, women, immigrants — if you're living at the intersection of any of these identities you don't know where the motivation for somebody's hateful act is necessarily coming from, and sadly this attack is an example of that.""

Smollett worked with HRC last year on its Equality Rocks campaign.

It's estimated there are more than 1 million LGBTQ African Americans living in the United States, and they face an increased risk of violence not only because of racism, but because of homophobia and transphobia. Smollett's attackers allegedly used racial and homophobic slurs as well as a noose, suggesting he was attacked for being black and being gay. Neither his wealth nor his celebrity status could shield him from hate.

""Privilege doesn't protect,"" said David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition. ""There is data to suggest that the vestiges of anti-blackness and white supremacy are very real and that no member of our community ... is safe.""

Smollett has been released from Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was treated for cuts to his face and neck, and Chicago Police have released images of ""potential persons of interest"" in the attack. Police confirmed to USA TODAY that Smollett said in a follow-up interview a day after the incident that his alleged assailants yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make American Great Again.""

Critics of the slogan have said it's racially charged, and many on Twitter have used the MAGA detail to connect Smollett's attack to the surge of hate crimes and violent rhetoric since Trump's election.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, a watchdog of hate groups, says since Trump stepped on the political stage, it has seen a ""rise in hate crimes, street violence and large public actions organized by white supremacist groups."" Of the 1,094 hate and bias incidents the organization counted in the month after the election, 37% of them directly referenced either Trump, his campaign slogans or his remarks about sexual assault.

Richard Saenz, a senior attorney at Lambda Legal, a national legal organization which advocates for LGBTQ rights, said hate crime laws, which were enacted to protect marginalized communities, alone are not enough. Law is ineffective unless people trust those enforcing them, and Saenz says many LGBTQ people, particularly LGBTQ people of color, do not.

""You can have a law in place but if the people who are in charge of enforcing the law are not being properly trained or if they hold these biases themselves, and they're not being rooted out, the law cannot be an effective tool,"" Saenz said.

In a survey of LGBTQ people conducted by Lamda Legal, almost three-quarters of respondents reported having face-to-face contact with the police in the past five years and more than 20% reported hostile interactions. The group says 57% of transgender people feel unsafe calling police.

Saenz said community efforts to combat racism and homophobia have proven more effective than increased policing.

Brown encouraged those in the LGBTQ community to continue following Smollett's example, to live openly.

""Twenty years ago Matthew Shepard was killed. Twenty years ago James Byrd Jr. was killed. We've been talking about hate crimes for a very long time and we know living visible, open lives, even in the face of this reality, is so important,"" Brown said. ""It doesn't mean it's going to go away tomorrow, but it will change hearts and minds and it will eventually keep these tragic things from happening.""

The tenant, who spoke anonymously to TMZ, said she walked out of the building at 12:30 a.m. Tuesday to take her dogs outside and noticed a man near the door, pacing between the parking lot and entrance, who appeared to be holding a rope.

She described him as a white man with scruff on his face, looking agitated, ""out of place,"" and smoking a cigarette. She said he wore a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up hoodie and short blue jeans with ""thick, grey hunting socks"" and camel-colored dress shoes.

The woman said she noticed what looked like a rope, or a clothesline, protruding from the bottom of his sweatshirt, made from white and blue material.

She said the man was staring at another man, who was standing near another entrance to the building about 300 feet away.

The tenant said she got ""creeped out"" by the man and re-entered the building after five minutes.

When she awoke around 4 a.m. to go to the gym, she asked the concierge about the security around the building and was informed that Smollett was attacked. The concierge gave her two phone numbers, and later that day the woman called a detective involved in the case.

As previously reported, Smollett told police he was attacked by two men early Tuesday morning after they allegedly tied a rope around his neck, threw bleach on his face and yelled homophobic and racial slurs at him.

Police released photos of two potential suspects, showing two men wearing dark clothing. They were allegedly seen walking near the location of the incident between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. Police are calling the men people of interest as they try to determine if the men witnessed the incident or if they were involved.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted on Tuesday that the men were ""in the area of the alleged assault & battery"" of Smollett. ""While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,"" he said.

Guglielmi shared details of the attack with PEOPLE. ""The victim goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men,"" Guglielmi said. ""They were masked and wearing black clothing. They called him an Empire... and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.""

Smollett then returned to his apartment and called his manager, who quickly arrived and determined that they should call the police.

Police patrols ""responded to the residence to take a report and the victim was still wearing the rope around his neck when they arrived,"" Guglielmi said. ""He explained to them why he had the rope around his neck, and the officers closed their body cams at his request, because they were in his private residence."""

Chicago police released photos late Wednesday, with the pictures showing two silhouettes walking down a street late Tuesday morning according to ABC7 Chicago.

“Obviously the alleged statement of what happened here is horrific and there’s no place for it in the city of Chicago,” Mayor Rahm Emanuel said during a Wednesday evening press briefing.

Following the incident, a neighbor of Smollett’s claimed that she saw a “redneck” loitering near the complex she and Smollett live at before the attack took place. Speaking to TMZ, the unidentified woman said she saw a man pacing back-and-forth between the parking garage and the entrance.

She also described what he was wearing, saying he had on a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up hoodie sweatshirt, too-short blue jeans that exposed his “thick, grey hunting socks,” and camel-colored dress shoes.

The woman also noted that the man had a blue and white rope or clothesline hanging from his sweatshirt. Smollett claimed he was attacked with a noose.

Recently, the Chicago Police Department confirmed that the FBI is helping the department with their current investigation on the attack. The CPD is also investigating a letter threat sent to Smollett too. The letter threatening the actor and singer was sent to Fox studio in Chicago on January 22. It contained threatening language and was laced with a powdery substance that investigators believe was Tylenol.

Police said that they “are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.” So far, police have only been able to find one image of Smollett in the area where he says he was attacked. The image was taken from inside a Subway near the location of the attack. Smollett wasn’t with anyone at the time.

“Chicago police detectives continue to investigate serious allegations of a potential racially charged hate crime that took place in the downtown area Tuesday morning around 2am,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said via CNN. “The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras. As of 10pm Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders.”

Although police have confirmed video footage of Smollett walking across the street from the two possible persons of interest, there isn’t video of the actual assault.

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued the following statement (on March 26, 2019 at 1:15 PM EST) in wake of this development: “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”

ORIGINAL: Moving on? Kevin Hart, 39, is more than ready to put his murky past with homophobic slander behind him. However, after sending “prayers” to Jussie Smollett on Twitter, he caught some backlash. Kevin is now defending his decision to support Jussie, following his brutal Chicago attack. “I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person,” the 39-year-old comedian tweeted. “Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do…CHANGE!” he added.

The tweet came in response to criticism from TV writer Ira Madison. After seeing the comedian’s message to Jussie, he felt the comedian was out of line, given his history. “Your funniest joke congrats,” Ira wrote. Kevin stepped down from hosting the 2019 Oscars amid controversy surrounding his notorious resurfaced homophobic tweets, but he was still sure to show support for Jussie, who is a member of the LGBTQ community. “Sending prayers your way @ jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why…” he wrote in a tweet to the actor on Jan. 29.

Kevin was just one of many celebs to speak out in support of Jussie, after he was was viciously attacked in Chicago on Jan. 29, landing him in the hospital. The attack was allegedly conducted by Donald Trump supporters, who yelled, “This is MAGA country,” and occurred at approximately 2 AM. TMZ reports that two men wearing ski masks allegedly placed a noose around the Empire actor’s neck during the attack. It was also alleged that Jussie received an alarming letter, mailed to Fox Studios in Chicago, with cut out letters spelling, “You will die black f–k.”

Investigation is underway regarding the recent Jussie Smollett attack as law enforcement officials and fans alike strive for answers.

One major update came on late Wednesday afternoon when the Chicago Police Department confirmed surveillance footage showing two potential “persons of interest.”

Now, the saga continues as a woman who lives in the same complex as the 35-year-old actor-singer is claiming to have seen a suspicious white man loitering nearby shortly before the reported attack, while she was taking her dogs outside.

The unidentified woman spoke with TMZ, informing them she saw a man she describes as a “redneck” outside of the building she shares with Smollett at around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday pacing back-and-forth between the parking garage and entrance, smoking a cigarette with an agitated demeanor. He was also apparently staring at another man approximately 300 feet away, standing near another entrance.

Hmm, suspicious, indeed.

“He looked out of place,” she said, noting she returned to the building after being “creeped out” by the man.

She described the man as white with facial scruff, wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up hoodie sweatshirt, too-short blue jeans that exposed his “thick, grey hunting socks,” and camel-colored dress shoes.

The most notable thing she claims to have spotted, is a blue and white rope or clothesline hanging from the white man’s sweatshirt. As previously reported, Smollett claimed to CPD that he was attacked with a noose and chemical substance believed to be bleach.

After hearing of Smollett’s attack, the woman informed the building’s concierge, who then directed her to contact detectives.

After news of the horrific hate crime, Kevin posted, “Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting.

But that hasn’t stopped the comedienne from blasting her former celebrity friends. Last week, Mo’Nique said in an interview with Vulture that Whoopi Goldberg has “always been the help.” But now she is saying that Goldberg is her “sister.”

We aren’t sure if Whoopi would agree.

A correspondent with E! News asked Mo’Nique what it would take for her and Goldberg to be in a good place.

“I’m in a good place with everybody,” Mo’Nique answered. “People are offended by the truth. And when people say ‘Mo’Nique dropping shade, she spilling tea.’ I’m 51 years old, baby. I am too damn old to be dropping shade and spilling tea. I’m too old for that.”

She continued, “When people think Whoopi Goldberg and I are in a bad place, we’re not. That’s my sister but when she makes a statement like, ‘I could’ve schooled you.’ Well what you were trying to school me on is how to work for free.” She also said it was “no shade” when she called Goldberg “the help” because there was a time when she was also the help. Watch the full clip below.

As we reported, in an , Mo’Nique during her interview with Vulture talked about her exchange with the Hollywood legend on “The View” last year. The “Precious” star said, “When you have a woman saying, ‘I could have schooled you,’ someone would say, ‘What was the schooling going to be?’ When I look at this woman you say is our icon and our legend — she is.”

She continued, “But, how many things has Whoopi Goldberg executive produced? Whoopi Goldberg has always been the help, and I say that humbly. So what is it that you’re going to school me on? I’ve been doing it for almost 30 years.”

Mo’Nique also dug into Goldberg’s past, “This is a woman who says ‘I could have schooled you,’ and this is a woman who accepted Ted Danson in blackface, and our community praises this woman. So often times, we do it to ourselves. But, I just can’t. Understand, I love my sister. However, when you know you’re being fed the wrong food, you must say, ‘I can’t chew this, y’all.’”

Mo’Nique’s comments stemmed from when she appeared on “The View” about 2018 Netflix boycott. Whoopi told Mo’Nique she could have “schooled” her. See below:

Mo also shared details about a behind the scenes conversation she had with Whoopi, expressing to “The View” co-host that she hoped her boycott would help the future queens in comedy who should know to demand their worth. According to her, Whoopi wasn’t having that either.

“In that moment I knew I was looking at a woman who didn’t give a damn about me,” Mo’Nique said. “And if she’s telling me, ‘Stop worrying about that little girl who not here yet,’ well, she forgot about the ones that came before her who were worried about her.”

Whoopi did not immediately respond to Mo’Nique’s latest comments.

A source revealed to Radar Online, the convicted sex offender who is serving time for his crimes, has assumed the role of his character Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable from The Cosby Show and is playing doctor behind bars and dishing out medical advice to inmates.

The 81-year-old, “believes he learned a lot about how to cure people and speak to patients after playing Dr. Huxtable for nearly eight years on ‘The Cosby Show,’” the source said.

“He is accepting appointments from inmates to help diagnose anything from a cold to obesity. If he thinks they’re incurable, he refers them to the infirmary with a ‘preliminary diagnosis,’” the source admits.

“He told us that he wore a bedsheet like an ‘apron’ to get into character,” the source told the news outlet. “He said his medical skills are ‘a tad rusty’ since he played Dr. Huxtable, but he’s still ‘hip’ to the ‘role.’”

Cosby’s publicist, Andrew Wyatt, admits to Radar Online that Cosby has taken on a leadership role of sorts and “has regular and in-depth discussions about getting better nutrition for the residents…getting them on natural supplements because residents and officers have major health problems.”

Cosby reportedly has criticized the medical staff at the Pennsylvania prison calling them “overeducated, unintelligent children with a clipboard.”

So Cosby has reportedly stepped up to offer up his TV experience as a doctor. One inmate told a relative that “he was told to follow along with whatever Cosby says — play along. He’s old, so the prison staff just want no problems. He hopes to get a job in the infirmary, this way they keep him in there.”

It seems that the powers that be just let Cosby do his thing, as he serves three to 10 years for sexual assault.

“The prison does not intend on moving him, so we just play along to make him feel better!” a source reportedly told the outlet.

Funny how art has become real life.

The racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett outside his Chicago apartment building is still being fleshed out and today we have new details that will hopefully lead to an arrest.

According to TMZ, Jussie’s neighbor says she witnessed a man who looked like a “redneck” hanging out near the building entrance an hour and a half prior to the incident. The unidentified woman says in VERY specific detail exactly who she saw, what they were wearing, and what they were doing.

The woman — who asked us not to use her name — tells TMZ, she walked out of the building at 12:30 AM Tuesday to take her dogs out and saw the man near the door, pacing between the parking garage and entrance, looking agitated and smoking a cigarette. She says, “He looked out of place.” He was a white man with scruff on his face wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood and blue jeans that were too short, exposing “thick, grey hunting socks” with camel-colored dress shoes.

The neighbor also says that there was a rope or clothesline made from white and blue material hanging from underneath the man’s sweatshirt. This man was said to be staring intently on another man near the front door of the building.

When the witness neighbor awoke to go to the gym around 4am, she saw the security and was told that Jussie had been attacked. She relayed what she had seen and was told to call detectives.

Chicago PD still has not found footage of the attack but they are investigating all leads. Hopefully this neighbor’s account helps in that effort."

ABC 7 reporter Rob Elgas said Wednesday that while Chicago police confirmed Smollett and his manager Brandon Moore told investigators that they were on the phone during the attack, the call has yet to be independently verified because the actor won’t give them his cell.

However, detectives are unable to ""independently verify"" the call occurred because Smollett refused to turn over his phone. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

Meanwhile, detectives are reviewing surveillance footage of Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, yet thus far none of the video shows him being attacked, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday. A Chicago Police Department spokesperson said the gender and race of the alleged attackers are presently unknown, despite an initial TMZ report stating they were two white men wearing ski masks.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted two photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi told reporters. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said — although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. The actor alleges that the assailants shouted, “Aren’t you that faggot ‘Empire’ n***r?” at him. His manager told authorities that he heard the alleged attackers tell Smollett, “This is MAGA country.”

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. “We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” he said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, according to police. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant.

The FBI is reportedly investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where Empire is filmed.

When police arrived, Smollett had cuts and wounds and still had the noose around his neck. He went to the hospital after talking with police.

The attackers were wearing ski masks and have not yet been identified. In order to help with their search, Chicago Police have released an image from a camera that they believe could show the attackers.

Chicago Police have also confirmed that a threatening letter was sent to Fox Studios in Chicago, where Smollett works, on January 22.

The letter, according to a picture posted on the pop culture site That Grape Juice, said, “You will die, black fag.” A picture of a stick figure with a noose around its neck being shot was also drawn on the paper.

Police released images showing two figures, both wearing what appear to be dark jackets, walking along a snowy street between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. local time on Tuesday, nearby where Smollett, 35, alleged he was attacked less than an hour later. Smollett reported that he was assaulted by two people carrying a noose and an unidentified “chemical substance” in what police are calling a “possible racially charged assault and battery.”

“While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,” Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday.

Smollett was walking in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street about 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday “when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department said in a statement to The Washington Post. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.”

The police could not confirm the gender of the offenders or identify the chemical substance.

“At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victims neck,” the statement said.

Eventually the offenders fled, and Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Hospital “and is in good condition.”

TMZ reported that Smollett was discharged Tuesday morning. The hospital could not confirm this detail but told The Post that Smollett was not currently a patient.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said.

Smollett told detectives his attackers said “something to the effect of ‘this is MAGA country,’” an apparent reference to President Trump’s enduring “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, during the assault. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the initial police report did not reference those comments, but the actor recalled the information in a follow-up interview with detectives.

Guglielmi said Smollett still had a thin, white rope around his neck when officers first made contact with him around 2:40 a.m., roughly 40 minutes after the alleged assault. He also confirmed that the FBI is investigating a threatening letter that was sent to Smollett on Jan. 22 at the Fox studio in Chicago.

The FBI has not yet responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post.

Fox released a statement Tuesday in support of the actor. “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Smollett’s publicist did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Smollett began his career as a child actor with his siblings, who include actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. He is best known for playing Jamal Lyon on “Empire.” The character is a gay R&B musician who has faced homophobic criticism from his mogul father.

The character struggled with his sexuality before coming out in a buzzed-about Season 1 episode. The plot development led to widespread speculation about Smollett’s sexuality. A month later, Smollett appeared on the TV show Ellen, when he confirmed he is gay.

“It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet, there’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he told TV host Ellen DeGeneres. “I don’t have a closet. But I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home. So that’s why I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is, without a doubt, no closet I’ve ever been in. And I just wanted to make that clear.”

He more directly addressed his sexuality in a 2016 interview with Out magazine. Though Smollett said he was open to falling in love with anyone, he identifies as a gay man.

“I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I don’t know how many times I have to say that,” he told the magazine.

As news of his attack spread Tuesday, Smollett received statements of support from LGBTQ advocacy organizations he has worked with over the years.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” GLAAD said in a statement.

“This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident,” said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities — and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities.”

Last year, the FBI said there was a 17 percent increase in hate crimes in 2017 — the third consecutive year such crimes increased. Of the 7,175 hate crimes reported by United States law enforcement agencies, 2,013 incidents targeted black Americans. 1,130 hate crimes involved people who were targeted based on their sexual orientation.

Messages of support from fans and fellow celebrities for Smollett poured out on Twitter as the news unfolded.

Terrence Howard, the star of Empire, appeared on Good Morning America Wednesday morning, where he said Smollett was improving, though it was difficult.

“I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,” Howard said. “But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

Howard also praised Smollett, saying, “Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood. He’s the one that cheers everybody up. “

Empire co-star Vivica A. Fox tweeted in all caps: “IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!! SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE! PRAYERS UP TO U NEPHEW!”

Lee Daniels, who co-created Empire with Danny Strong, posted a heartfelt and expletive-laden video on Instagram.

“It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this, because Jussie, you are my son,” Daniels said. “You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck . . . You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are. Because it shows we are united on a united front.”

Strong, meanwhile, wrote that he is “deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks.”

Smollett “is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,” Strong tweeted. “Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

“We ALL have a responsibility to rise up against the ignorance and hate out there. If you know who did this . . . REPORT THEM TO THE POLICE,” tweeted Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes.

Grey’s Anatomy actress Caterina Scorsone sent “love and healing” to the actor: “We must tirelessly teach our children about the dignity and sacredness of each and every human being so that this kind of insanity ends. Hate destroys us from within. Teach them to love. It’s on us.”

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Sen. Cory Booke, D-N.J., both weighed in on Twitter, calling the assault a “modern-day lynching.”

“No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin,” tweeted Harris. “We must confront this hate.”"

The swell of support from the world has been enormous. Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted his response to the event: “What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country.

Steve Harvey also used Instagram to show his support: “I just heard about the horrible incident that just happened with our little brother Jussie Smollett.

I just want to say this to little brother Jussie that as a Black man in this country that I’m down with you and I know a lot of brothers that’s down with you.

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent? And at different moments...you're seeing the yin and yang of that, the positive and negative of both. Both are just trying to love this child."

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

The police department shared on Twitter on Wednesday that detectives had located a surveillance camera which shows persons of interest; hours later, photos were released to the public.

The incident occurred on Tuesday morning, a source previously told ET, claiming that Smollett was walking in Chicago when two men started yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, before repeatedly hitting him. According to the source, the men then poured a substance on him believed to be bleach and one of the attackers put a rope around his neck.

A spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department previously told ET that Smollett still had the rope around his neck from the attack when he made contact with officers at 2:42 a.m. on Tuesday. The spokesperson says that Smollett told detectives in a follow-up interview late Tuesday afternoon that his two attackers yelled, “MAGA country” to him during the attack. According to police, the offenders fled the scene.

ET has learned that Jussie's manager Brandon Z. Moore told police he was on the phone with Jussie during the alleged attack. ET has learned Brandon says he told police he clearly heard the MAGA comment in addition to both racial and homophobic slurs. ET has learned Jussie is cooperating with police and the ongoing investigation.

Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to ET on Tuesday that they were investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

""Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire,” the statement read. “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com.""

As for how Smollett is doing following the attack, a source told ET that the 35-year-old actor -- who has received an outpouring of support from his Empire castmates as well as other celebs -- is ""thankful to be alive.""

“Jussie is surrounded by family and friends and is thankful to be alive,” the source said. “Jussie is a fighter and will come out of this stronger.”

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neckbefore fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago on Tuesday in what police are calling a possible hate crime.

Smollett, 35, was walking home around 2 a.m. when two unidentified men approached him, ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a statement. The attackers ""poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim"" as “one of the offenders wrapped a rope around” Smollett's neck before fleeing the scene, according to police.

“The Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show ‘Empire,’” the department said in a statement. “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”

The openly gay actor took himself to Northwestern Hospital following the attack and ""is in good condition,"" CNN reports. No arrests have been made and Chicago PD said it has no suspects. A dozen detectives and the FBI are working the case to identify Smollett's attackers.

Anyone with who has information or witnessed the attack is asked to call detectives at (312) 747-8382 or submit an anonymous tip at cpdtip.com.

So who is Jussie Smollett?

1. He has starred on “Empire” since 2015.

Instagram

Smollett has played the role of Jamal Lyon, the openly gay singer and son of a music mogul couple, on Fox’s “Empire” since 2015.

He has also recently appeared in movies “Alien: Covenant” and “Marshall,” and TV series “Star” and “Underground.”

2. He has gotten a lot of support from Hollywood.

Since his attack, dozens of celebrities have shown their support for Smollett. Among his many supporters are his fellow cast members, multiple activist groups, and celebs, including Stever Harvey, Kevin Hart, Ariana Grande, John Legend, Zendaya, and many, many more. Senator Cory Booker called the attack “an attempted modern-day lynching.”

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement Tuesday regarding the attack.

“We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,"" the statement reads. ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face or any despicable act of violence and hatred — and especially against one of our own.”

3. He publicly addressed his sexuality in 2015.

Although he has never considered himself to be in the closet, Smollett first spoke about being gay in 2015 on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

“There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he said, adding that his decision not to speak about his personal life is not an attempt to “hide or deny who God made me. There is, without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in and I just wanted to make that clear.”

4. He is an activist.

Suicide rates in LGBTQ youth are staggering. You and I can help prevent this. I’m proud to partner with @TrevorProject who are reaching even more LGBTQ youth than ever thanks to @att, and need volunteers to help them grow.

Smollett is a very active AIDS/HIV preventions activist. He is a board member of the Black AIDS Institute and gave a portion of the profits of one of his albums to the organization. He is also a voice for the LGBTQ community. Smollett teamed up with the Trevor Project for its ""How to Save a Life"" campaign to encourage others to become involved in supporting LGBTQ youth and has often been associated with the Human Rights Group.

GLAAD, an organization dedicated to using media to accel LGBTQ acceptance, stands by the actor during this tough time.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” reads a statement from the organization obtained by the Hollywood Reporter.

5. He is a singer.

Smollett released his 10-track debut album Sum of My Music in March 2018. The songs on his first solo album address his struggles with insecurities, jealousy, and his sexuality.

6. This is not the first time he’s been the victim of a hate crime.

Instagram

The FBI is investigating a letter that was sent to Fox and “Empire” offices on Jan. 22. The letter used “threatening language” toward Smollett and was laced with a white powdery substance, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

""Jussie Smollet You will die black f*g,” the letter reportedly read. It has not been linked to the Tuesday attack.

On Wednesday, Hart joined the many famous names tweeting their support for Smollett after the gay ""Empire"" star was hospitalized in an attack that Chicago police are investigating as a potential hate crime.

""Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett,"" Hart wrote on Twitter and Instagram. ""This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards....this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world????""

In response to his tweet, however, many voices on Twitter pointed out Hart's own history of homophobic comments.

Late last year, Hart stepped down as host of the 2019 Academy Awards after Twitter users unearthed several of his old tweets and comedy routines that included homophobic sentiments.

After Hart's initial tweet about Smollett racked up critical replies, he defended himself in a subsequent post, highlighting a tweet by writer Ira Madison III that sarcastically called Hart's message of support for Smollett his ""funniest joke.""

""I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person,"" Hart wrote to his critics. ""Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do...CHANGE!""

Madison shot back: ""I 'harp' because my community of black queer people face violence 365 in America and when we tried to tell you that we weren’t trolling you but wanted to educate how your jokes lead to actions like what happened to Jussie, you went on Ellen to talk about your wheelchair movie.""

Madison continued, ""This is why someone’s jokes about beating their gay son were never funny,"" referencing one of Hart's old unearthed comedy bits, in which he talked about the lengths he would go to prevent his son from being gay.

Many of the other tweets critical of Hart echoed the same sentiments in invoking his past homophobic comments.

""Do you see why the “jokes” weren’t funny now??"" one Twitter user wrote in response to Hart's tweet.

""But keep joking about beating up your kid for being gay, Kevin Hart!"" another tweet read.

“Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible,” Trump tweeted Monday. “Starting to make a turn back? Great!”

There was some irony there considering Trump’s literacy skills are always in question and you would have to be delusional to believe he ever cracks open the Bible. There is already documented proof of the former, and Trump’s former pastor seemed to confirm the latter.

“I was @ realDonaldTrump‘s pastor for 5 years @ MarbleChurch. I assure you, he had the ‘option’ to come to Bible study,” Pastor David Lewicki tweeted in response to Trump cheering for Bible literacy classes. “He never ‘opted’ in. Nor did he ever actually enter the church doors. Not one time.”

Sadly, Trump supporters will not care. Their agenda falls more in line with “white Christian dominance,” which sounds like something right out of Nazi Germany. A powerful piece by Greg Sargent for The Washington Post, titled “The walls around Trump are crumbling. Evangelicals may be his last resort,” argued that the demand for the border wall centers around 45’s white evangelical base.

Robert Jones, the head of the Public Religion Research Institute, told Sargent, “For white evangelicals who see the sun setting on white Christian dominance in the country, the wall is a powerful metaphor. Even if Trump loses support among other parts of his 2016 base, the data suggests white evangelicals may be the last loyalists standing by his side. As Democrats take control of the House and as the Mueller investigation advances, white evangelicals look to be building their own wall of defense around Trump.”

Trump won an entire election on white dominance, so clearly that would be his plan for 2020, even though, according to Forbes.com, 69 percent of Americans do not think the border wall is a priority and 57 percent do not want a government shut down over the wall. However, as Sargent pointed out, 67 percent of white evangelicals want the border wall.

Clearly, Trump is only president for certain Americans.

Jussie Smollett was hospitalized early Tuesday morning after what he claims was a racist and homophobic attack. In his police statement, Smollett said he was approached by two individuals who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him. One of the assailants allegedly smacked him in the face before pouring an “unknown substance” on him and wrapping a rope around his neck.

﻿

“Obviously the alleged statement of what happened here is horrific and there’s no place for it in the city of Chicago,” Emanuel said during a Wednesday evening press briefing about the extreme weather currently affecting the city. “I know the police department is working aggressively to [get] to the bottom of what happened.”

“But I want to be clear about the city of # Chicago and our values,” Emanuel continued. “Look at how we’re responding as the city as a whole taking care of each other. Those are our values.”

On Wednesday, evening, Chicago police released images of two individuals walking on New Street near where the alleged encounter happened between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. on Tuesday morning, although they were unable to identify the people in the video.

Meanwhile, authorities revealed that they had already reviewed hundreds of hours of footage from downtown surveillance cameras, but had yet to find footage of the incident Smollett described. Nevertheless, the incident has drawn fierce condemnation from politicians, celebrities and, other prominent figures across the country, many of whom took to social media to express their support for the actor.

Created by Nelson “Moses” Lassiter and shot in a pseudo-documentary style, “Single Record” follows Aaron Hunter (played by Lassiter), an aspiring New York rapper. Aaron spends most of his days peddling homemade CDs to passersby until his rhyming skills are discovered by Kieran Davis (Wilson Christopher), a newly established music executive. (Check out the “Single Record” trailer above.)

When Aaron’s ego impedes his progress in the recording studio, producer Bizzy Beats (Bryan Fitzgerald) enlists another singer-songwriter, Harmon (Kyle Axman), to help create a hit. After a booze-and-drug-filled afternoon, Aaron and Harmon share a woozy kiss that could have lasting implications.

The Philadelphia-born Lassiter told HuffPost he drew on his personal experiences coming to terms with his sexuality for the six-episode series, currently available on the streaming network Dekkoo and debuting on Revry Feb. 1. To keep “Single Record” true to its subject, the show boasts a soundtrack of all-new music, too.

“As a filmmaker and songwriter, I wanted to use my point of view to tell a story that many people can connect with, whether they are LGBTQ or not,” Lassiter said. Noting that Aaron “finds himself grappling with who he is versus what the industry wants him to be,” he added, “The show addresses what could happen to a person when they feel alone and isolated while uncovering [their] truth.”

Given that the “Single Record” will debut days after “Empire” star Jussie Smollett was attacked in an alleged racist and homophobic hate crime, Lassiter is hopeful his show will prompt reviewers to speak out against discrimination of any kind, as well as “reflect on similar experiences in their lives.”

“When people finish the series, I want them to see life through another’s eyes and be fully aware that every action has a consequence that will not only affect you, but everyone else around you,” he said."

The news outlet reported that the woman, who lives in Smollett’s apartment building, allegedly told police of the man “loitering” outside the building’s entrance before the attack.

The woman told TMZ that she had gone out to walk her dogs when she saw the man whom she said “looked out of place” and was hanging around the building by its entrance and the parking garage. She then described the man in detail to the outlet, including all the clothing he was wearing. She then stated she saw what “looked like a rope or a clothesline” coming out of his sweatshirt. The woman also noted there was another man in the area as well.

It was later that same morning when the now-witness spoke to a member of the concierge in the building and told him what she saw the night before. He encouraged her to contact investigators.

Smollett had returned from New York to Chicago, where he films Empire and had gone to a local Subway sandwich shop to get something to eat in the early morning hours of January 29. CNN reported Smollett was attacked by two men who called him racial and homophobic slurs, poured a chemical on him, and placed a rope around his neck. The outlet added that both attackers fled the scene after the incident.

Police have checked hours of security footage from the area but have yet to see any footage of the alleged incident. CNN reported that there was footage uncovered of Smollett standing inside the Subway sandwich shop alone.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi issued a statement to CNN on January 30 that described the status of the investigation.

“The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras. As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find a video to be able to release a public description of the offenders.”

CBS Chicago reported on January 31 there has since been a video found that shows “persons of interest” in this possible hate crime. The outlet shared a contact number for anyone with information on the attack, asking people to contact Area Central Detectives at (312) 747-8380 or reach out anonymously at www.cpdtip.com.

Pictures of two shadowy figures released last night — Chicago Police are calling them “persons of interest” — will only add to the controversy.

As I reported here at PJ Media yesterday, Smollett claims he was physically assaulted by two individuals wearing ski masks and gloves at 2 a.m. Tuesday in downtown Chicago. They allegedly shouted, “This is MAGA country,” along with other racist and anti-gay slurs. Smollett, who had just visited a Subway sandwich shop, is black and gay and had been a harsh critic of Donald Trump for years prior to his presidential campaign.

But shifting versions of the story told by Smollett have raised questions about what exactly happened.

For instance, Smollett initially was reluctant to make any kind of statement, but in his initial interview with police 45 minutes after the alleged attack, he made no mention of the MAGA claims.

When that element was reported by TMZ and other media outlets, Chicago Police denied the claim. But after contacting him a second time, Smollett expanded his version of the story to include the MAGA element.

The Associated Press reported yesterday that police have reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance video from the heavily monitored area, but found no images of the attack. The city of Chicago operates an advanced linked network of 30,000 closed-circuit cameras around the city, the New York Times reported last May.

Last night, Chicago Police announced they had two possible persons of interest and released shadowy photos of the pair.

While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed pic.twitter.com/xJDDygtocr — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) January 31, 2019

There is no video, however, of the two individuals and Smollett ever being together. The time of the videos is between 1:30 and 1:45 a.m., at least 15 to 30 minutes before the time of the alleged attack, according to local media.

The local ABC affiliate reported:

Police said they have tracked Smollett’s movements that night. They confirmed video shows Smollett walking across the street from the two possible persons of interest. Police said in the video he walks out of frame for about a minute and reappears on another camera “wearing a rope like a neck tie.” Police said there is no video of an assault. Investigators said he walked into an apartment building, passing security and boarding an elevator. He would then enter an apartment and that’s where police were eventually called.

Reporter Rob Elgas, who has seen the video recording, gave details about what the video shows:

Police say both Smollett and the ""persons of interest"" walk out of frame (on different cameras). Smollett would reappear on a different camera about a minute later. So basically for about 60 seconds Smollett is not on surveillance camera. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

The next time Smollett is seen on surveillance camera, he is entering a condo building. Police say he now has a rope around his neck and is ""wearing it like a neck tie"". About a minute (maybe less) has passed since he was seen on video. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

On Tuesday, Elgas reported another odd element to the story: that Smollett was still wearing the rope around his neck when they arrived to interview him — nearly 45 minutes after the incident.

As noted, there is no video of the alleged attack, nor is there any video of the two persons of interest together with Smollett.

Unfortunately, some media outlets got ahead of the facts yesterday, falsely claiming that video of the incident had emerged and that the photos that were to be released were of “suspects.” This included the New York Daily News, whose tweet below got more than 1200 retweets before it was deleted:

Another new angle developed yesterday when Variety reported that Smollett’s music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, claimed he was on the phone with his client at the time of the attack and heard the “MAGA country” comment and the racial slurs.

But oddly, Smollett has refused to let Chicago Police inspect his phone to confirm that the call had in fact occurred.

Concurrent to the Chicago Police Department’s investigation into Tuesday morning’s alleged incident, the FBI is investigating letters sent to Smollett earlier this month at the Fox offices in Chicago, according to the Chicago Tribune:

Chicago police confirmed that a letter containing an anti-gay epithet and white powder were mailed to the Douglas Park neighborhood Cinespace Chicago Film Studios, where “Empire” is filmed, on Jan. 22. The letter, addressed to one of the show’s actors, triggered a hazardous materials call for fire officials, who determined the powder wasn’t dangerous. The FBI has since taken over the probe into the letter — as it was sent through the U.S. mail service — while Chicago police continue to look into the attack, authorities said.

The letter arrived on January 22, and was first reported by ThatGrapeJuice.net, who provided an image of what had been sent (via TMZ.com):

TMZ also reported that Smollett refused 24/7 security at the time the letter was received, claiming that it would be intrusive.

Fox had offered additional security to everyone on set, but Smollett said that the security would interrupt his way of life. He will now have 24/7 armed security after Tuesday’s incident, they added.

With the widespread coverage this story is getting, one might hope that more conclusive details will be forthcoming shortly, given the accusations and attempts of cultural and political point-scoring that have emerged from some corners following this incident."

Police have confirmed that Smollett was seen on video walking away from the persons of interest before appearing again in the video with a noose around his neck.

The Blast reports:

“Police detectives have located surveillance cameras that show potential people of interest in the alleged assault and battery that was reported,” Chicago PD said in a statement regarding the investigation.

The police say, “While the video footage does not depict an assault, the individuals pictured are seen in the vicinity” of where the incident went down.

Officials are now going through the video and putting together a sample to hand out to the public in the hopes of identifying the possible suspects.

As we reported, police have been combing the area near Smollett’s luxury high-rise apartment ever since he claims to have been attacked in a racial and homophobic-fueled tirade.

In a screen grab from the surveillance video, two men in dark clothing are seen near the location of the attack but police aren’t saying just yet that they are suspects.

Stars have been rallying around Smollett, who appeared to be on the mend based on released photos of him recovering in a local hospital.

Howard said he was on-set when he learned that Smollett was attacked, E! News reports.

“Jaws dropped to the ground,” he said. “And then when we learned that there had been letters that had been sent to Fox as threats about the potential of something like this, then we became much more frightened.”

The 36-year-old actor and singer was brutally beaten by two men wearing ski masks in Chicago early Tuesday morning. They reportedly doused the openly gay actor with bleach and tied a noose around his neck while shouting “MAGA country.”

According to the reports, Smollett was walking out of Subway when someone yelled “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n*****?” before attacking him.

Howard, who plays Lucious Lyon on the hit Fox series, said even though the attack was a hateful one, he knows that Smollett will be forgiving of his foes.

“Jussie’s anger will dissipate, and he will forgive these people for what they did,” Howard said. “But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

Howard also described Smollett as a light who tried to uplift everyone.

“Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood,” he added. “He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping….Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family—you know, the Fox family, the Empire family, the Lyon family—you know, were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.”

Persons of interest sought

According to TMZ, investigators have captured multiple persons of interest on surveillance video and plan to release photos to the public in an effort to bring them in for questioning.

While they didn’t refer to the individuals as “suspects,” they plan to release the images soon.

The Chicago Police Department issued a statement on the incident:

“A 36-year-old man was walking at above address when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him. The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene. The victim self-transported to Northwestern Hospital and is in good condition. Area Central Detectives are investigating.”

Chicago Police Department Chief Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told E! News that it was a “possible racially-charged assault and battery.” Guglielmi added, “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.”

Celebs stand with Jussie

A number of celebs have launched campaigns of support on social media to stand with the Empire star after the reported attack.

Empire creator Lee Daniels posted an emotional Instagram video.

“You didn’t deserve to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die f––––t, n––––r,’ or whatever they said to you. You are better than that,” Daniels said in his Instagram video. “We are better than that. America is better than that.

Halle Berry, Gabrielle Union, Andy Cohen, Ellen DeGeneres, Lenny Kravitz, Tyler Perry, Steve Harvey offered words of support an encouragement.

Taraji P. Henson who plays the mother of Smollett’s Empire character posted a lengthy message to Smollett in support along with a snippet of his very timely video F**ked Up World.

“I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now.@jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!!

TMZ adds that a woman who lives in Smollett’s apartment building saw a suspicious man just an hour and a half before the Empire actor was attacked by two men who poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck while using racist and homophobic slurs.

TMZ reports: ‘The woman — who asked us not to use her name — tells TMZ, she walked out of the building at 12:30 AM Tuesday to take her dogs out and saw the man near the door, pacing between the parking garage and entrance, looking agitated and smoking a cigarette. She says, “He looked out of place.” He was a white man with scruff on his face wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood and blue jeans that were too short, exposing “thick, grey hunting socks” with camel-colored dress shoes. She says she noticed what looked like a rope, or a clothesline, protruding from the bottom of his sweatshirt, made of white and blue material. She says he was staring at another man about 300 feet away, who was standing near another entrance to the building. She says she got “creeped out” by the man, and after 5 minutes she retreated back into the building.’

Jussie Smollett was seen on surveillance cameras walking down the same street as the two people police are calling 'persons of interest' in their investigation into the homophobic attack on him, it has been revealed.

Smollett was filmed on surveillance cameras walking home from Subway at around 2am on Tuesday.

The two suspects were filmed by a different camera sitting on a bench on the same street but on the opposite side from where Smollett was.

They were then filmed standing up and walking down the street at the same time as him.

Then, all three walked out of the cameras' view, according to ABC.

Smollett was picked up by surveillance cameras no more than a minute later as he walked into his condo building with a rope around his neck.

He had road salt on his sweatshirt which indicated he had been thrown to the ground.

The Empire star then waited 40 minutes before a friend called 911 to report that he had been attacked.

'Photos (pictured) of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,' police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Wednesday evening

When police arrived at the luxury apartment building where he stays while filming the Fox show, Smollett had the rope he says was tied in a 'noose' around his neck by his attackers but it was slack, according to police.

He then took himself to hospital to be treated for cuts on his face.

'That I can tell you is horrible. I've seen it ... last night. It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned' President Trump

On Thursday, President Trump condemned the attack as 'horrible'.

'That I can tell you is horrible. I've seen it ... last night. It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.'

It is not clear if the person who called 911 was his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, who says he was on the phone to him when the attack happened and corroborated his claim that the attackers shouted 'this is MAGA country!'.

When Chicago PD detectives asked Smollett for his cell phone to verify that he and Moore had been on the phone, he refused to hand it over.

'I don't know if it was a privacy issue or what,' police spokesman Anthony Guglieme said on Thursday morning.

The more detailed timeline emerged hours after a neighbor told TMZ that she saw a 'redneck' man loitering outside their apartment building at 12.30am - 90 minutes before the attack - while she took her dogs out.

The men were not filmed attacking Smollett but were seen near where the attack took place at around the same time

SMOLLETT FAMILY SPEAKS OUT The actor's famous family released this statement on Thursday: 'In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. 'We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. 'Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. 'Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. 'We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.' Advertisement

DailyMail.com confirmed that the woman gave a statement to the police but detectives have not yet confirmed what she saw even though there are security cameras at the apartment complex.

The unnamed neighbor told TMZ that she saw two men outside the building.

One had a piece of rope hanging out of his sweatshirt, she said.

'He looked out of place,' she said, describing him as a white man who was wearing a blue sweatshirt, a blue beanie and jeans that were too short and exposed 'thick grey hunting socks.'

Most notable was that the man, who she said was agitated and smoking a cigarette, was carrying a blue and white rope or 'clothesline' which was protruding out from his zip-up sweater.

There was another man about 300ft away, she said, nearer the entrance. The woman said she was 'creeped out' by the pair and went back inside after five minutes.

When she woke up at 4am, there was lots of security round the building, she said.

Once the concierge told her what had happened to 36-year-old Smollett, she relayed to him what she had seen.

Smollett and his manager Brandon Z. Moore both told police they were on the phone when the attack happened. Moore said he heard the attackers yell 'this is MAGA country'. It is not clear if he is the person who called 911 or if it was someone else but Smollett refused to hand over his phone when police asked for it to verify that they had been on the phone

The concierge implored her to phone the police, she said, which she did.

Her description came hours after Chicago Police Department released still images of two persons of interest.

The neighbor's version of events suggests that the two attackers were lying in wait for Smollett outside his apartment building.

Smollett had arrived back in Chicago late after having his flight from New York City delayed. The star lives in Chicago while filming the Fox series Empire.

He was in New York for a reading of the play Take Me Out, which tells the story of a gay baseball player.

Before he flew back to Chicago, he posted on Instagram about the delayed flight and about a show he is set to perform on Saturday night in Los Angeles.

The exact spot where he was attacked sits in between two luxury apartment buildings and two hotels but police say they have not recovered any surveillance footage of it.

A week before he was attacked, the star received a death threat letter at the network's studio but turned down security because he found it 'intrusive'.

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

The release of the surveillance photos comes just hours after officers said they were unable to find an footage that showed two men attacking the actor.

Officers said that detectives reviewed CCTV video of Smollett walking to his apartment building in downtown Chicago Tuesday morning, and ‘for the most part’ they can confirm the route he took when he says he was accosted by the assailants.

Authorities said a community alert with photos is being constructed and will be disseminated shortly.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime and have already looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area.

Officers expanded the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the crime scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

The attack took place here, in the street, outside the apartment building where Smollett stays while he is in Chicago filming. It is in between two luxury apartment buildings and two hotels but police say they have not yet recovered surveillance footage of it

Smollett is due to perform on Saturday in Los Angeles

‘We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,’ Guglielmi said earlier on Wednesday, referring to a container for the liquid that was thrown at the actor.

Smollett has not commented since the incident

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the US, with thousands of CCTV cameras mounted on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

The letter threatening Smollett was sent to the Fox studio on January 22 and was laced with a powdery substance believed to be Tylenol.

The FBI is now trying to determine if there's a link between the homophobic letter and the Tuesday attack.

Following the accident Fox has added security for the rest of the Empire cast.

Much of the cast live in Chicago during filming.

Smollett missed shooting on the set on Tuesday as he recovered from the brutal attack.

He reportedly still intends to return to the set and Empire will resume as planned.

The production has halted filming in Chicago due to the severe cold weather and not because of what happened to Smollett.

20th Century Fox released a statement confirming the incident earlier in the week which read: 'We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night.

'We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice.

'The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.'"

The neighbor, who chose to remain unidentified, said, “She walked out of the building at 12:30 AM Tuesday to take her dogs out and saw the man near the door, pacing between the parking garage and entrance, looking agitated and smoking a cigarette. She says, ‘He looked out of place.’ He was a white man with scruff on his face wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood and blue jeans that were too short, exposing ‘thick, grey hunting socks’ with camel-colored dress shoes.”

She described him as looking like a “redneck.”

She also said saw “what looked like a rope, or a clothesline, protruding from the bottom of his sweatshirt, made of white and blue material.” The neighbor also claimed there was another man about 300 feet away, who near another entrance to the building. She was “creeped out” by the man, and after 5 minutes she went back in the building.

TMZ also reported the neighbor went to the building’s gym at 4 a.m. and saw a lot of security. The concierge explained the actor was attacked, she said.

“When she told him what she saw, the concierge implored her to call a detective and gave her two phone numbers,” TMZ wrote. “She made contact that afternoon and downloaded a detective.”

“Chicago police detectives continue to investigate serious allegations of a potential racially charged hate crime that took place in the downtown area Tuesday morning around 2 a.m. The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras.

Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders. Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect’s vehicle to be able to share.

We are taking this investigation very seriously and detective teams will broaden our search area and work around the clock to look for video on traffic cameras, CTA buses and neighboring thoroughfares which could have captured the offender’s movements.

Good Thursday morning, Illinois. Thankful to have hitched a ride from Springfield to Chicago after Amtrak canceled trains. Big bonus: heated seats in my ride’s car.

THE BUZZ

And they’re off! Lawmakers already have a bill in place to raise the minimum wage from $8.25 to $15 an hour. And business interests, which have traditionally fought a wage hike, appear to be on board.

Rob Karr, who heads the powerful Illinois Retail Merchants Association, is warm to the idea of a minimum wage increase that includes a tiered scale based on living costs in different parts of the state. Similar approaches have been adopted in New York and Oregon, for example. And Karr recommends an extended phase-in period for reaching $15.

A draft measure was taken up Wednesday by the Senate Labor Committee. Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford says details need to be worked out before it goes to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who wants to sign it into law before he gives his Feb. 20 budget speech.

“We’re very committed to keeping everyone at the table, providing an opportunity to express how a minimum wage increase will work with their entity,” Lightford said of the legislation. A jump to $15 “can’t be a significant jump. It has to be over a period of time to allow business to adjust.”

State lawmakers approved a $15 minimum wage two years ago, but then-Gov. Bruce Rauner vetoed the measure, saying it would lead to job losses at the low end of the wage scale — the people the minimum wage is supposed to help. Journal-Star’s Doug Finke has details here .

MORE BUZZ

By the time the votes are counted in the April 2 mayor runoff election, the legislative session in Springfield will be halfway over. That means the new mayor and the City Council will have little time to get on the same page regarding what they want from Springfield on funding public schools, special-ed programs, teacher pensions and a capital bill.

The mayor’s race continues to be fluid and the Council looks like it could be weakened by retirements and scandals. At the same time, the new mayor and the Council will need “a strong, unified voice” to make the case for those funding requests, says House Majority Leader Greg Harris. “You need a mayor who has the power and support across the city to have a solid, unified agenda. Having that political oomph will help get it done in Springfield.”

Chicago’s new administration will also need to work in tandem with Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s team to lure new business to the city. Pritzker has declared himself the state’s “promoter in chief,” a mantle former Mayor Rahm Emanuel also claimed.

The good news for Chicago is that Springfield will be more friendly to the city’s interests than it was during four years under an administration that eviscerated the economic development agencies. It’s going to “feel very different” than the previous four years, said Michael Sacks, who heads Grosvenor investment firm and served on Pritzker’s transition team.

BURKE FALLOUT

— Retiring Ald. Danny Solis resigned yesterday as chairman of the Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards committee. “My resignation is effective immediately,” he wrote in a brief memo to the clerk.

— How Solis used campaign cash: A bombshell federal court document laying out a potential corruption case against Solis depicts a politician who is badly in debt — and who appears to have used campaign funds for personal expenses. The 120-page affidavit obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times describes nearly $17,000 in personal expenses appearing on a credit card account for Solis’ 25th Ward Regular Democratic Organization for trips to a hair salon, toddler clothes and school tuition. Sun-Times’ Jon Seidel has the story here .

— Former Gov. Bruce Rauner laughed and said he’s not surprised that Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan would pop up in the secret recordings of the FBI’s investigation of Solis. “It certainly would have served Illinois if this had come out 20 years ago,” Rauner said of revelations contained in a federal affidavit. Sun-Times’ Tina Sfondeles has a story here .

— The intersection of Michael Madigan’s dual roles as Illinois House speaker and private property tax appeal lawyer gained the spotlight once again Tuesday, as the veteran politician was dragged into a burgeoning City Hall influence-peddling scandal. By Tribune’s Jeff Coen and Ray Long. Story here

— Aldermen demand Solis come ‘out of the shadows’ and apologize — or resign, reports Sun-Times Fran Spielman. “He owes his voters an explanation and should address the charges. If there’s more to it and he’s innocent and going to fight for his reputation and his legacy, no good comes out of hiding,” said Ald. Ray Lopez. Story here

— Connecting some dots: The Sun-Times says most of the personal purchases and payments described in the affidavit about Solis were made on 25th Ward credit cards in the name of Solis and his sister, Grace Perales. It’s worth noting that Perales was the longtime office manager of the United Neighborhood Organization (UNO), which got caught up in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation in 2013 related to a bond deal. Solis’ wife, Mary Jane, also worked at UNO for a time as a school teacher. UNO’s backstory here .

— Unrelated lawsuit involving Solis. Property Markets Group (PMG), which is suing the city over a proposed development in Solis’ ward, wants to depose the alderman about the PMG deal. The company has hired Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel for the case. Spiro is a former Manhattan prosecutor whose clients include Jay-Z, several NBA players, and witnesses in the Mueller investigation.

“We don’t know” how long Solis will be available for deposition, Spiro told POLITICO. “We have a lot of questions.”

PMG wanted to build a 400-home development that included affordable housing in Pilsen but was blocked due to a zoning challenge. Solis had wanted to downzone the parcel of property at 18th and Peoria streets for industrial use instead. The squabble was another in the debate about gentrification in Pilsen. There was a debate as to how much of the project should be affordable housing in the gentrifying neighborhood, and PMG sued. The case was supposed to have a hearing yesterday but it was delayed by weather. In wake of the Solis’ involvement in the corruption investigation into Ald. Ed Burke, PMG wants answers about how its property debate with Solis came about. Tribune’s John Byrne has more about the lawsuit here .

— Ald. Matthew O'Shea says he “made a bad joke about a serious matter” when he learned Solis wore a wire in the corruption case against fellow Ald. Ed Burke. At the time, O’Shea said “Where I come from, if you wear a wire someone’s going to kick your ass.” The comment drew criticism for sounding a lot like a character out of the “Soprano’s.” In a letter to the Tribune, O’Shea said the comment “was an ill-advised and poorly timed attempt at humor during a conversation I had with reporters. I am a full-time alderman who works hard to deliver honest service to my ward and do it free of any real or perceived conflicts that might come from pursuing personal business interests. As such, I am deeply troubled by any allegations of City Council members using their political influence to enrich themselves. I regret that my comment did not convey the seriousness of the situation.” His letter here .

CAMPAIGNS

— This just in: Cubs co-owner Laura Ricketts is endorsing Susana Mendoza for mayor. According to a release sent out this morning, Ricketts will serve as campaign co-chair. “Susana Mendoza has outlined an outstanding plan to fight corruption and raise the standard of ethics and accountability in city government,” Ricketts said in the release.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

RELATED: Minneapolis Police Chief Can’t Release George Floyd Bodycam + He’s Fighting with Police Union on Reform

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

For one thing, it’s so cold in Chicago that they’re setting fires to keep the trains going . Don’t worry, the fires aren’t on the tracks; they run adjacent to the rails. It’s routine practice for the city’s transit system when the weather gets this cold.

SNAPSHOTS

Chicago police have released surveillance images of possible suspects in Jussie Smollett’s alleged assault. Police said the Empire actor reported that two people yelled anti-gay and racist slurs as they beat him early Tuesday in what investigators are treating as a potential hate crime.

A mom allegedly poured water on her sleeping baby’s face for keeping her up at night and posted it on Facebook. Caitlin Hardy was charged with cruelty to children after she apparently filmed herself waking her infant daughter up by tipping a water bottle onto her nose and mouth.

A man was ordered to pay $21,000 in fuel costs after being so drunk that his flight was forced to land.

This woman found revenge porn on Google Drive — and now she’s fighting back

When A. was 17, she found her nude photographs on a Google Drive. The drive also contained folders labeled with the real names of nearly 5,000 women and girls.

Each folder was filled with dozens of images. Some were clothed, several were naked, most of them were stolen.

In Pakistan, where A. lives, her story could be seen as a cautionary tale. But instead of being fearful, she began reaching out to the other women affected.

When we first spoke to A., she was determined to become one of the only Pakistani women to speak openly about her nudes being leaked. What followed revealed the crossroads at which women find themselves when they want to “do the right thing” but must be cautioned against being too brave.

This guy accidentally fell asleep on Twitch and woke up to hundreds of people watching

Two things: 1) I don’t control what goes viral; 2) This is one of those things that sound weird but are actually quite nice.

Jesse Daugherty started streaming on Twitch last year. He had a few followers, but for the most part he just enjoys hanging out on the platform.

Last week, while streaming live, he nodded off. No one was even watching when he fell asleep.

During his nap, his channel blew up with hundreds of people watching him doze. The chat was reacting to his every move — and this went on for three hours.

You should watch the endearing and wholesome clip of him waking up and realizing just how many people were watching his stream."

One of his white staffers told him, ""back in the day, you would have been buried with a shovel.""

That same year, a man in Riverside, California, was videotaped hanging a noose on the fence between his house and the house of a mixed-race couple.

In September, a white high school student put a noose around the neck of a black classmate in Ouachita, Louisiana.

In October, a retired firefighter in Grapevine, Texas, hung a doll by the neck on the railing in front of a black neighbor's apartment in an attempt to intimidate the family.

Lynching may seem like something out of the distant past, but the use of lynching symbolism to terrify, intimidate and curtail the lives of black Americans is very much happening today, say civil rights advocates.

Search the word ""noose"" in Google News and 18 pages of returns appear, most describing recent instances where the ominous and iconic hangman's knotted rope was used to incite fear. The stories have largely remained local news.

That changed Tuesday when assailants in Chicago allegedly attacked “Empire” star Jussie Smollett, yelling racist and homophobic slurs, punching him in the face, pouring bleach on him and wrapping a rope around his neck.

'Empire' star attack: Jussie Smollett case: Police search for persons of interest in Chicago

Just as in the less-reported incidents, that rope carried with it a chilling and violent message, hearkening back to more than a hundred years of murder and intimidation as lynching was used to keep African-Americans from claiming their civil rights and even basic human freedoms after the end of slavery in the United States.

The symbolism of the noose has continued to be used by racists, though for a time it became less common. That appears to be changing, with an increase in racist and xenophobic attacks by people who appear emboldened since the election of President Donald Trump, say civil rights groups.

In Smollett’s case, the attackers allegedly yelled, “This is MAGA country,” an allusion to Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.”

“This particular president of the United States seems to be more tolerant of those who would buy into a more discriminatory ideology, in some cases almost telling them that it’s OK to do these things,” said Hilary O. Shelton, director of the NAACP’s Washington, D.C., bureau.

Congress has yet to enact a law making lynching a federal crime, though the Senate did unanimously pass the Justice for Lynching Act in December.

“For over a century, members of Congress have attempted to pass some version of a bill that would recognize lynching for what it is: a bias-motivated act of terror. And for more than a century, and more than 200 attempts, this body has failed,” Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said at the introduction of the legislation.

Because the House did not vote on the bill before the 2018 congressional session ended, Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Booker plan to reintroduce the legislation within the next two weeks, her office said.

“What happened to Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexual orientation or color of their skin. The Justice for Victims of Lynching Act is needed now more than ever,"" Harris said in a statement to USA TODAY. She and Booker plan to reintroduce the bill in the coming weeks. Harris is running to become the first black woman president in 2020.

There are no statistics available on the number of hate crimes involving nooses or lynching imagery in the United States. But hate crimes overall are increasing. Hate crimes spiked 17 percent in 2017, according to FBI statistics.

Trump's rhetoric ""has unleashed our demons,"" said Heidi Beirich, director of the intelligence project at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama.

Since launching his run for the White House, Trump has called Mexicans rapists, referred to Haiti and African nations as ""shithole countries"" and self-identified as a ""nationalist.""

In all, 7,175 hate incidents were voluntarily reported in 2017, up from 6,121 in the previous year. Almost 60 percent of them were based on the person's race or ethnicity. It was the third year in a row the numbers rose.

Civil rights leaders say the true number of hate attacks are likely much higher, in part because the FBI numbers are based on reporting from local jurisdictions and not all police departments track hate crimes. FBI Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in November that 88 percent of law enforcement agencies that provide hate crime data to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report reported none in 2016.

“We’re not capturing more than 5 percent of the racial violence that happens in this country,” estimates Beirich.

Terror and intimidation

Jack Shuler, a professor of black studies at Denison University in Ohio and author of ""The Thirteenth Turn: A History of the Noose,"" tracks lynching-related incidents. He says he’s seen an uptick since 2016.

“I thought for a while they were kind of petering out, but definitely after Trump was elected we’ve been seeing more of them,” he said.

In the years after the Civil War, lynching became a standard tactic to provoke fear in African-American communities, to keep them from voting or demanding their rights or even from running a business that might threaten a white person’s earning abilities.

Lynching wasn’t just hanging. “People were mutilated, tortured. Burned alive. It’s a horrible history,” said Shuler.

A study by the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Alabama, documented more than 4,384 lynchings between the end of Reconstruction in 1877 and in 1950. In 2018, the group opened the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which honors lynching victims.

“The most visceral racist images in American history are the noose and the burning cross. White supremacists have used them to intimate and oppress black people since the founding of this country,"" said Beirich. ""There’s just no mistaking what a noose means.”

The message is never lost on those at whom it is aimed. While he was researching his book, Shuler interviewed several people who had nooses used to intimidate them at work. One was Michael McKnight, who in 2010 was the first black person to work at General Cage, a factory that manufactures pet cages in Elwood, Indiana.

Seven days after he began, a noose was hung on the factory’s time clock.

""When I talked to him, he said, 'I pictured myself with that noose around my neck, hanging from a tree,'"" Shuler said."

Police say the footage does not capture the actual attack—in which Smollett says he was beaten and had a rope wrapped around his neck—but it shows the two men in the vicinity of the attack around the same time it took place, Page Six reports. Smollett, who is black and openly gay, says he was attacked after leaving a Subway restaurant around 2am by two white men in ski masks shouting racist and homophobic slurs. Police say the attack is being treated as a possible hate crime.

The two individuals seen in the footage are not being described as suspects at this point, but police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says anybody with information on their identities should contact detectives, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. ""They could have been the perpetrators, they could have been witnesses, they could have been complete bystanders who didn’t see the incident at all,"" he says. ""There are still a lot more cameras that we have to look at. It’s almost like a digital puzzle. You have to put all of those pieces together and kind of watch them at the same time."" (Lawmakers and showbiz figures have rallied around Smollett, who suffered a fractured rib in the attack.)

The 39-year-old actor was just one of the celebrities sending his love to Jussie after the horrific attack, which saw him beaten, poured with an unknown chemical substance and a noose tied around his neck. It’s believed the incident was homophobic and racially-motivated, and Chicago Police Department are trying to hunt down the two male attackers.

On Tuesday, Kevin tweeted: “Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.”

However, Kevin’s words attracted criticism on Twitter, with TV writer Ira Madison III referencing the former homophobic tweets sent by Kevin which led to his decision to step down as host of the 2019 Academy Awards.

Kevin has apologised numerous times for the tweets, which have since been deleted, and insisted in a reply to Madison on Wednesday that he should be given the chance to move on from the scandal.

“I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologised about and moved on from by being a better person,” he wrote. “Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do…CHANGE! (sic)”

Kevin’s words came as the Chicago P.D. released surveillance pictures of persons of interest they want to talk to in relation to the attack. The images, tweeted on Wednesday, show two masked men wearing all-black, walking in an area near to Jussie’s home.

“While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,” Chicago P.D.’s Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted alongside the pictures."

Detectives had not yet found still images or video of the actual incident as of late Tuesday evening, police told CNN.

Empire’ star, Jussie Smollett has been violently attacked in an apparent homophobic and racist hate crime that left him hospitalized.

One of Jussie’s close friend said the actor arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday, and at around 2 AM he was hungry and went to a Subway with plans to get food.



It was on his way that he was attacked by two whites who had allegedly called Jussie a faggot before they pounced on him.

He fought back, but they allegedly beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left, they yelled, ‘This is MAGA country.’

Jussie was taken to Northwestern Memorial where he was treated. He was discharged later Tuesday morning.



Authorities in Chicago said they are investigating the attack as a possible hate crime, and they are searching the area for any video as more evidence.



It can be recalled that this isn’t the first time Jussie is being targeted by homophobes.

Few days ago, a letter was sent to Fox Studios in Chicago with cut out letters spelling, “You will die black fag.” The letter was said to be meant for Jussie.

The envelope that was used to deliver the letter was inscribed ‘MAGA’ in the upper left corner.

The president receives his intelligence briefing

The president meets with the vice premier of the People’s Republic of China

It’s freakin’ cold

It is really cold. So far, this cold business has claimed the lives of 12 people in the Midwest. “At least a dozen deaths related to extreme cold weather have been reported since Saturday in Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, according to officials and media reports.”

A student was found dead on the campus of the University of Iowa. The National Weather Service said the temperature was -51 degrees at the time. If you are somewhere cold, stay indoors!

Trump: Ryan reneged on deal to fund border wall

If you have been paying attention to politics for a while, Trump’s remarks will not surprise you. Many people wondered why Trump didn’t just get this wall business done during the last Congress when the GOP controlled both the House and the Senate. Well, now we find out why — straight from the President’s mouth:

“Well, I was going to veto the omnibus bill and Paul told me in the strongest of language, ‘Please don’t do that, we’ll get you the wall.’ And I said, ‘I hope you mean that, because I don’t like this bill,’” the president recounted in an exclusive Wednesday interview with The Daily Caller. “Paul told me in the strongest of terms that, ‘please sign this and if you sign this we will get you that wall.’ Which is desperately needed by our country. Humanitarian crisis, trafficking, drugs, you know, everything — people, criminals, gangs, so, you know, we need the wall.” “And then he went lame duck,” Trump said. “And once he went lame duck, it was just really an exercise in waving to people and the power was gone so I was very disappointed. I was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed. And I’ll get the wall.”

The DC asked Trump, “did Ryan lie to you?” The president responded that he did not think Ryan lied to him. At the time, Ryan meant what he said. Trump is being charitable.

Um, no. Most of the GOP do not want a wall and do not want to reform immigration. The GOP leadership is the party of Mitt Romney and Jeb! Most of them get money from the beneficiaries of cheap labor — pool boys and maids. Failure theater, people, just more failure theater.

Cops release suspect photos in Jussie Smollett hate crime

So a duo of MAGA-hat wearing white criminals in Chicago allegedly beat up “Empire” star Jussie Smollett at 2 a.m., poured bleach on him, put a noose around his neck, and told him this was “MAGA country.”

The police can’t seem to find any surveillance footage of the attack but released some photos of two men who were in the area about 30 minutes before. Right.

I’m not sure about this. Is Chicago MAGA country? Does anyone wear a MAGA hat outside a political event with security? I’ve never seen anyone just walking around with a MAGA hat in Costco or the movie theater. Do you notice that many of these hate crimes occur in liberal cities filled with liberals? Do white criminals wander the streets of Chicago with a bottle of bleach and a noose looking for gay, black people to assault? Do MAGA people watch “Empire”? Are they able to identify the stars of that show? I don’t know, I don’t know.

Police say two people approached Smollett about 2 a.m. Tuesday as he was walking in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street and got his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett is black and openly gay. Smollett was hit and an unknown chemical substance was poured on him, according to police. A rope was wrapped around Smollett’s neck before the attackers fled the scene, police said. Smollett also told police during a follow-up interview that they said to him: “This is MAGA country,’’ during the alleged attack.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Mariah Carey, one of the world’s most celebrated artists, is performing in Saudi Arabia on Thursday for the first time, but there’s a growing chorus of Saudi women calling on her to cancel the concert to show support for detained women’s rights activists.

Carey is the highest-profile star to perform in the kingdom since it began loosening decades of restrictions on entertainment, music and fun as part of a push by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to overhaul the economy and transform society.

READ MORE: Prisoners shoveled snow in frigid Chicago weather with only orange jumpsuits on

But activists say her concert is an attempt by the government to polish its image after the Oct. 2 killing of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.

It’s a dilemma that other celebrities could face as they ink multimillion dollar deals to perform in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom’s General Entertainment Authority has promised a roster of major performances and sports exhibitions by the world’s biggest names.

Carey’s publicists told The Associated Press in a statement that when “presented with the offer to perform for an international and mixed gender audience in Saudi Arabia, Mariah accepted the opportunity as a positive step towards the dissolution of gender segregation.”

“As the first female international artist to perform in Saudi Arabia, Mariah recognizes the cultural significance of this event and will continue to support global efforts towards equality for all,” the statement said, adding that Carey looks forward to bringing inspiration and encouragement to all audiences.

In December, the kingdom hosted a Formula-E car race in Riyadh, where thousands of young Saudis and hundreds of international visitors partied into the night at concerts by Enrique Iglesias, The Black Eyed Peas and DJ David Guetta.

Omaima Al-Najjar, a Saudi woman who fled the kingdom to seek political refuge abroad, said the concerts are a diversion from the Saudi-led war in Yemen against the neighboring country’s Houthi rebels, human rights abuses committed under the crown prince and repressive male guardianship laws that restrict women’s freedoms.

“The Saudi government is using entertainment to distract the people from human rights abuses because it can sense the anger among the public,” she said.

Al-Najjar is a co-founder of Women for Rights in Saudi Arabia, or WARSA, which launched a petition calling on Carey to boycott the country. The petition aimed to publicly pressure Carey because “she has power to stand for women … as an artist and as a female,” Al-Najjar said.

Activists are tweeting at Carey directly, urging her to take notice of the prominent Saudi women’s rights activists imprisoned since May who had long campaigned for social changes and women’s empowerment. The women, who include activists in their 20s as well as mothers, grandmothers and retired professors, have been accused of vague national security violations in connection to their human rights work.

Al-Najjar said artists like Carey should make their performances in Saudi Arabia conditional on the release of the women’s rights activists. A boycott would not impact ordinary Saudis because many cannot afford the concert’s ticket prices anyway, she said.

Tickets for Carey’s concert start at around $80, and VIP seats — already sold out — cost $530. The average monthly wage for Saudis is around $2,600, according to the General Authority for Statistics.

Alia al-Hathloul called on Mariah Carey to remember her sister, Loujain al-Hathloul, who she says has been abused and threatened with death while in detention because of her activism, which included defying the kingdom’s ban on women driving before it was lifted last year.

“Remember, thanks to my sister @LoujainHathloul, you r able to perform in Saudi Arabia. I wish she can attend your concert. But she’s locked behind bars because she tried to improve women’s condition. Don’ forget to thank her on stage,” she wrote to Carey on Twitter.

Saudi female artist Ms Saffaa wrote on Twitter: “Will @Mari

ahCarey be singing ‘It’s a long road when u face the world alone. No one reaches out a hand 4 u 2 hold’ to imprisoned female #Saudi activists @LoujainHathloul, @Saudiwoman, & @azizayousef?”

Both women, as well as Al-Najjar, made their pleas from abroad, where they do not face the prospect of arrest for speaking out.

Carey is to perform at King Abdullah Economic City, a two-hour drive north of Islam’s holiest site of Mecca. The Economic City, built as a sort-of enclave for foreigners and Saudis, is gated and can only be entered with permission from security.

The concert, which includes DJ Tiesto, has also drawn the ire of some ultraconservatives on Twitter, angered that it is taking place in the greater region of Mecca.

The General Entertainment Authority’s online flyer for Carey’s concert shows her only from the waist up, with a red scarf draped over her arms. Women in Saudi Arabia are required to wear loose, long black robes known as abayas in public. Most Saudi women also cover their hair and face.

Still, a concert like this would have been unthinkable until recently. Religious police used to enforce strict gender segregation, scolded women for not covering their hair and barged into restaurants to demand music be turned off.

The changes have a powerful backer in the crown prince, who is seeking to boost domestic spending and draw attention to his reforms.

Efforts to brand him a reformer took a hit after Saudi agents close to the crown prince killed and dismembered Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who was critical of the prince’s crackdown on dissent. The U.S. Senate and U.S. intelligence have blamed the crown prince for the killing, but Saudi Arabia insists he had no involvement.

Thursday night’s concert is taking place at the Saudi International golf tournament. The European Tour has drawn several of golf’s biggest stars, including four of the top five players in the world.

The purse is $3.5 million, though the primary income for these players is appearance money, likely to be in the $1 million range for the biggest names.

The golfing champions signed up to play for the European Tour event last April, well before Saudi agents killed Khashoggi. Even so, at least one big-name player pulled back. UNICEF ambassador Paul Casey has also said he’d “sit this one out.”

In reading about the racist and homophobic attack on 36-year-old actor Jussie Smollett, I was plunged into deep sadness. I stand in spiritual solidarity with Jussie – I cannot be at his bedside tonight. Instead, I’ve picked up my pen.

Historically, we (Black people) have been subject to unspeakable violence. Last summer, I visited The Legacy Museum and National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama created by the Equal Justice Initiative. At this chilling memorial, I learned about how many who looked like me were murdered, publicly. They were lynched – a noose was tied around their neck and they were hanged, while onlookers simply watched.

A chemical, possibly bleach, was poured on Jussie and a rope was tied around his neck. Jussie was the victim of a hate crime and domestic terrorism. Unlike others, Jussie survived and was able to report what happened to him.

Today, the public lynchings continue. The killings by police of Michael Brown, Saheed Vassell, and Charleena Lyles are evidence of this. Lyles, a Black woman who lived in Seattle, was pregnant when she was murdered.

With these facts, my womanism is intrinsically different from white feminism. My experience as a Black woman makes me increasingly vulnerable to experiencing this level of violence. Indeed, anti-blackness is so insidious that Black children are murdered at startling rates. And note, transgender Black women are also unsafe in their communities.

Jussie is an actor, son, American citizen, and Black man who has been dragged to hell. This happened to Jussie because anti-blackness and homophobia is promulgated by the current political rhetoric.

I keep thinking about the healing, therapy, and care Jussie will need to rebuild himself physically, spiritually and emotionally. His family and friends must be fraught with concern, and managing their shock. They must wonder if he will return to the Jussie they knew before all of this happened.

Jussie’s attack is a reminder of the extensive harm that white supremacy does to us, individually and collectively. This harm exists in constructs such as the gentrification-to-prison-pipeline, climate injustice, barriers to housing, transphobia, and the criminalization of the poor. We cannot analyze any one of these constructs in isolation. It’s all connected.

As a member of the NYC Million Hoodies Movement for Justice Alumni network, I ask that we not only stand in solidarity with Jussie and his family, but we demand an end to the hateful rhetoric that served as a precursor to this heinous crime. I ask that you hold Jussie in your thoughts and send healing energy to him wherever you are on the planet.

I ask that you not only denounce this homophobic and racist act within the confines of social media, but in meeting spaces, social arenas, work settings, churches and grocery stores. If you’re a in a position of power or a decision-maker be sure to openly and unequivocally denounce any indication of racism and homophobia in your stream of vision and/or consciousness. Focus on cultivating spaces that center women of color, transgender Black women, and individuals with disabilities.

Understand that no one is free unless those pushed to the lower echelons of society are free.

Our complacency and silence will not support Jussie. Our tendency to take the position of the “caring bystander” is insufficient. America’s enduring loyalty to white supremacy is destructive.

We need to stop watching and start acting, now.

Allegedly, Smollett was jumped by two white men in ski masks after he left a Subway restaurant. The two men beat Smollett, placed a rope around his neck and doused him in bleach. The Empire star took himself to the hospital, where he was treated for a fractured rib and released. Now, TMZ is reporting that Smollett's neighbor saw a suspicious man hours before the attack.

The media site spoke to the woman, who asked to remain anonymous. She claims that she saw a man that looked like a ""redneck"" loitering outside her and Smollett's building. She left the building at 12:30 AM on Tuesday to take her dogs for a walk and saw the man near the door, pacing between the parking garage and entrance. Allegedly, the man was looking agitated and smoking a cigarette. She claims that, ""He looked out of place."" She further described him as a white man with scruff wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood, and blue jeans that were too short, exposing ""thick, grey hunting socks"" with beige dress shoes. The neighbor claims she saw what looked like a rope, or a clothesline, handing from the bottom of his sweatshirt. It is possible that this man is one of the ""persons of interest"" that investigators are currently looking into."

The hype surrounding Carnival Cruise Line's Mardi Gras vessel continues apace.

In December MailOnline Travel reported that it would feature the world's first roller coaster on a ship. Now more features have been revealed, along with stunning new renderings.

They show a water park on the top deck (which the roller coaster loops around), an atrium with three-deck-high floor-to-ceiling windows and a 'French Quarter' that's been designed to 'capture the spirit of New Orleans'.

Carnival Cruise Line has released new renderings of its Mardi Gras vessel. Pictured is the Ultimate Playground zone - home to a water park and the first roller coaster at sea

Florida-based Carnival says that the ship, which it describes as its most innovative yet, will feature six themed zones across 20 decks, with a spectacular atrium serving as the focal point.

This is where the aforementioned huge ceilings will be located.

The zone here will be called Grand Central and it will also be the home of the first-ever dedicated Punchliner Comedy Club, where guests can enjoy nightly shows.

The French Quarter zone will be lined with bars, music and restaurants that capture the spirit of the Big Easy.

It will be linked to a two-deck-high promenade leading to a traditional New Orleans jazz club with live entertainment and 'refreshing hand-crafted drinks'.

At La Piazza on the middle of deck eight, Mardi Gras will honour Italy with authentic cuisine from two Mediterranean-themed restaurants and a bar.

In the Summer Landing zone, there will be a Guy's Pig & Anchor Smokehouse Brewhouse restaurant serving smoked barbecue favourites and craft beers.

Outside, there will be a pool and whirlpools as well as ample spaces for lounging and hanging out, said Carnival.

A lido on deck 16 and 17, meanwhile, will have a number of varied poolside restaurants, similar to those on other Carnival ships, with more new concepts set to be announced at a later date.

Construction on Mardi Gras, an XL-class ship, will start in 2020. It will be the first in North America to be powered by liquefied natural gas

The water park will be on the 'Ultimate Playground' on the top two decks.

Other Carnival ships have aqua parks but the firm says that this will be the largest and most elaborate in the fleet.

The Ultimate Playground is also where guests will find the Bolt: Ultimate Sea Coaster, the first roller coaster at sea announced last month, where riders race along an 800-foot-long track achieving speeds of nearly 40 miles per hour.

Mardi Gras will also incorporate features that are already popular on the rest of Carnival's fleet such as Alchemy Bar, Fahrenheit 555 Steakhouse, and the Serenity adult-only retreat.

Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line, said: 'When our guests choose fun and book a vacation on Mardi Gras, they are going to find many firsts and exciting experiences, all enhanced by the fun atmosphere our great Carnival crew deliver on every cruise.

'We've specifically designed Mardi Gras to invite everyone to create their own personalized fun vacation experience with options to suit every age, mood or taste.'

Construction on Mardi Gras, an XL-class ship, will start in 2020.

It will be the first in North America to be powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG).

It will be delivered in 2022 to mark the 50th anniversary of Carnival Cruise Line and will be based at Port Canaveral in Florida."

By Travis M. Andrews , Travis M. Andrews Pop culture reporter covering music, movies, TV, comedy and celebrity culture Email Bio Follow Bethonie Butler and Bethonie Butler Reporter covering television and pop culture Email Bio Follow Allyson Chiu Allyson Chiu Reporter Email Bio Follow January 30 at 10:12 PM Chicago police are asking the public for help in locating two “people of interest” caught on surveillance footage just before the alleged assault against Jussie Smollett, a black, openly gay actor best known for his work in Fox’s “Empire.”

Police released images showing two figures, both wearing what appear to be dark jackets, walking along a snowy street between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. local time on Tuesday, nearby where Smollett, 35, alleged he was attacked less than an hour later. Smollett reported that he was assaulted by two people carrying a noose and an unidentified “chemical substance” in what police are calling a “possible racially charged assault and battery.”

“While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,” Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday.

This image provided by the Chicago Police Department and taken from surveillance video shows two people of interest in an attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago, early Tuesday, Jan. 29, 2019. (Courtesy of Chicago Police Department via AP) Smollett was walking in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street about 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday “when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department said in a statement to The Washington Post. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.”

The police could not confirm the gender of the offenders or identify the chemical substance.

“At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victims neck,” the statement said.

Eventually the offenders fled, and Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Hospital “and is in good condition.”

TMZ reported that Smollett was discharged Tuesday morning. The hospital could not confirm this detail but told The Post that Smollett was not currently a patient.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said.

Smollett told detectives his attackers said “something to the effect of ‘this is MAGA country,’” an apparent reference to President Trump’s enduring “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, during the assault. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the initial police report did not reference those comments, but the actor recalled the information in a follow-up interview with detectives.

Guglielmi said Smollett still had a thin, white rope around his neck when officers first made contact with him around 2:40 a.m., roughly 40 minutes after the alleged assault. He also confirmed that the FBI is investigating a threatening letter that was sent to Smollett on Jan. 22 at the Fox studio in Chicago.

The FBI has not yet responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post.

Fox released a statement Tuesday in support of the actor. “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate — and especially against one of our own.”

Smollett’s publicist did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Smollett began his career as a child actor with his siblings, who include actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. He is best known for playing Jamal Lyon on “Empire.” The character is a gay R&B musician who has faced homophobic criticism from his mogul father.

The character struggled with his sexuality before coming out in a buzzed-about Season 1 episode. The plot development led to widespread speculation about Smollett’s sexuality. A month later, Smollett appeared on the TV show “Ellen,” when he confirmed he is gay.

“It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet, there’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he told TV host Ellen DeGeneres. “I don’t have a closet. But I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home. So that’s why I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is, without a doubt, no closet I’ve ever been in. And I just wanted to make that clear.”

He more directly addressed his sexuality in a 2016 interview with Out magazine. Though Smollett said he was open to falling in love with anyone, he identifies as a gay man.

“I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I don’t know how many times I have to say that,” he told the magazine.

As news of his attack spread Tuesday, Smollett received statements of support from LGBTQ advocacy organizations he has worked with over the years.

“Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,” GLAAD said in a statement.

“This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident,” said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities — and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities.”

Last year, the FBI said there was a 17 percent increase in hate crimes in 2017 — the third consecutive year such crimes increased. Of the 7,175 hate crimes reported by United States law enforcement agencies, 2,013 incidents targeted black Americans. 1,130 hate crimes involved people who were targeted based on their sexual orientation.

Messages of support from fans and fellow celebrities for Smollett poured out on Twitter as the news unfolded.

Terrence Howard, the star of “Empire,” appeared on “Good Morning America” Wednesday morning, where he said Smollett was improving, though it was difficult.

“I heard he’s getting better. You know, he’s angry,” Howard said. “But I know Jussie. Jussie’s anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won’t, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.”

Howard also praised Smollett, saying, “Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood. He’s the one that cheers everybody up. “

“Empire” co-star Vivica A. Fox tweeted in all caps: “IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!! SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE! PRAYERS UP TO U NEPHEW!”

I'm just now hearing the news about the senseless hate attack on my #EMPiRE Nephew @JussieSmollett IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!! SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE! PRAYERS UP TO U NEPHEW! 😢😢🙇🏾‍♀️🙇🏾‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/p4GqfNW3An

— Vivica A. Fox (@MsVivicaFox) January 29, 2019 Lee Daniels, who co-created “Empire” with Danny Strong, posted a heartfelt and expletive-laden video on Instagram .

“It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this, because Jussie, you are my son,” Daniels said. “You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck . . . You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are. Because it shows we are united on a united front.”

Strong, meanwhile, wrote that he is “deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks.”

Smollett “is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,” Strong tweeted . “Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.”

…whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie’s talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.

— Danny Strong (@Dannystrong) January 29, 2019 “We ALL have a responsibility to rise up against the ignorance and hate out there. If you know who did this . . . REPORT THEM TO THE POLICE,” tweeted “Scandal” creator Shonda Rhimes.

“Grey’s Anatomy” actress Caterina Scorsone sent “love and healing” to the actor: “We must tirelessly teach our children about the dignity and sacredness of each and every human being so that this kind of insanity ends. Hate destroys us from within. Teach them to love. It’s on us.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) both weighed in on Twitter, calling the assault a “modern-day lynching.”

“No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin,” tweeted Harris. “We must confront this hate.”

The 35-year-old singer and actor was hospitalised after a savage attack in which a noose was put around his neck and bleach was poured on him, with the assailants shouting 'This is MAGA country' in a racially-motivated attack.

The homophobic and racist hate crime sparked anger all over America, with celebrities tweeting their support for the actor. Kevin Hart sent the actor prayers through his social media accounts, with the 39-year-old tweeting;

Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why… https://t.co/G6vCnKPEhf — (@KevinHart4real) January 30, 2019

""Sending prayers your way Jussie Smollett ….This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world?""

""Why are we falling in love with hate? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother,"" he concluded.

The tweet sparked yet more backlash online, following the controversy which lead to him stepping down from hosting the 2019 Oscars. A series of homophobic tweets were uncovered from the past, featuring jokes about beating up a gay son.

One social media user responded: ""Do you see why the “jokes” weren’t funny now?”, while another replied with one of Kevin’s polarising past tweets reading:

‘”Yo if my son comes home and tries to play with my daughters doll house I’m going to break it over his head and say 'stop that’s gay.'”

Podcaster and writer Ira Madison quote-tweeted Kevin’s tweet about Jussie and wrote: ""Your funniest joke congrats."" This was the final straw for Hart, who responded with a tweet of his own.

I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person. Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do…CHANGE! https://t.co/Ybbo8OYKTt — (@KevinHart4real) January 30, 2019

Ira replied, saying;

""I 'harp' because my community of black queer people face violence 365 days in America and when we tried to tell you that we weren’t trolling you but wanted to educate how your jokes lead to actions like what happened to Jussie, you went on Ellen to talk about your wheelchair movie.""

Fans of Kevin Hart chose to defend him, saying that he has shown remorse for his past actions and praising him for his support of Jussie.

Hart refused to host the Oscars after the controversy, and Ellen DeGeneres gave him a platform to speak about his past homophobic actions.

The Chicago Police Department have just released CCTV images of two persons of interest in the Smollett case. Nine days ago, he was sent a letter in the post to Fox Studios which read: ‘You will die black f*ggot"".

He has received negative attention from racist and homophobic people in America as a result of his role in Empire, where he portrays a rising gay, black singer in the music industry."

Chicago: Black, openly-gay actor Jussie Smollett of the US television program ""Empire"" was hospitalised Tuesday in Chicago following a possibly hate-motivated attack in which assailants tied a rope around his neck, police and his co-workers said.



News of the early morning attack left the entertainment world reeling and gay advocacy groups speaking out in support of the 36-year-old actor.



Smollett was beaten at around 2:00 am by two attackers who yelled ""racial and homophobic slurs"" while he walked downtown in the third-biggest US city, said police, who did not name him but said the victim was an actor from ""Empire.""



Smollett's fellow cast members and production company identified him as the victim.

The attackers poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, and then wrapped a rope around the actor's neck, according to police.""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" the Chicago Police Department said.The actor and singer was reportedly in Chicago for a scheduled Saturday concert.Senator Kamala Harris of California, who on the weekend launched her 2020 campaign to be America's first black female president, called the incident ""an attempted modern day lynching.""""No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate,"" Harris said on Twitter.Members of the ""Empire"" production team and cast, as well as the studio that produces the program, also spoke out.""The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate -- and especially against one of our own,"" 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.The show's co-creator Lee Daniels posted an Instagram video calling Jussie ""my son.""""You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,"" Daniels said, addressing the actor.""Hold your head up Jussie.

The 35-year old was targeted in a clear hate crime this week by two black-clad, masked men in Chicago’s Streeterville section near his home; they broke his rib, tied a rope around his neck and poured bleach all over him.

Smollett was treated at Northwestern Hospital and remains in stable condition.

He told authorities that the men screamed something about ""MAGA country"" during the assault, a reference to Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.

Now, the cops have released a statement to accompany a couple photos they took off surveillance videos in the area.

The photos depict two men walking on New Street near the intersection with E. Illinois Street between 1:30 AM and 1:45 AM on Tuesday.

They're approximately a block from the Subway restaurant Smollet had gone to Tuesday morning, roughly halfway between the restaurant and Jussie's home.

""Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,” Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday night.

“While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.""

The images here are not very clear, of course.

They were snapped from a distance and the suspects are not looking at the camera.

Still, however, it's a break in the case and technology can be used to enhance the images.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" the Chicago police said in a statement after the alleged attack.

""Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.""

Smollet's manager, Brandon Z. Moore, told police he was on the phone with Jussie during the alleged attack.

He told cops that he clearly heard the MAGA remark, as well as other racial and homophobic slurs. (Smollett gave out as gay in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres in 2015.)

Smollett himself has not yet commented in public about the incident.

However, we know he received a death threat in the mail eight days before the attack.

Guglielmi previously said police had widened their search of surveillance cameras in the area surrounding the site of the alleged attack.

He has described what authorities believe transpired as follows:

The victim goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men.

They were masked and wearing black clothing.

They called him an Empire … and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.

Guglielmi added that the actor returned to his apartment afterward and called his manager, who quickly made his way to Smollett’s home before taking him to the hospital.

“The manager goes to the apartment, and they agree to call police. The manager called us at 2:40 a.m.,” Guglielmi added.

In the wake of this tragic event, many people in Hollywood have sent their best wishes to Smollett, while condemning racism and homophobia in the country.

Kevin Hart got slammed for doing so.

Two co-stars have now spoken out as well.

""Jussie's anger will dissipate, and he will forgive these people for what they did,"" Terrence Howard says. ""But he won't, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.""

He added:

""Jussie's the one that starts singing when everybody's in a bad mood. He's the one that cheers everybody up. He's the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping....

""Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap.

""They were all in shock that our family—you know, the Fox family, the Empire family, the Lyon family—you know, were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today.""

And then there's this from Taraji P. Henson, who plays Smollet's mother on Empire:

I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now. @jussiesmollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!!

I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him.

The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.

The love so many have him just goes to show HE IS LOVE!!!! I LOVE YOU MY BABY MY BABY!!!

Maxine Waters has blamed President Donald Trump for the alleged attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett.

Speaking to news site The Giro, the California congresswoman insisted the president was ‘separating and dividing, and he’s basically emboldening those folks who feel this way.’

It comes after the 35-year-old actor, who came out as gay to Ellen in 2015, said he was set upon by two men in ski masks at 2am on Tuesday in Chicago.

Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters has blamed President Donald Trump for the alleged attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett

He claims the pair assaulted him, hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, doused him with an ‘unknown chemical substance’ previously reported as bleach and put a thin rope around his neck.

Waters, who is a family friend of Smollett’s, explained: ‘Why all of a sudden do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have picnic while black, and being attacked?

‘It’s coming from the president of the United States. He’s dog whistling every day.’

Waters added that she was pleased the actor was ‘doing okay’ and praised his work in the community.

The 35-year-old was attacked at 2am on Tuesday in Chicago by two men in ski masks. He is pictured talking on FaceTime with Lee Daniels

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, dated from January 18, stating that 'You will die black f*g'

Smollett's representative, Brandon Z. Moore, recently revealed he was on the phone with the actor when the alleged attack happened and claims to have heard the men yell 'this is MAGA country'.

Chicago police have also released images of two 'persons of interest' who were captured on surveillance footage on the night the actor was supposedly attacked.

The release of the photos comes just hours after officers said they were unable to find any footage that showed two men attacking the actor.

Detectives reviewed CCTV clips of Smollett walking to his apartment building and ‘for the most part’ they can confirm the route he took when he says he was accosted by the assailants.

The release of the photos comes just hours after officers said they were unable to find any footage that showed two men attacking the actor

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

However, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi noted there were gaps and none of the footage police had reviewed showed the alleged attack.

Smollett suffered a fractured rib and is said to have put up a fight when he was reportedly beaten. A noose was still around his neck at 2.42am when police arrived to the scene.

The actor then took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he was treated then released on Tuesday.

It was previously reported that just a week before the alleged attack, Fox offered the singer and actor based in Chicago, an entourage of body guards for protection after the show's studio received a threatening, homophobic letter addressed to Smollett.

Smollett suffered a fractured rib and is said to have put up a fight when he was reportedly beaten

But Smollett declined around-the-clock security because he found it intrusive, according to TMZ.

The letter threatening Smollett was sent to the Fox studio on January 22 and was laced with a powdery substance believed to be Tylenol, ABC reported.

The FBI is now trying to determine if there's a link between the homophobic letter and the Tuesday attack.

Chuck Hodes/FOX(CHICAGO) — Chicago police have located surveillance video showing potential persons of interest in an alleged attack on Empire actor and singer Jussie Smollett.

Investigators are looking to question the men seen in the video, which was found Wednesday, Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi announced on Twitter.

Police-provided stills from the video show two people walking in the general area of where Smollett was at the time of the alleged attack, which police are calling a “potential racially-charged hate crime.” The video doesn’t show the assault, Guglielmi said.

Chicago police on Wednesday also issued a community alert with details of the alleged attack, and asking that anyone with information contact them.

Smollett, who’s gay, says he was attacked in Chicago by two unknown assailants whom he says hurled racial and homophobic epithets at him, threw an unknown liquid on him and put a rope around his neck. He also said the assailants told him he was in “MAGA country.”

Also Wednesday, Smollett’s music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, confirmed to ABC News that he was on the phone with Smollett at the time of the alleged attack and heard some of what transpired, including someone using the words “MAGA country.” A Chicago PD spokesperson confirms that Moore shared his account with them, and that they are attempting to confirm via cell records that he and Smollett were on the phone at the time. They also say Smollett said he was on the phone with Moore at the time.

A Chicago Police Department spokesperson told ABC News early Wednesday, “As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront, hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders. Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect’s vehicle to be able to share.”

The police spokesperson added: “We are taking this investigation very seriously and detective teams will broaden our search area and work around the clock to look for video on traffic cameras, CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] buses and neighboring thoroughfares which could have captured the offender’s movements.”

“The victim in this case is cooperating fully with detectives and our investigation continues,” the spokesperson said.

Police are now investigating the attack on 35-year-old Jussie - who plays Jamal Lyon in the show - in Chicago on Tuesday as a hate crime after racist thugs in ski masks put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him in a brutal street attack.

The neighbour told TMZ about one of the men she saw saying: ""He looked out of place.""

She told the site she had walked out of her building at 12.30am on Tuesday to take her dogs out and she saw the man near the door, pacing between the parking garage looking agitated and smoking a cigarette.

She described him as a white man with scruff on his face wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt and blue jeans that were too short exposing ""thick, grey hunting socks"".

The latest report comes as it was revealed Jussie turned down extra security days before the attack after a racist and homophobic letter was sent to the set.

The show wanted around the clock protection after he received the vile mail.

Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon spent the first minute or so of his interview with former SNL pal Kenan Thompson dispensing a backlog of congratulations. New babies, an Emmy (for the 90s R&B jam “Come Back Barack,” alongside Chance the Rapper and Chris Redd), a new animated movie, Wonder Park (he’s a beaver, alongside Ken Jeong), finally joining Instagram (two posts, 5, 000 followers at air time), the Fallon-aided potential of a Good Burger 2 reunion with child star co-star Kel Mitchell (which might actually happen), and the recent reunion of the now-grown former teammates of the Mighty Ducks team/movie franchise.



“Speaking of,” interrupted Kenan, “We should send some love to Jussie Smollett,” referencing the violent, racist, gay-bashing attack that left the Empire star hospitalized on Tuesday. “’Cause he is a Mighty Duck,” said Thompson, reminding people of Smollett’s place in the kids movie hockey trilogy. Using Fallon’s “bigger platform” than Kenan’s 5, 000 (now 16,000 by press time) Instagram followers to send out some love and support for the actor and LGBTQ rights activist, Kenan also urged people to send some love “to the universe, because this kind of madness needs to stop.” And, yes, to all you Ducks fanatics out there, while it is true that Smollett’s Mighty Ducks character Terry Hall never shared the ice with Kenan’s Mighty Ducks 2 and 3 character and knuckle-puck virtuoso Russ Tyler, you don’t fuck with a Duck. (As the movies’ tagline almost certainly was not.)

Circling back to a former co-star he most definitely did share many screens with, Kenan told Fallon how, as young Nickelodeon superstars, he and Mitchell were once gifted a pair of coveted Super Bowl tickets—not that they ever saw the game. Noting that he’s actually planning to attend this year’s game taking place in his home town of Atlanta, Thompson revealed that the cash-strapped young pair got dropped off at the gate in San Diego, found out the exorbitant prices people were willing to pay, got paid, and then “went to Chili’s and balled out.” So, if you were lucky enough to be at the San Diego Chili’s near the stadium on January 25, 1998, it was, as Kenan said, “chicken fingers for everyone.”"

The 36-year-old had faced 16 counts of disorderly conduct for making allegedly false claims that two white men attacked him in a Chicago suburb in the early hours of 29 January. Smollett told police that the pair had shouted Trump slogans and racist and homophobic abuse.

Two Nigerian-American brothers known to Smollett later came forward claiming that the Empire star had paid them to stage the attack, reportedly as part of a plan to increase his salary.

However, Cook County prosecutors announced last month that they had decided to drop all charges against Smollett, in what the Associated Press termed an “astonishing reversal”. The case has been sealed, meaning the full story behind the decision is unlikely ever to come to light.

“Two days later, the city’s Department of Law sent Smollett a bill in the amount of $130,106.15, and gave him one week to pay up,” Variety reports.

That deadline expired yesterday without any response - prompting the city’s legal counsel to start work on a civil suit against the celebrity.

“Mr Smollett has refused to reimburse the city of Chicago for the cost of police overtime spent investigating his false police report,” said a spokesperson for the city’s corporation.

“The Law Department will file the suit in the near future. As part of this legal action, the Law Department will pursue the full measure of damages allowed under the ordinance.”

The news that Smollett would not face prosecution for allegedly faking the attack was met with shock and anger from both city authorities and law enforcement.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel blasted the decision as a “whitewash of justice”, while the city’s police Superintendent Eddie Johnson insisted that Smollett had perpetrated a “hoax”.

Smollett has strenuously maintained his innocence. Speaking in court last month after the charges against were dropped, he stressed that he had been “truthful and consistent on every single level since day one”.

In a statement following the hearing, his attorneys said their client’s record “has been wiped clean”, claiming he was a “victim who was vilified”.

But Joe Magats, the assistant state’s attorney, stressed that the decision to drop the case was “not an exoneration”.

“To say that he was exonerated by us or anyone is not true,” Magats said. “We believe he did what he was charged with doing.”

Along with the costs lawsuit, Smollett may also be facing further legal troubles.

As more information about the alleged hate-crime investigation began circulating on Wednesday evening, it showed that once again journalists, politicians and celebrities might have run too hard and too soon with another unfounded allegation. Much like in ""The Truth About The Lincoln Memorial Incident,"" accurate reporting can come only with time, but that didn't stop media figureheads from lambasting all Trump-supporters, again. Smollett, an actor on a television show, Empire, claimed he was attacked during the early hours on Monday by two people he could not give descriptions of, not even as to their sex. He claimed they hurled racial and homophobic insults as they assaulted him and then proceeded to pour an ""unknown liquid"" on him before wrapping a thin rope around his neck.

Smollett then told police he went to his friend's apartment with the rope still around his neck and continued to wear it until police were dispatched 45 minutes later. Upon their arrival, Smollett asked them to turn off their body camera recordings. During the initial interview, no mention was made indicating that the attackers were Trump-supporters but TMZ ran the headline ""Attackers Shouted 'MAGA Country'"" anyway. When police were asked to verify this, they could not, and so they followed up with Smollett, where he then stated that the perpetrators did yell the confusing sentiment. Before waiting for more information, Kamala Harris, who had an established relationship with the actor, and Cory Booker took to Twitter, where they both offered support to the actor as well as phrasing his attack as a ""modern-day lynching."" Many accused the two senators of using the incident to promote their anti-lynching legislation despite the fact that no lynching occurred, even if all of Smollett's accusations are true. More celebrities joined in, and articles began circulating that it was a ""racially charged hate crime"" even though the sexes and races of the perpetrators were not known to police or Smollett. Wednesday evening, the AP released a statement from the Chicago police that said, ""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" a reference to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him. This was after law enforcement reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance recordings from dozens of businesses in the area where Smollett claimed that the attack happened. A city with almost 20,000 public cameras, indicative of an Orwellian dystopia, had captured no physical evidence that a crime had occurred. Police later Wednesday night released two photos of ""persons of interest"" but did not imply that they were suspects of the attack. The grainy images showed a pair walking down a street with no distinguishing features or holding any objects, nor was Smollett in the frames. Chicago police issued the ""community alert"" since the pair in the video stills could not be identified and there had been an implication of a hate crime. They also reiterated that they still had no proof that confirmed Smollett's story. The incident sparked recollection of many alleged hate crimes that too quickly prompted social media cries of racism and anti-Trump rhetoric only to be later proved as hoaxes. Breitbart keeps a running tab of over 100 hate crime hoaxes since President Trump's election. Smollett's suspected attack is eerily similar to one from Massachusetts where a 20-year-old man claimed he was the victim of an assault by two racists who called out ""Trump country now"" during the attack. After police interviewed the ""victim,"" he admitted that he had made the story up to ""raise awareness"" of issues in the country. It is still too early to tell whether Jussie Smollett's claims of victimhood are true, false, or somewhere in the exaggerated middle, but that only means that it was too early for outlets like GQ and TMZ to be running stories that place blame at the feet of the president and his supporters for a crime they can't be sure occurred. There is a natural emotional response to tragic stories, but increasingly, people have been using them to reinforce pigeonholes that they hold on to for completely unrelated reasons – like self-proclaimed activist Alyssa Milano doubling-down on her hate toward the Covington kids, even after video evidence exonerated them, by claiming that ""MAGA hats are the new white hoods of the KKK."" Wrath is the sin that fuels anti-Trumpers' feeling of perverse vindication when they hear that something terrible has happened and it coincides with their own philosophies. Then a complete lack of humility is present when it turns out to not be as bad as they first thought or even hoped. Stepping on someone else's sad story as a soapbox to virtue-signal is distasteful. To do so without even confirming the story's authenticity is ignorance. Being unable to re-evaluate when the story is proven false is dangerous. Connect with Taylor Day on Twitter at @TABYTCHI."

PUSHBACK AGAINST 'INFANTICIDE' ALLEGATIONS - Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam is pushing back against Republican accusations that he supports infanticide following backlash over his comments on a controversial new state abortion bill ... ""Republicans in Virginia and across the country are trying to play politics with women's health, and that is exactly why these decisions belong between a woman and her physician -- not legislators, most of whom are men,"" Northam spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement.

Northam appeared on a Washington radio station to discuss the Repeal Act, which seeks to repeal restrictions on third-trimester abortions. Virginia Democratic Del. Kathy Tran, one of the sponsors, sparked outrage from conservatives when she confirmed at a hearing that a woman about to give birth could still request an abortion under the new bill. When asked about Tran's comments, Northam, a former pediatric neurologist, said that third-trimester abortions are done in extreme cases where a fetus may be severely deformed or ""not viable' with the consent of the mother and often multiple physicians.

“So in this particular example if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen,"" he said. ""The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.”

The intent of Northam's comments was not clear. But some conservative commentators and lawmakers believed he was discussing the possibility of letting a newborn die and was possibly endorsing ""infanticide.""

The proposed legislation in Virginia follows New York passing a bill last week loosening restrictions on abortion. New Mexico, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington state also have passed new laws expanding abortion access or moved to strip old laws from the books that limit abortions.

TRUMP INTERVENTION 101: President Trump on Wednesday called chief intelligence officials ""naive"" and suggested they ""go back to school"" after they told Congress that North Korea is unlikely to dismantle its nuclear arsenal and that the Iran nuclear deal is working. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called on the director of national intelligence and the FBI chief to intervene and tutor the president ... Schumer, D-N.Y., called on Dan Coats, director of national intelligence, to stage an intervention with Trump after the president took the unusual move Wednesday of criticizing Coats, CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Christopher Wray after their Tuesday appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

""President Trump's criticism of the testimony you and other intelligence leaders provided to Congress yesterday was extraordinarily inappropriate,"" Schumer wrote to Coats, adding later that ""I believe it is incumbent on you, Director Wray and Director Haspel ... to impress upon him how critically important it is for him to join you and the leadership of our Intelligence Community in speaking with a unified and accurate voice about national security threats.""

BIPARTISAN COMMITTEE REMAINS DIVIDED OVER THE WALL: A bipartisan committee of House and Senate lawmakers met for the first time Wednesday, aiming to work out a deal on border security and avoid another government shutdown in a few weeks. But it was clear that Democrats and Republicans remain very divided over President Trump's long-promised border wall ... Both sides expressed optimism they could reach a deal that would stop the government from shutting down again Feb. 15. However, Democrats dismissed President Trump's call for a physical border wall and argued that smart border security technology would be more effective and cost-efficient. Republicans argued that a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border is needed in some places and that smart technology alone does not stop anyone from crossing into the U.S. illegally.

POLAR VORTEX TURNS DEADLY: A University of Iowa student has died after being found unresponsive on campus grounds early Wednesday as a polar vortex gripped the Midwest in arctic temperatures that have been linked to at least seven other deaths ... Campus police found Gerald Belz, 18, was found behind an academic building on the Iowa City campus just before 3 a.m., KCRG-TV reported. Police haven’t released a cause of death, but believe the frigid temperatures played a role, FOX28 Cedar Rapids reported. Meanwhile, an 82-year-old Illinois man was found dead outside several hours after he fell trying to get into his home, the Peoria Journal Star reported. His cause of death was recorded as related to cold exposure.

In Indiana, a 22-year-old police officer and his wife were killed in a crash on an icy road, South Bend station WBND-TV reported. Ligonier police Officer Ethan Kiser's SUV spun into the path of another SUV, killing the couple and the driver of the other vehicle, 21-year-old Shawna Kiser, officials told the station. Other deaths included a man struck and killed by a snow plow in the Chicago area and a Milwaukee man found frozen to death in a garage.

ATTACK ON ‘EMPIRE’ ACTOR PROBED: Chicago police released photos of ""people of interest"" Wednesday night in connection with the attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett ... Smollett, 36, told investigators he was brutally attacked early Tuesday by two unknown men who yelled out ""racial and homophobic slurs.""

Police said earlier Wednesday that they reviewed hundreds of hours of footage from downtown surveillance cameras, but had yet to find footage of the attack. But hours later the Chicago P.D.'s chief communications officer, Anthony Guglielmi, released on Twitter two photos of those possibly connected to the beating. The photos appear to show two people, dressed in dark clothing, walking along a sidewalk next to a building.

According to authorities they were captured on surveillance footage and are now wanted for questioning.

They reportedly hit the Empire star in the face, tied a noose around his neck, and “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him.

Smollett told law enforcement that the attackers yelled “MAGA country.” The case is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Naija News reports that Smollett has been enjoying massive support from fans and other celebrities since the attack occurred.

9:45 AM PT -- Police confirm to TMZ they have video of Jussie with rope draped around his neck as he walks through the lobby of his building. That video was captured by a building surveillance camera.

A woman who lives in Jussie Smollett's apartment building told cops she saw a suspicious man -- whom she said looked like a ""redneck"" -- loitering just outside the entrance to the building an hour and a half before Jussie says he was attacked.

The woman -- who asked us not to use her name -- tells TMZ, she walked out of the building at 12:30 AM Tuesday to take her dogs out and saw the man near the door, pacing between the parking garage and entrance, looking agitated and smoking a cigarette. She says, ""He looked out of place."" He was a white man with scruff on his face wearing a blue winter beanie, a blue zip-up sweatshirt with a hood and blue jeans that were too short, exposing ""thick, grey hunting socks"" with camel-colored dress shoes.

She says she noticed what looked like a rope, or a clothesline, protruding from the bottom of his sweatshirt, made of white and blue material.

She says he was staring at another man about 300 feet away, who was standing near another entrance to the building.

She says she got ""creeped out"" by the man, and after 5 minutes she retreated back into the building.

The woman says she went to sleep and woke up at 4 AM to go to the gym, and noticed a lot of security. She says the concierge told her Jussie was attacked, and when she told him what she saw, the concierge implored her to call a detective and gave her two phone numbers. She made contact that afternoon and downloaded a detective.

As we reported, cops have released photos of 2 persons of interest. We do not know if one of them is the person the woman saw.

Chicago PD sources tell us they have looked at numerous videos in the area in question, but have not seen any footage of an altercation."

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was not seriously hurt in the Tuesday incident, which police were treating as a possible hate crime.

CHICAGO – Chicago police said on Wednesday they would soon release images of “persons of interest” in the assault of Empire actor Jussie Smollett in which two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs and wrapped a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was not seriously hurt in the Tuesday incident, which police were treating as a possible hate crime.

The images came from a surveillance camera near the attack, Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi tweeted.

The two men approached Smollett on the street in the early hours of Tuesday, yelling racial and homophobic slurs, then hit him in the face, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

A representative for Smollett did not respond to requests for comment.

Empire, a hip-hop musical drama series, from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, premiered on television in 2015. Its lead actress, Taraji P. Henson, won a Golden Globe Award in 2016 for her role and the show has received multiple Emmy Award nominations.

I had the idea to write about NBA Pride last Wednesday, when the Brooklyn Nets hosted Emmy Award-winning choreographer Travis Wall at their third annual Pride Night. The evening tied into New York’s yearlong celebration and remembrance of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots — a seminal moment in the gay pride movement.

It was one of many similar events hosted throughout the league, as the NBA slowly adopts a more vocal stance on gay pride. Most importantly, it looked like a hell of a lot of fun, at least from the eyes of Wall, who posted approximately 30 Instagram stories documenting his excitement from the sidelines, tossing T-shirts into the crowd and cheering on players whose names he didn’t even know.

That’s what I wanted to write about this week — the joy of seeing one of the top two leagues in American professional sports create a special event specifically to lift up and embrace the queer community. It was supposed to be a fun, happy column about love, grace and acceptance.

But then, news broke yesterday of the hospitalization of “Empire” star Jussie Smollett. Early Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked by two men in Chicago. He was beaten and throttled around the neck with a rope. His attackers poured bleach on his bare skin while calling him a “n——” and a “faggot.”

There aren’t words to describe the feeling that gripped my gut as I read that news report the first time, the second time, the third and fourth and fifth. I wanted to puke. I wanted to scream. I wanted to cry. That’s the weird thing about homophobia — it makes you feel as if you’re split in two. It makes you want to curl into yourself and lash out, to go back into the closet and to pin rainbow patches to every single item you own. It makes you wish you weren’t gay. It makes you wish that everyone was gay.

Mostly, it reminds you that you’re different, you’re part of the “other” and that people hate you for your otherness. Still. Fifty years after Stonewall, four years after Obergefell v. Hodges. That hate burns on.

As a white, straight-passing woman, I know that there’s privilege in the extent of my fear. I know that I can hide behind my sorority sweatshirts and avoid the type of surface-level violence — both emotional and physical — that assaults queer-presenting people of color on a daily basis. I’m privileged because my sexuality is a non-issue with my friends and family, and because I’ve never been at physical risk due to my appearance.

My experiences with the isolation and shame of homophobia are a watered-down version of what many others face. And I’m aware that the attack on Smollett had as much to do with the color of his skin, that it was an intersectional hatred that led these two men to commit this crime. But this attack makes clear why it is vital for sports leagues to continue to advocate for the queer community.

Many people like to tell us that the gay rights movement is over, that things are better now, that there’s no more fighting to be done. That’s a lie. Just because we earned our marriage rights doesn’t mean that we aren’t at risk, that we aren’t struggling for our lives on a daily basis. Children are still sent to conversion camps. Trans people still can’t serve their country in the military. Queer people of every shape, size and color are still beaten and left to die.

The gay pride movement is not over. We have to fight like hell everywhere and that includes in sports. Some might say that a Pride Night is a political motion, or simply a public relations stunt. It’s neither of those things. More than any organized religion, sport is the most powerful faith in America. It is worshipped and cherished in every state, in every city. It is our common language. It defines how many of us see ourselves. And when teams take the time to lift up the queer community, to celebrate us, to love us, they slowly teach our country how to do the same.

It is beautiful that owners in the MLS, NHL and NBA understand this truth (I pray that soon the NFL will follow, although I recognize that might be a far-off pipe dream). Perhaps they don’t see the full depth, or see it only as a politically correct gesture. That doesn’t matter to me. Each Pride Night, from here on out, will help build a safer future for the queer community — a future where we will accept as fact that love is love and that people are people, all deserving of respect and safety, no matter their color or sexuality.

Deadly Arctic blast threatens Midwest, spreads East

The Midwest's Arctic misery spreads to New York on Thursday as bitter cold air throws more of the country into a life-threatening deep-freeze. Temperatures in the Big Apple are expected to fall to the lower single digits, but that's practically balmy compared to Minneapolis or Chicago. On Thursday, the Illinois city may approach its all-time record low of 27 degrees below zero, with the wind chill making it feel much colder. Wednesday's real-feel temperature in the truly Windy City was 51 below zero. At least eight deaths have been linked to the frigid weather.

Furloughed federal workers finally getting paid

Most of the 800,000 federal workers furloughed in the partial government shutdown should receive their back pay by Thursday. Margaret Weichert of the Office of Management and Budget tweeted the news earlier this week, adding that workers ""are getting paid in record time."" President Donald Trump signed the deal Friday to end the 35-day shutdown — the longest on record — for three weeks. In the meantime, lawmakers and the White House will negotiate over Trump's demand for funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Employees missed two paychecks during the shutdown, some having to take out loans or seek help from creditors as a result.

El Chapo's lawyers give closing arguments

Jurors in the trial of Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán hear his lawyers' arguments Thursday for acquitting the accused Mexican drug kingpin. Guzman faces life in prison on charges including selling drugs, laundering money and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. In closing arguments on Wednesday, federal prosecutor Andrea Goldbarg said the government presented a ""mountain of evidence"" in the 11-week trial. On the table beside her lay exhibits including an assault rifle, camouflage body armor and bricks of cocaine allegedly seized from cartel shipments. The jury, serving anonymously for security reasons, may start deliberations Friday.

Smollett released from hospital; 'Empire' scheduled to resume filming

Filming for Fox's ""Empire"" is expected to resume Thursday just days after actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago. According to Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi, Smollett, 36, says he was approached by two people who ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" adding that they punched him in the face, poured a chemical on him and wrapped a rope around his neck. On Wednesday, Chicago Police released several images of ""potential persons of interest"" in what Guglielmi calls a ""possible hate crime."" After the attack, Smollett went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital to have the cuts on his face and neck treated. He was described as being in good condition and ""recovering well,"" his representative, Pamela Sharp, told USA TODAY.

Get your popcorn ready! Billy Crystal will make his NBA (broadcasting) debut

Sure, he's played an NBA referee in ""Forget Paris"" but Billy Crystal's next role will be a completely new experience Thursday. The Hollywood legend joins longtime Los Angeles Clippers play-by-play man Ralph Lawler to call the game against the Lakers at Staples Center. Crystal, who has been a Clippers season-ticket holder since 1985 and their most recognizable fan, approached the team last year with the special request. Lawler is retiring at the end of the season after 40 years as the voice of the Clippers, and Crystal is one of many notable names joining him on broadcasts to pay tribute. ""Ralph is a fantastic broadcaster and a wonderful man,"" Crystal told the Clippers’ team site. ""I'm looking forward to calling a game with him. He's a Hall of Famer in my book."""

Kevin Hart has defended himself against the backlash sparked by his tweet of support to Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

Jussie, 35, was hospitalised after a brutal attack in which a noose was put around his neck and bleach was thrown on him, with police confirming that the assault was a possible homophobic and racist hate crime.

In the wake of the attack, Kevin, 39, sent the actor prayers, writing on Instagram and Twitter: ‘Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett ….This is unbelievably sad. Why are we going backwards….this is disgusting. We as people have to do better. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate????

However, Kevin’s tweet didn’t go down too well, following the controversy surrounding homophobic tweets of his being unearthed – leading to the comedian stepping down as Oscars host.

One tweet responded: ‘Do you see why the “jokes” weren’t funny now??”, while another person replied with one of Kevin’s past tweets reading: ‘”Yo if my son comes home & try’s 2 play with my daughters doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay.'”

Podcaster and writer Ira Madison quote-tweeted Kevin’s tweet about Jussie and wrote: ‘Your funniest joke congrats’ – leading to Hart hitting back.

The Upside star responded: ‘I stand with a man in his time of hurt and need by giving him heart felt support and u take the time to harp on my 10yr past that I have apologized about and moved on from by being a better person. Do you want change? If so I am an example of what u want people to do…CHANGE!’

Ira replied: ‘I “harp” because my community of black queer people face violence 365 in America and when we tried to tell you that we weren’t trolling you but wanted to educate how your jokes lead to actions like what happened to Jussie, you went on Ellen to talk about your wheelchair movie.’

Fans of Hart defended him, praising him for making a change and standing with Jussie.

The Chicago Police Department has released CCTV images of two possible persons of interest in the Smollett case.

Jussie told police the attackers yelled ‘MAGA country’, denoting the phrase ‘Make America Great Again’.

Nine days ago, Jussie was sent a letter in the post to Fox Studios which read: ‘You will die black f**.’

*Bennett College is on the verge of collapse if the HBCU doesn’t raise $5 million by February 1 in order to receive accreditation and remain open.

“The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges voted in December to end Bennett’s accreditation, citing major budget deficits over the years. (The school had already been on probation for two years). Now the institution is tasked with coming up with $5 million dollars before a Feb. 1 deadline. If they don’t meet the fiscal goal, Bennett will close,” NBC News reported.

As noted by MadameNoire, the private, four-year institution for women in Greensboro, North Carolina was founded in 1873, and like many HBCU’s, its been having financial issues for several years.

“The only thing we can do between now and Feb. 1 is to impact our financial resources and we need about $5 million — at least $5 million — to stabilize the institution,” Bennett College President Dr. Phyllis Dawkins told Fox 8 News. “Between Dec. 11 to the present, we’ve raised almost a half million dollars in that short period of time.”

According to Dawkins, Bennett College has received help from organizations such as The National Council of Negro Women, Inc., Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., The United Negro College Fund, The United Methodist Church and The Women’s Coalition.

“Bennett has been an anchor in Greensboro, North Carolina and has graduated many, many outstanding African American women in this country and abroad,” said Bennett alum and former City Councilwoman Marian B. Tasco.

Celebrities have also been vocal in their support on social media. “Empire” star Jussie Smollett recently Tweeted: “In the 1930s we had 121 #HBCUs now we’re at 101. Don’t let us be down to 100 if #BennettCollege, who has made the education of black women a priority since 1926, closes its doors. The legacy must continue.

This is not the first time the school has faced financial trouble.

“The college was on probation from 2001 to 2003 after a 30 percent decline in enrollment and a budget deficit of $3.8 million,” reported the Greensborough News and Record. The probation was lifted after then-president Johnetta Cole raised $15 million in 18 months, according to NBC.

Meanwhile, Bennett College posted this update on Twitter Jan. 29: “We are now 38% away from reaching our goal! THANK YOU SO MUCH! We truly appreciate those who #StandWithBennett and donated!

Smollett said he was attacked in the early morning hours on Tuesday in a Chicago neighborhood known as Streeterville by two people who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” and “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him, according to police.

Smollett reported that one of his attackers also put a rope around his neck, police said. Police found video showing Smollett entering into his building with what appears to be a rope tied around his neck, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CNN.

“It was being worn like a neck tie but shaped like a noose,” Guglielmi said.

Both Smollett and his music manager told the police they were on the phone with each other during the alleged attack, Guglielmi told CNN.

“We have not been able to independently verify this because cell phone records would not be produced; We have no reason to doubt those statements, but we needed to independently verify those statements because of their financial relation,” Guglielmi said.

Smollett told police both attackers fled the scene.

Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital and was in “good condition” in the hours following, authorities said.

CNN’s Don Lemon spoke to Smollett and a mutual friend who was at the hospital with the actor. Smollett confirmed the incident took place.

He was shaken and angry that an attack like this could happen. Smollett told CNN he fought back at the attackers.

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” police said in a statement Tuesday.

Investigators are testing the chemical Smollett said he was doused with and have yet to confirm the nature of the substance.

Detectives had canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video as of late Tuesday and expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders.

A dozen police detectives, with the assistance of the FBI, are working the case, the spokesperson said.

Smollett has starred on Fox’s “Empire” since 2015. He plays Jamal, a successful singer in the musical Lyon family. Like his character, Smollett identifies as gay.

In the aftermath of Smollett’s assault, his friends, colleagues and peers showed an outpouring of support for the actor, who is an active advocate for the LGBTQ community."

Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon in Empire, came out as gay during an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2015.

LOS ANGELES: 'Empire' star Jussie Smollett was attacked on Tuesday morning while leaving a restaurant in what Chicago police are calling a possible hate crime.

The 36-year-old actor was exiting a restaurant in Chicago when two men started shouting racial and homophobic slurs towards him before attacking Smollett, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

They punched him, poured an unknown chemical substance over him and one of the suspects even wrapped a rope around the actor's neck.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" police said in a statement to THR.

The police said the suspects were two males in black clothing. One of them was wearing a black mask.

Smollett, who was hospitalised for his injuries, told the police that the attackers yelled pro-""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) comments during the attack, such a ""MAGA country!"" On the show, Smollett plays musician Jamal Lyon, the son of Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie (Taraji P Henson).

The character is gay so is the actor in real life.

Chicago - Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday. Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted: Investigators ""for the most part"" can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn't find a container anywhere,"" Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press Wednesday night that the actor ""is at home and recovering.""

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.""

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says congressional negotiations over border security are a “waste of time,” while insisting he has “set the stage” to take action on his own if lawmakers don’t provide funding for his border wall.

Trump tells The New York Times in an interview published Thursday night that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “is hurting our country very badly by doing what’s she doing and, ultimately, I think I’ve set the table very nicely.”

Trump adds: “I’ll continue to build the wall, and we’ll get the wall finished. Now whether or not I declare a national emergency — that you’ll see.”

Trump has threatened to declare a national emergency to get the wall built, but such a move would be challenged in court, tying up the money indefinitely.

WINTER WEATHER-THE LATEST

The Latest: At least 3 deaths in New York blamed on storm

CHICAGO (AP) — At least three deaths in western New York are being blamed on the winter storm that has dropped more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of snow and inflicted subzero wind chills.

Authorities said Thursday that a homeless man found frozen in a suburban Buffalo bus shelter may have been a fourth storm victim but an autopsy was needed to confirm his cause of death.

Two Buffalo-area men died clearing snow and a man died in Livingston County when his vehicle hit a snowdrift and crashed early Thursday.

The victims’ names and other details haven’t been released.

Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz says one of the men who died clearing snow was shoveling and the other was operating a snowblower.

Buffalo schools will be closed for a third day Friday.

UNITED STATES-RUSSIA-ARMS TREATY

US expected to announce treaty pullout as early as Friday

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is expected to announce as soon as Friday that it will withdraw from an arms treaty that has been a centerpiece of superpower arms control since the waning days of the Cold War.

Some analysts worry that the treaty’s demise could fuel a new arms race.

An American withdrawal, which has been expected for months, follows years of unresolved dispute over Russian compliance with the pact, signed in 1987 and known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty.

It is the first arms control measure to ban an entire class of weapons — ground-launched cruise missiles with a range between 500 kilometers (310 miles) and 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles).

The U.S. asserts that Russia has deployed a missile in violation of the treaty. Russia denies this.

TRUMP-PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

Trump plan would channel prescription discounts to patients

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration says it is moving ahead with a plan to channel behind-the-scenes prescription drug discounts directly to consumers.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Thursday his proposed regulation would encourage drugmakers, middlemen and insurers to provide any such discounts to consumers when they purchase their prescriptions.

Drugmakers don’t provide discounts for all their medications, so the impact for consumers remains to be seen.

The proposal would work by doing away with an exemption from federal anti-kickback rules that now allows drugmakers, insurers and middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate rebates among themselves.

It would be replaced with a new exemption for discounts offered directly to consumers.

The Nogales CBP Port Director Michael Humphries said Thursday that the drug was seized Saturday from a tractor-trailer carrying produce from Mexico after it was stopped for inspection at the border crossing.

Agents also seized an additional 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) of fentanyl pills and a large cache of methamphetamine.

The Mexican man driving the truck was arrested.

The Latest: Pence praises DEA help in convict Maduro allies

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The United States strongly rejects offers from Mexico, Uruguay and the Vatican to mediate a dialogue between embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the head of the country’s opposition-controlled congress, Juan Guaido.

A senior U.S. administration official explicitly mentioned the three in a briefing Thursday and added that “we reject any talks of any type of efforts that would allow Maduro to maintain himself in power.”

The official repeated the U.S. government’s position that Maduro is no longer the president of the country. Canada and many Latin American nations also have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president, arguing that Maduro’s re-election last May was invalid because his strongest opponents were barred from running.

The U.S. official briefed reporters on the condition of not being quoted by name.

Mexico and Uruguay announced Wednesday that they will hold an international conference Feb. 7 to discuss the Venezuela crisis. Both countries have not recognized Guaido as president.

Trump said, “I hope she does a good job. I respect her.” Trump said his speech next Tuesday will be sweeping “but part of it’s going to be unity.”

Abrams will be the first black woman to deliver a Democratic response. Democrats chose her in part because she represents the future of the party and the black women who anchor it.

TOO MUCH TOOTHPASTE

Study: Many small kids are using too much toothpaste

NEW YORK (AP) — A new study suggests too many young kids are using too much toothpaste, increasing their risk of streaky or splotchy teeth when they get older.

About 40 percent of kids ages 3 to 6 used a brush that was full or half-full of toothpaste. Experts recommend no more than a pea-sized amount.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention findings were based on a survey of parents of more than 5,000 kids ages 3 to 15.

Fluoride prevents cavities. Health officials recommend that all people drink fluoridated water, and that everyone 2 or older brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.

Past studies have suggested fluorosis has been increasing for at least three decades, and can affect as many as 2 out of 5 adolescents.

EMPIRE CAST MEMBER-ATTACK-THE LATEST

The Latest: Family says attack on actor was hate crime

CHICAGO (AP) — The family of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett says that they have no doubt that the actor is a victim of a “racial and homophobic hate crime.”

In a statement released via one of Smollett’s representatives, the family seems to dispute any suggestion that Smollett wasn’t truthful with police when he reported that two men in masks beat him early Tuesday, hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, threw an undetermined chemical on him and looped a rope around his neck. The family says Smollett has told police “everything” and that his account of what happened has “never changed.”

Such doubts have been expressed online as police have reported that they have not yet located any surveillance video of the attack and that Smollett declined to turn over phone records that would show he was talking to his agent on the phone at the time of the attack, as he told detectives. Police have said that Smollett has been cooperative.

Police continued to gather and analyze surveillance video Thursday and reported that video from Smollett’s apartment building shows that he had a thin rope around his neck when he arrived after he says he was beaten up.

FACEBOOK-APPLE BAN-THE LATEST

The Latest: Apple axes Google access to key developer tool

NEW YORK (AP) — Google says Apple has also revoked its access to a key developer tool, preventing its employees from testing new app features on iPhones. Facebook lost access to the same tool Wednesday, but had it restored Thursday.

Google appears confident it would quickly regain its access. It says it is working with Apple to fix what it called a temporary disruption to some of its corporate iPhone apps, and said it expected the situation to be resolved soon.

Google declined to say why it lost access to the tool. The action came a day after the company voluntarily withdrew a market-research app called “Screenwise Meter,” which Google had distributed to users outside the App Store — although not to teens.

Apple did not reply immediately to a request for comment.

Trump, Pelosi stances on wall suggest deal will be difficult

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared Thursday that there’ll be no “wall money” in any compromise border security deal as she and President Donald Trump signaled that congressional negotiators may never satisfy his demands for his cherished Southwest border proposal.

Trump, who in recent weeks has expressed indifference to whether the term “wall” or something else is used, clung with renewed tenacity to the word that became his campaign mantra, declaring, “A wall is a wall.” Yet in a series of tweets and statements, he issued conflicting messages about what he’d need to declare victory and suggested that merely repairing existing structures along the boundary could be a major component of a triumph.

Amid signs that Trump’s leverage in Congress is atrophying, he seemed to aim one tweet at his conservative followers. He wrote that Democrats “are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I’ve got you covered. Wall is already being built, I don’t expect much help!”

Pelosi, D-Calif., left the door open for an accord that could finance some barriers, citing what she said was already existing “Normandy fencing” that blocks vehicles.

“If the president wants to call that a wall, he can call that a wall,” she told reporters. She added: “Is there a place for enhanced fencing? Normandy fencing would work.”

Long johns to short sleeves: Rapid thaw follows polar blast

CHICAGO (AP) — In Illinois, temperatures could rise by 80 degrees within days. In Michigan, melting snow and rain and a 17-mile ice jam could lead to flooding. Across the Midwest, the sudden warmth was sure to bring more broken roads and busted water mains.

The polar vortex that brought many cities to a standstill was expected to end with a rapid thaw that experts say could be unprecedented. But the sudden swing from long johns to light jackets and short sleeves could create problems of its own.

“I don’t think there’s ever been a case where we’ve seen (such a big) shift in temperatures,” in the winter, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the Weather Underground firm. “Past record-cold waves have not dissipated this quickly. … Here we are going right into spring-like temperatures.”

On Thursday, the system marched east, spreading arctic conditions over an area from Buffalo to Brooklyn. In western New York, a storm that dumped up to 20 inches of snow (51 centimeters) gave way to subzero temperatures and face-stinging wind chills. In New York City, about 200 firefighters battling a blaze in a commercial building took turns getting warm on buses. The number of deaths that could be blamed on the cold climbed to at least 15.

For the nation’s midsection, relief was as close as the weekend.

US expected to announce treaty withdrawal as soon as Friday

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is poised to announce Friday that it is withdrawing from a treaty that has been a centerpiece of superpower arms control since the Cold War and whose demise some analysts worry could fuel a new arms race.

An American withdrawal, which has been expected for months, would follow years of unresolved dispute over Russian compliance with the pact, known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty. It was the first arms control measure to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched cruise missiles with a range between 500 kilometers (310 miles) and 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles). Russia denies that it has been in violation.

U.S. officials also have expressed worry that China, which is not party to the 1987 treaty, is gaining a significant military advantage in Asia by deploying large numbers of missiles with ranges beyond the treaty’s limit. Leaving the INF treaty would allow the Trump administration to counter the Chinese, but it’s unclear how it would do that.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in early December that Washington would give Moscow 60 days to return to compliance before it gave formal notice of withdrawal, with actual withdrawal taking place six months later. The 60-day deadline expires on Saturday, and the administration is expected to say as early as Friday that efforts to work out a compliance deal have failed and that it would suspend its compliance with the treaty’s terms.

The State Department said Pompeo would make a public statement on Friday morning, but it did not mention the topic.

Trump plan would channel prescription discounts to patients

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration Thursday unveiled a plan to channel now-hidden prescription drug rebates directly to patients, saying it would bypass middlemen and lower prices for consumers.

The proposed regulation from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar would eliminate behind-the-scenes discounts among drugmakers, insurers and go-betweens and instead require that they be paid directly to consumers when they buy their medications.

The idea is to do away with a hidden cost seen as contributing to artificially high list prices for prescription drugs. The proposal was co-authored with the Health and Human Services inspector general’s office.

The plan comes as President Donald Trump is under political pressure to deliver results on his repeated promises to slash prescription drug costs. Democrats in Congress want to empower Medicare to directly negotiate prices with drug companies, but Republicans prefer a market-based approach that keeps the government out of setting prices.

The impact for consumers would not be immediate, since the changes would take effect over the next year if all goes according to plan. Also, drugmakers do not currently provide discounts for all their medications.

US border agency says it’s made biggest-ever fentanyl bust

PHOENIX (AP) — U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials announced Thursday their biggest fentanyl bust ever, saying they captured nearly 254 pounds (114 kilograms) of the synthetic drug that is fueling a national epidemic of fatal opioid overdoses from a secret compartment inside a load of Mexican produce heading into Arizona.

The drug was found hidden Saturday morning in a compartment under the rear floor of a tractor-trailer after a scan during a secondary inspection indicated “some anomalies” in the load, and the agency’s police dog team alerted officers to the presence of drugs, Nogales CBP Port Director Michael Humphries said.

Most of the seized fentanyl with an overall street value of about $3.5 million was in white powder form, but about 2 pounds of it (1 kilogram) was contained in pills. Agents also seized nearly 395 pounds (179 kilograms) of methamphetamine with a street value of $1.18 million, Humphries said.

“The size of a few grains of salt of fentanyl, which is a dangerous opioid, can kill a person very quickly,” Humphries said. The seizure, he said, had prevented an immeasurable number of doses of the drug “that could have harmed so many families.”

President Donald Trump praised the bust in a tweet Thursday, writing: “Our great U.S. Border Patrol Agents made the biggest Fentanyl bust in our Country’s history. Thanks, as always, for a job well done!”

Venezuela opposition leader to police: Leave my family alone

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The Venezuelan opposition leader challenging Nicolas Maduro’s claim to the presidency warned officers from a feared state security unit Thursday to stay away from his family after he accused them of showing up at his apartment in a tense brush with the very force he is trying to persuade to switch allegiance and back him.

A visibly flustered but determined Juan Guaido told a crowd gathered at a university that members of a special police unit known for its brutal tactics had gone to his high-rise apartment in a middle-class neighborhood of Caracas while his 20-month-old daughter was inside.

“I hold you responsible for anything that might happen to my baby,” the 35-year-old lawmaker said as his wife stood beside him.

He rushed home and emerged an hour later holding his smiling daughter, named for Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan patriot who paved the way for Venezuela’s independence, and described how four agents from the police’s Special Action Force had arrived at the building and asked security guards stationed there for his wife.

“Children are sacred,” he admonished the agents as a crowd of supporters applauded. “Wives are sacred. So don’t cross that red line.”

Trump says State of Union address to stress ‘unity’

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that “unity” will be the theme of his first State of the Union address under divided government and that he respects Stacey Abrams, who will give the Democratic response.

“I hope she does a good job. I respect her,” Trump said of Abrams, who will be the first black woman to deliver the rebuttal.

Trump will give his speech Tuesday before a joint session of Congress at a sensitive time in talks over keeping the government open and funding the border wall he is demanding as part of any deal. Members of Congress are inviting federal workers worried about another shutdown after Feb. 15. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election meddling also hovers.

Trump will also be surrounded by living reminders of the changes wrought by the 2018 midterm elections that ushered Democrats into the House majority.

Sitting behind him: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who maneuvered the president into retreating last week on his demand for a border wall in exchange for an end to the longest government shutdown in history.

Study: Many small kids in US are using too much toothpaste

NEW YORK (AP) — Too many young kids are using too much toothpaste, increasing their risk of streaky or splotchy teeth when they get older, according to a government survey released Thursday.

About 40 percent of kids ages 3 to 6 used a brush that was full or half-full of toothpaste, even though experts recommend no more than a pea-sized amount, the study found.

Health officials recommend that all people drink fluoridated water, and that everyone 2 or older brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.

But the amount is important. Children under 3 are only supposed to use a smear of toothpaste the size of a grain of rice. Kids 3 to 6 are supposed to keep it to a pea-sized amount.

‘Empire’ actor’s family calls for justice in Chicago attack

CHICAGO (AP) — Jussie Smollett’s family said Thursday that the attack on the black and gay “Empire” actor in downtown Chicago this week was a “hate crime” and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, hasn’t spoken publicly about the early Tuesday attack, though his representative said Wednesday that Smollett was recovering at home. Smollett’s family issued a statement through a spokesman Thursday saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked “racial and homophobic hate crime” and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

They thanked the public “for their prayers” and said the family is “so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.”

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said. “Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.”

Facebook says Apple is restoring a key developer tool

NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook says Apple is restoring its access to a key development tool that the iPhone maker disabled Wednesday.

Late Tuesday, TechCrunch reported that Facebook paid teens and other users who agreed to download an app called Facebook Research. That app could extensively track their phone and web use. Apple said Facebook was abusing the tool , known as a developer enterprise certificate, to distribute the app on iPhones in a way that allowed the social network to sidestep Apple restrictions on data collection.

By revoking the certificate for the iOS software that powers the iPhone and iPad, Apple closed off Facebook’s efforts to sidestep Apple’s app store and its tighter rules on privacy.

Apple did not immediately respond to a message for comment Thursday afternoon. Facebook did not say whether it agreed to any conditions for the certificate restoration.

In an internal memo sent on Wednesday, Facebook told employees it is “working closely” with Apple to reinstate access. It also told workers to install the public versions of apps from the app store. Apps that it said “may not work” included internal versions of Facebook, Workplace, Instagram and the Ride app, which helps workers with transportation. WhatsApp was not affected.

Trump warned of Afghan pullout risks

WASHINGTON (AP) — Trump administration claims of progress in talks with the Taliban have sparked fears even among the president’s allies that his impatience with the war in Afghanistan will lead him to withdraw troops too soon, leaving the country at risk of returning to the same volatile condition that prompted the invasion in the first place.

Discussions between a U.S. envoy and the Taliban are advancing weeks after the administration said it wanted to begin drawing down troops in Afghanistan. That has prompted some critics to note that President Donald Trump is telegraphing a withdrawal — the same thing he accused President Barack Obama of doing by saying he wanted to end the American combat mission in 2014.

“It’s an effort to put lipstick on what will be a U.S. withdrawal,” said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul under Obama.

A negotiated settlement to America’s longest war poses a dilemma for Trump. He has often declared he wants to end lengthy overseas military entanglements, something he made clear in December by declaring the Islamic State group defeated in Syria and announcing he was pulling 2,000 American troops from that country over the objections of his top foreign policy advisers.

The stakes are higher in Afghanistan, a conflict that has cost 2,400 American lives and hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars. The U.S. invaded the country to oust the Taliban and al-Qaida in October 2001 in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the CIA director warned as recently as Tuesday that Afghanistan could once again become a terrorist haven.

Polar blast envelops Midwest, strains aging infrastructure

CHICAGO (AP) — A blast of polar air enveloped much of the Midwest on Wednesday, cracking train rails, breaking water pipes and straining electrical systems with some of the lowest temperatures in a generation.

The deep freeze closed schools and businesses and cancelled flights in the nation’s third-largest city, which was as cold as the Arctic. Heavily dressed repair crews hustled to keep utilities from failing.

Chicago dropped to a low of around minus 23 (minus 30 Celsius), slightly above the city’s lowest-ever reading of minus 27 (minus 32 Celsius) from January 1985. Milwaukee had similar conditions. Minneapolis recorded minus 27 (minus 32 Celsius). Sioux Falls, South Dakota, saw minus 25 (minus 31 Celsius).

Wind chills reportedly made it feel like minus 50 (minus 45 Celsius) or worse. Downtown Chicago streets were largely deserted after most offices told employees to stay home. Trains and buses operated with few passengers. The hardiest commuters ventured out only after covering nearly every square inch of flesh against the extreme chill, which froze ice crystals on eyelashes and eyebrows in minutes.

The Postal Service took the rare step of suspending mail delivery in many places, and in southeastern Minnesota, even the snowplows were idled by the weather.

AP NewsBreak: ICE force-feeding detainees on hunger strike

Federal immigration officials are force-feeding six immigrants through plastic nasal tubes during a hunger strike that’s gone on for a month inside a Texas detention facility, The Associated Press has learned.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says 11 detainees at the El Paso Processing Center have been refusing food, some for more than 30 days. Detainees who reached the AP, along with a relative and an attorney representing hunger strikers, said nearly 30 detainees from India and Cuba have been refusing to eat, and some are now so weak they cannot stand up or talk.

Another four detainees are on hunger strikes in the agency’s Miami, Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco areas of responsibility, said ICE spokeswoman Leticia Zamarripa on Wednesday.

The men say they stopped eating to protest verbal abuse and threats of deportation from guards. They are also upset about lengthy lock ups while awaiting legal proceedings.

In mid-January, two weeks after they stopped eating, a federal judge authorized force-feeding of some El Paso detainees, Zamarripa said. She did not immediately address the detainees’ allegations of abuse but did say the El Paso Processing Center would follow the federal standards for care.

US: Mueller evidence used in disinformation campaign

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal prosecutors say confidential material from the Russia investigation was altered and released online as part of a disinformation campaign to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, according to a court filing Wednesday.

The material had been handed over to defence attorneys for Concord Management and Consulting LLC, a Russian company that Mueller has charged with financing efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

But the files, which prosecutors say were not sensitive, surfaced online last year in a link posted by a pro-Russian Twitter account.

The prosecutors stopped short of accusing Concord of leaking the material, but they argue that the company’s request to have sensitive new evidence sent to Russia “unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.”

Concord is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as “Putin’s chef” for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been hit with U.S. sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 election and is charged alongside his company in the indictment brought by Mueller.

Dems see future in Abrams as she prepares to rebut Trump

ATLANTA (AP) — Stacey Abrams will be doing more than rebutting President Donald Trump next week. As the first black woman to deliver a Democratic response to a State of the Union address, she’ll represent what many in the party see as their political future.

In picking Abrams, the Georgian who narrowly lost her bid to be the nation’s first African-American woman governor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is reflecting the party’s hope to win future elections with appeals to women and people of colour. He’s also signalling the party’s desire to make inroads in the diversifying South and Sun Belt after disappointing losses there during last year’s midterms.

Abrams, 45, represents the growing political clout of black women. That’s something Schumer wants to tap into by recruiting her to compete in next year’s Georgia Senate race, a decision that could have national implications for Democrats if she successfully flips the seat and, in the process, turns out enough voters to make the Deep South state competitive at the presidential level.

Schumer and others “understand the power and prowess and contributions of black women … and choosing Stacey Abrams is the physical embodiment of that recognition,” said Democratic strategist Symone Sanders.

The speech offers Abrams a high-profile launching pad to a Senate campaign. Though she hasn’t decided whether she’ll run, Schumer has spent the past several weeks courting Abrams to challenge first-term Republican Sen. David Perdue. She has also met with Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, chairwoman of Senate Democrats’ 2020 campaign efforts, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Kamala Harris, a presidential contender who is currently the lone black woman in the Senate.

Opposition protesters fill streets of Venezuelan capital

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuelans of every age, class and profession poured into the streets of the capital on Wednesday to demand that President Nicolas Maduro step down and to express their support for the young opposition leader who has declared himself interim president.

Dressed in suits, scrubs, and jeans, they waved the national flag, displayed signs, and chanted slogans. One disgusted vendor threw devalued national currency into the air.

Protesters who made an appearance were heeding a call from opposition leader Juan Guaido to stage mass demonstrations despite crackdowns on previous protests.

Here are some scenes from across Caracas:

Rand Paul awarded more than $580K after neighbour’s attack

U.S. Sen. Rand Paul was awarded more than $580,000 in damages and medical expenses on Wednesday in his lawsuit against the neighbour who tackled him and broke several of his ribs in a dispute over lawn maintenance.

A jury in Bowling Green, Kentucky, deliberated less than two hours before delivering the award to the Republican lawmaker who had been attacked while doing yard work at his Kentucky home.

Paul had testified during the three-day trial that he feared for his life as he struggled to breathe after Rene Boucher, an anesthesiologist by trade, slammed into him in their upscale Bowling Green neighbourhood in late 2017.

The jury awarded $375,000 in punitive damages and $200,000 for pain and suffering, plus $7,834 for medical expenses.

Afterward, Paul said in a statement that he hoped the verdict would send a “clear message that violence is not the answer — anytime, anywhere.”

E-cigs outperform patches and gums in quit-smoking study

WASHINGTON (AP) — A major new study provides the strongest evidence yet that vaping can help smokers quit cigarettes, with e-cigarettes proving nearly twice as effective as nicotine gums and patches.

The British research, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, could influence what doctors tell their patients and shape the debate in the U.S., where the Food and Drug Administration has come under pressure to more tightly regulate the burgeoning industry amid a surge in teenage vaping.

“We know that patients are asking about e-cigarettes and many doctors haven’t been sure what to say,” said Dr. Nancy Rigotti, a tobacco treatment specialist at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study. “I think they now have more evidence to endorse e-cigarettes.”

At the same time, Rigotti and other experts cautioned that no vaping products have been approved in the U.S. to help smokers quit.

Smoking is the No. 1 cause of preventable death worldwide, blamed for nearly 6 million deaths a year. Quitting is notoriously difficult, even with decades-old nicotine aids and newer prescription drugs. More than 55 per cent of U.S. smokers try to quit each year, and only about 7 per cent succeed, according to government figures.

Parole recommended for Manson follower Leslie Van Houten

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A California panel on Wednesday recommended that Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten be paroled after serving more than four decades in prison.

After a hearing at the women’s prison in Corona, California, commissioners of the Board of Parole Hearings found for the third time that the 69-year-old Van Houten was suitable for release.

If her case withstands a 150-day review process, it will rest in the hands of California’s new Gov. Gavin Newsom. Van Houten was recommended for parole twice previously, but then-Gov. Jerry Brown blocked her release.

Van Houten was among the followers in Manson’s murderous cult who stabbed to death wealthy grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in 1969. Van Houten was 19 during the killings, which came a day after other Manson followers killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others in Los Angeles.

Tate’s sister attended Wednesday’s proceedings and said afterward that she vehemently disagrees with the parole recommendation.

Police release photos of “persons of interest” in attack

CHICAGO (AP) — Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

The prosecutors stopped short of accusing Concord of leaking the material, but they argue that the company’s request to have sensitive new evidence sent to Russia “unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.”

Concord is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as “Putin’s chef” for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been hit with U.S. sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 election and is charged alongside his company in the indictment brought by Mueller.

Dems see future in Abrams as she prepares to rebut Trump

ATLANTA (AP) — Stacey Abrams will be doing more than rebutting President Donald Trump next week. As the first black woman to deliver a Democratic response to a State of the Union address, she’ll represent what many in the party see as their political future.

In picking Abrams, the Georgian who narrowly lost her bid to be the nation’s first African-American woman governor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is reflecting the party’s hope to win future elections with appeals to women and people of colour. He’s also signalling the party’s desire to make inroads in the diversifying South and Sun Belt after disappointing losses there during last year’s midterms.

Abrams, 45, represents the growing political clout of black women. That’s something Schumer wants to tap into by recruiting her to compete in next year’s Georgia Senate race, a decision that could have national implications for Democrats if she successfully flips the seat and, in the process, turns out enough voters to make the Deep South state competitive at the presidential level.

Schumer and others “understand the power and prowess and contributions of black women … and choosing Stacey Abrams is the physical embodiment of that recognition,” said Democratic strategist Symone Sanders.

The speech offers Abrams a high-profile launching pad to a Senate campaign. Though she hasn’t decided whether she’ll run, Schumer has spent the past several weeks courting Abrams to challenge first-term Republican Sen. David Perdue. She has also met with Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, chairwoman of Senate Democrats’ 2020 campaign efforts, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Kamala Harris, a presidential contender who is currently the lone black woman in the Senate.

Opposition protesters fill streets of Venezuelan capital

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuelans of every age, class and profession poured into the streets of the capital on Wednesday to demand that President Nicolas Maduro step down and to express their support for the young opposition leader who has declared himself interim president.

Dressed in suits, scrubs, and jeans, they waved the national flag, displayed signs, and chanted slogans. One disgusted vendor threw devalued national currency into the air.

Protesters who made an appearance were heeding a call from opposition leader Juan Guaido to stage mass demonstrations despite crackdowns on previous protests.

Rand Paul awarded more than $580K after neighbour’s attack

U.S. Sen. Rand Paul was awarded more than $580,000 in damages and medical expenses on Wednesday in his lawsuit against the neighbour who tackled him and broke several of his ribs in a dispute over lawn maintenance.

A jury in Bowling Green, Kentucky, deliberated less than two hours before delivering the award to the Republican lawmaker who had been attacked while doing yard work at his Kentucky home.

Paul had testified during the three-day trial that he feared for his life as he struggled to breathe after Rene Boucher, an anesthesiologist by trade, slammed into him in their upscale Bowling Green neighbourhood in late 2017.

The jury awarded $375,000 in punitive damages and $200,000 for pain and suffering, plus $7,834 for medical expenses.

Afterward, Paul said in a statement that he hoped the verdict would send a “clear message that violence is not the answer — anytime, anywhere.”

E-cigs outperform patches and gums in quit-smoking study

WASHINGTON (AP) — A major new study provides the strongest evidence yet that vaping can help smokers quit cigarettes, with e-cigarettes proving nearly twice as effective as nicotine gums and patches.

The British research, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, could influence what doctors tell their patients and shape the debate in the U.S., where the Food and Drug Administration has come under pressure to more tightly regulate the burgeoning industry amid a surge in teenage vaping.

“We know that patients are asking about e-cigarettes and many doctors haven’t been sure what to say,” said Dr. Nancy Rigotti, a tobacco treatment specialist at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study. “I think they now have more evidence to endorse e-cigarettes.”

At the same time, Rigotti and other experts cautioned that no vaping products have been approved in the U.S. to help smokers quit.

Smoking is the No. 1 cause of preventable death worldwide, blamed for nearly 6 million deaths a year. Quitting is notoriously difficult, even with decades-old nicotine aids and newer prescription drugs. More than 55 per cent of U.S. smokers try to quit each year, and only about 7 per cent succeed, according to government figures.

Parole recommended for Manson follower Leslie Van Houten

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A California panel on Wednesday recommended that Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten be paroled after serving more than four decades in prison.

After a hearing at the women’s prison in Corona, California, commissioners of the Board of Parole Hearings found for the third time that the 69-year-old Van Houten was suitable for release.

If her case withstands a 150-day review process, it will rest in the hands of California’s new Gov. Gavin Newsom. Van Houten was recommended for parole twice previously, but then-Gov. Jerry Brown blocked her release.

Van Houten was among the followers in Manson’s murderous cult who stabbed to death wealthy grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in 1969. Van Houten was 19 during the killings, which came a day after other Manson followers killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others in Los Angeles.

Tate’s sister attended Wednesday’s proceedings and said afterward that she vehemently disagrees with the parole recommendation.

Police release photos of “persons of interest” in attack

CHICAGO (AP) — Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

Trump warned of Afghan pullout risks

WASHINGTON (AP) — Trump administration claims of progress in talks with the Taliban have sparked fears even among the president’s allies that his impatience with the war in Afghanistan will lead him to withdraw troops too soon, leaving the country at risk of returning to the same volatile condition that prompted the invasion in the first place.

Discussions between a U.S. envoy and the Taliban are advancing weeks after the administration said it wanted to begin drawing down troops in Afghanistan. That has prompted some critics to note that President Donald Trump is telegraphing a withdrawal — the same thing he accused President Barack Obama of doing by saying he wanted to end the American combat mission in 2014.

“It’s an effort to put lipstick on what will be a U.S. withdrawal,” said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul under Obama.

A negotiated settlement to America’s longest war poses a dilemma for Trump. He has often declared he wants to end lengthy overseas military entanglements, something he made clear in December by declaring the Islamic State group defeated in Syria and announcing he was pulling 2,000 American troops from that country over the objections of his top foreign policy advisers.

The stakes are higher in Afghanistan, a conflict that has cost 2,400 American lives and hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars. The U.S. invaded the country to oust the Taliban and al-Qaida in October 2001 in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the CIA director warned as recently as Tuesday that Afghanistan could once again become a terrorist haven.

Polar blast envelops Midwest, strains aging infrastructure

CHICAGO (AP) — A blast of polar air enveloped much of the Midwest on Wednesday, cracking train rails, breaking water pipes and straining electrical systems with some of the lowest temperatures in a generation.

The deep freeze closed schools and businesses and cancelled flights in the nation’s third-largest city, which was as cold as the Arctic. Heavily dressed repair crews hustled to keep utilities from failing.

Chicago dropped to a low of around minus 23 (minus 30 Celsius), slightly above the city’s lowest-ever reading of minus 27 (minus 32 Celsius) from January 1985. Milwaukee had similar conditions. Minneapolis recorded minus 27 (minus 32 Celsius). Sioux Falls, South Dakota, saw minus 25 (minus 31 Celsius).

Wind chills reportedly made it feel like minus 50 (minus 45 Celsius) or worse. Downtown Chicago streets were largely deserted after most offices told employees to stay home. Trains and buses operated with few passengers. The hardiest commuters ventured out only after covering nearly every square inch of flesh against the extreme chill, which froze ice crystals on eyelashes and eyebrows in minutes.

The Postal Service took the rare step of suspending mail delivery in many places, and in southeastern Minnesota, even the snowplows were idled by the weather.

AP NewsBreak: ICE force-feeding detainees on hunger strike

Federal immigration officials are force-feeding six immigrants through plastic nasal tubes during a hunger strike that’s gone on for a month inside a Texas detention facility, The Associated Press has learned.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says 11 detainees at the El Paso Processing Center have been refusing food, some for more than 30 days. Detainees who reached the AP, along with a relative and an attorney representing hunger strikers, said nearly 30 detainees from India and Cuba have been refusing to eat, and some are now so weak they cannot stand up or talk.

Another four detainees are on hunger strikes in the agency’s Miami, Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco areas of responsibility, said ICE spokeswoman Leticia Zamarripa on Wednesday.

The men say they stopped eating to protest verbal abuse and threats of deportation from guards. They are also upset about lengthy lock ups while awaiting legal proceedings.

In mid-January, two weeks after they stopped eating, a federal judge authorized force-feeding of some El Paso detainees, Zamarripa said. She did not immediately address the detainees’ allegations of abuse but did say the El Paso Processing Center would follow the federal standards for care.

US: Mueller evidence used in disinformation campaign

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal prosecutors say confidential material from the Russia investigation was altered and released online as part of a disinformation campaign to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, according to a court filing Wednesday.

The material had been handed over to defence attorneys for Concord Management and Consulting LLC, a Russian company that Mueller has charged with financing efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Ammika Harris is reportedly standing by Chris Brown throughout his arrest in Paris for rape earlier this month.

Musician Brown, 29, is said to be leaning on Ammika as a ‘rock’ while a 24-year-old woman continues to allege that he ‘pressured’ her into sex at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on 15 January.

Brown, who was released from police custody without charge within 24 hours, is thought to have found ‘comfort and strength’ from Instagram model Ammika in light of the claims, which he calls ‘false and so disrespectful’ to his family.

A source told Hollywood Life: ‘Chris is enjoying his time with Ammika, she was a big source of comfort and strength to him after everything that went down in Paris. She has been a rock for him.

‘He appreciates and is grateful for how she handled it all and for how she has helped him stay positive.

‘He isn’t putting any labels on things with Ammika yet, but he seems to be very happy in her company.’

Brown was thought to have been in a relationship with Ammika just before the incident since they were seen partying together on the night of Chris’s arrest.

According to the insider, Ammika has previously helped Chris ‘put Rihanna out of his mind’ and is now helping him to ‘move ahead in life.’

The rapper has been linked to Ammika since as far back as 2015, but not much is known about the 25-year-old or how the pair initially met.

The model making the accusations against Brown has not dropped her case in light of a lawsuit he has filed against her for defamation.

The young woman, who has not been named for legal reasons, says she was ‘cornered her in a room that was locked’ where she was faced with ‘forced sexual relations,’ TMZ reports.

In a statement released by her lawyer last Friday, it was claimed: ‘She was not pressured physically. This was a very particular environment with great psychological pressure.’

Adorable footage of former conjoined twins Nima and Dawa show how they have made an astounding recovery just three months after a life-changing operation to separate them.

The 18-month-old twins, who were joined at the lower chest and through their abdomen, are just weeks away from heading home to Bhutan, following the surgery at Melbourne's Royal Children Hospital.

The girls are adapting well to their independence from each other and are now playing like any other youngsters their age.

Nima, Dawa and their mother are now preparing on heading home as the period of post-surgery supervision draws to a close.

'The girls will need some additional nutritional assistance and some physiotherapy to aid their recovery,' Children First foundation executive Elizabeth Lodge said on Thursday.

'I would say we are weeks away from seeing the girls return home,' Ms Lodge added.

'The girls have made such strides here, I would hope we can give them a base where just being home with their siblings and being in an environment where they are encouraged to eat well, they will do their rest and rehab ­naturally,' Dr Crameri, head of paediatric surgery at the Royal Children Hospital, told The Herald Sun.

Dr Crameri also said the date the girls could return home was dependent on an upcoming conference with Bhutan medical staff, in which they will assess the services available to the twins in their home country.

The girls' mother, Bhumchu Zangmo, is said to be delighted at their recovery, but looking forward to flying home to her four other children and husband.

The twins and their mother arrived in Australia in October last year, but the girls didn't have surgery until November 9.

The original procedure was postponed after a check-up revealed the twins needed additional nutritional support before they could have the operation.

The only paediatrician in Bhutan, who has had a long involvement in the twin's care, also flew to Melbourne to offer their support to the family.

Carers at the Children First Foundation, the charity that covered cost of the flights and accommodation for the twins and their mother, have been delighted with the girls' progress and said how 'wonderful' they are to look after.

'We want them to go home but it will be hard to see them go,' retreat manager Debbie Pickering said.

The Victoria state government offered to foot the bill for the procedure and recovery, which is estimated to cost around $350,000."

The alleged racist and homophobic-fueled hate crime against Empire actor Jussie Smollett has rocked the Internet and shaken the nation.

Many people are eager for the alleged MAGA-loving thugs to be held accountable for the assault. So when the Chicago Police announced on Twitter that after scouring surveillance footage, they’d be releasing photos of some “persons of interest” in the case, people were READY for justice to be served.

Unfortunately, what we were greeted with from the Chicago PD was about as helpful in solving this case as sending someone to find a needle in a haystack.

Honestly, y’all might as well just have said, “We still lookin” instead of releasing these damn shadowy figures like somebody’s really supposed to be able to go up to someone and say, “Hey, ain’t you the ones that jumped Jamal from Empire?”

But anyway, I guess, if you were in the Chicago area and you recognize those generic-ass dudes in black hoodies, leave a tip or something for the Chicago PD here."

Cops have now shared images of two persons of interest wanted for questioning over the assault which allegedly saw the actor subjected to racist and homophobic slurs.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said “detectives are taking this development seriously and wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed”.

The grainy photos show two men walking on North New Street near East Illinois Street at around 1.45am on Tuesday.

Jussie - who is known for playing Jamal Lyon in Empire - told cops that he was walking alone down East North Water Street at 2am when the two men jumped him.

The men, who TMZ claim were both white, recognised him from the show then attacked him – fracturing his rib as Jussie tried to fight back.

They then reportedly put a rope around his neck and covered him in bleach, while shouting ""This is MAGA country"" (Make America Great Again).

Jussie’s representative, Brandon Z. Moore, also claimed to have heard the men yell those words as well.

“I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,” Moore told Variety.

Jussie, who is black and gay and who plays a gay character in the hit Fox drama, said the men also called him a “f***ot”.

He was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, but has since been released while Chicago PD are investigating the incident at battery.

Chicago PD told TMZ: ""[We] received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire.

Maxine Waters.

Smollett, who is black and gay, reportedly told police he was assaulted by two white men in Chicago early Tuesday morning who beat him, placed a noose around his neck, doused him in bleach, and yelled this is ""MAGA country,"" among other racial and homophobic slurs. He has since been discharged from hospital.

“I know Jussie. I love him. His family’s a friend of mine. I know his sisters, I've met his mom, and I called already to Jazz, one of the sisters, to talk to her about what’s happening, about what’s going on,” Waters told the Grio in a video published Tuesday.

“I’m pleased that he’s doing okay. But we have to understand this is happening for a reason. Why all of a sudden do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have a picnic while black, and being attacked?” Waters said. “It’s coming from the president of the United States. He’s dog whistling every day. He’s separating and dividing, and he is basically emboldening those folks who feel this way.”

This is not the first time Waters has weighed in on Smollett's alleged attack.

""I'm dedicated to finding the culprits and bringing them to justice. Jussie did not deserve to be harmed by anyone!"" she tweeted shortly after news broke of the incident.

Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., on Wednesday called on the FBI to investigate the matter as a hate crime. The bureau is reportedly already investigating a letter Smollett received last week, including one that read, ""You will die black fag.""

“As you are aware, crimes of this nature strike fear at the very core of a community and have a long-lasting impact on its members,” Rush wrote in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray. “They are, therefore, rightfully characterized as hate crimes. That the perpetrators in this attack are reported to have wrapped a rope around the victim's neck is jarring, to say the least, and a surprise to many people who believe that lynching has been relegated to the annals of our history.”"

Jan. 30 (UPI) -- Chicago police released images of ""people of interest"" to the investigation of an alleged hate crime attack on actor-singer Jussie Smollett Wednesday night.

The two images posted on Twitter by Chicago police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi come from surveillance footage of two individuals walking down a street with their backs to the camera.

Smollett reported to police early Tuesday that he was outside at about 2 a.m. to pick up food when two men asssaulted him, tossed an unknown chemical on him and put a rope around his neck, while making homophobic and racist remarks.

The Empire star was briefly hospitalized and treated for his injuries. Police said the incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Before the images were released, Guglielmi told the Chicago Tribune that the individuals were captured on video in an area close in proximity and time to where the altercation happened.

""They are outside on a street walking. They are in the area that we have determined it could have taken place ... in the time and the area,'' Guglielimi said of the persons of interest. ""It certainly leads us to have questions for them.''

Numerous celebrities, including Halle Berry, Michael B. Jordan and Lee Daniels, offered their support to Smollett on Tuesday and Wednesday, condemning the attack."

CHICAGO (Fox 32 News) - Police in Chicago located a surveillance camera Wednesday that shows “potential persons of interest” who are wanted for questioning in the alleged assault of ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett.

Police are hoping someone will recognize the ""potential persons of interest"" so that officers can speak to them about the reported assault.

Police released the following statement: ""Chicago Police detectives have located surveillance cameras that show potential people of interest in the alleged assault and battery that was reported in the 300 block of E. North Water Street (Empire cast member). While the video footage does not depict an assault, the individuals pictured are seen in the vicinity of the alleged criminal incident during the alleged time of occurence. Detectives are taking this investigation seriously and urging anyone with any information on the identity of these individuals to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8380 or anonymously at www.cpdtip.com""

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said two men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment Tuesday morning after getting food and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, police said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the ""thin rope"" around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Smollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is also investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, police said.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct ""an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.""

There has been a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack ""outrageous"" and ""awful.""

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.

Activist Andrew Holmes offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in Smollett’s attack. Holmes said confidential tips can be called in at (800) 883-5587.

More than a dozen police detectives, some specializing in hate crimes, are working the case. They asked anyone who has information or witnessed the attack to call detectives at (312) 747-8382 or submit an anonymous tip at cpdtip.com."

Much of the television world is still very much reeling from some of the terrible news regarding Empire and series star Jussie Smollett. The actor was beaten and had a rope hung around his neck earlier this week in the midst of a hate-filled attack. There are a number of persons in the case, and the situation moving forward is now ongoing.

So what are the show and its producers behind the scenes doing behind the scenes in order to cope with this horrible situation? Well, much of it is about just trying to ensure justice is served, and also putting one foot after the next. According to Entertainment Tonight, the show will have added security in the wake of the attack and, to go along with that, there are counselors on set in order to help people who are struggling:

“The counselors will be there for as long as the cast and crew needs … Everyone processes trauma differently and the network understands that. The pace of filming will be based on how everyone feels, and the network and people involved want to do whatever they can to make the cast and crew feel safe and supported.”

Smollett could return to the show as early as next week to continue playing the part of Jamal Lyon, but we know that this story is far from over. Like Jamal on the show has overcome many obstacles, we’re sure that Smollett is going to overcome this and be a voice for the voiceless. Before that, though, he also needs a little bit of time so that he can properly heal and figure out how, when, and if he wants to speak up. He’s the one who has endured a horrific situation and because of that, he has a right in order to properly dictate what he wants to do and how he wants to speak up.

In addition to dealing with this horrific situation, Empire and many other Chicago-filmed shows are also in the midst of dealing with record-low temperatures due to the polar vortex. The show will go on and beyond just that, it will do so as a family. That atmosphere is one of the reasons why this show has done as well as it has: These people legitimately care about each other.

The images emerged as Smollett's representative, Brandon Z. Moore, revealed he was on the phone with the actor when the attack happened and claims to have heard the men yell 'this is MAGA country'.

'I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,' Moore told Variety.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi shared the images on Twitter Wednesday evening.

'Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,' Guglielmi wrote.

Guglielmi noted that while the video 'does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed'.

The photos show two men walking on North New Street near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday.

Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him. He was heading to his apartment at the time.

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

The release of the photos comes just hours after officers said they were unable to find an footage that showed two men attacking the actor.

Officers said that detectives reviewed CCTV video of Smollett walking to his apartment building in downtown Chicago Tuesday morning, and ‘for the most part’ they can confirm the route he took when he says he was accosted by the assailants.

However, Guglielmi noted there were gaps and none of the footage police had reviewed showed the alleged attack.

Authorities said a community alert with photos is being constructed and will be disseminated shortly.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox drama, said the white men wearing ski masks assaulted him, hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, doused him with an ‘unknown chemical substance’ previously reported as bleach and put a thin rope around his neck.

The actor, who came out as gay to Ellen in 2015, had been walking from a local Subway sandwich shop when he was jumped.

'Aren't you the f***ot 'Empire' n*****?' Smollett recalled the men yelling at him.

The men then screamed MAGA before fleeing the scene.

Smollett suffered a fractured rib during the attack and is said to have put up a fight when he was beaten.

A noose was still around his neck at 2.42am when police arrived to the scene.

The actor then took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he was treated then released on Tuesday.

Smollett had just flown into Chicago from New York City just hours before the attack.

The actor had been in the Big Apple with actor Zachary Quinto Monday morning during a reading of Richard Greenberg’s seminal play Take Me Out, according to a post Quinto shared on Instagram.

Smollett said what should have been a two-hour flight from New York City to Chicago turned into a seven-hour nightmare due to the extreme cold.

The attack took place here on Tuesday. When cops arrived at 2.42am, Smollett still had the noose around his neck

Guglielmi said detectives investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have already looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area.

Officers expanded the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the crime scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

‘We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didn’t find a container anywhere,’ Guglielmi said earlier on Wednesday, referring to a container for the liquid that was thrown at the actor.

Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the US, with thousands of CCTV cameras mounted on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

It was previously reported that just a week before the alleged attack, Fox offered the singer and actor based in Chicago an entourage of body guards for protection after the show's studio received a threatening, homophobic letter addressed to Smollett.

But Smollett declined around-the-clock security because he found it intrusive, according to TMZ.

The letter threatening Smollett was sent to the Fox studio on January 22, cops said according to ABC, and was laced with a powdery substance believed to be Tylenol.

The FBI is now trying to determine if there's a link between the homophobic letter and the Tuesday attack.

Following the accident Fox has added security for the rest of the Empire cast. Much of the cast live in Chicago during filming.

On Tuesday the actor was brutally attacked by two white men wearing ski masks yelling 'This is MAGA country' as they poured bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, that appears to be dated from January 18, stating that 'You will die black f*g'. Fox Studio received the letter on the 22nd and cops said it was laced with powder Tylenol

Smollett told CNN that he was shaken and angry following the incident.

His co-star Terrence Howard, who plays his father on Empire, described Smollett as furious on Good Morning America.

'I heard he's getting better. You now, he's angry. But I know Jussie. Jussie's anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won't, and we can't, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance,' Howard said.

'Jussie’s the one that starts singing when everybody’s in a bad mood. He’s the one that cheers everybody up. He’s the one that does all the Instagrams if he catches you sleeping. Today, no one was caught sleeping. No one even took time to close their eyes and nap. They were all in shock that our family — you know, the Fox family, the family, the Lyon family — were attacked by a bunch of hyenas today,' the 49-year-old actor added.

Howard said when the cast learned of the attack their 'jaws dropped to the ground'.

'When we learned that there had been letters that had been sent to Fox as threats about the potential about this, then we became much more frightened, he added.

Smollett missed shooting on the set on Tuesday as he recovered from the brutal attack.

He reportedly still intends to return to the set and Empire will resume as planned.

Smollett's sister, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, was spotted on the set of her new movie, Birds of Prey, a spinoff of Suicide Squad, a day after her brother was attacked.

Smollett-Bell was holding her toddler son Hunter as she wrapped up filming in Los Angeles.

Police have made no arrests and have no solid suspects at this time. They are opening the investigation for surveillance footage from nearby businesses and traffic cameras

Chicago Police said they canvassed the upscale downtown neighborhood where Smollett was attacked and found no still images or video from security cameras of the attack.

Cops have obtained surveillance footage of Smollett inside a Subway before the attack, but not any footage of the assailants.

'The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras. As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders,' Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

'Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect's vehicle to be able to share,' he added.

Police have made no arrests and have no solid suspects at this time. They are opening the investigation to nearby businesses, traffic cameras, and nearby streets for surveillance footage.

A dozen police detectives and FBI are working in the case, according to CNN.

'Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,' police said.

Smollett rose to fame play Jamal Lyon - an openly gay singer - on Fox's 'Empire' in 2015.

The show released a statement following the incident.

The Chicago Police Department is investigating the case as a racially-charged battery and assault

Prior to the attack, Smollett had been stranded in LaGuardia's Airpot in New York for upwards of five hours while he waited for weather to become permissible in Chicago

20th Century Fox released a statement sending their love and support to the actor

'We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our 'Empire' family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,' the show said.

'We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate -- and especially against one of our own,' the statement added.

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollet received a cut out letter that appears to be dated as January 18 that stated 'You will die black f*g'.

Prior to the attack, Smollett had been stranded in LaGuardia's Airport in New York for upwards of five hours while he waited for weather to become permissible in Chicago.

He updated his followers throughout the day showing the weather in Chicago and talking about his flight delays.

Following the horrific accident, celebrities and politicians have voiced their support for the actor and demand justice.

Every single Democrat who has entered the 2020 primary had issued a statement condemning the individuals who committed this act by Tuesday afternoon.

According to TMZ, the figures in the pictures were at New Street near the intersection with E. Illinois Street between 1:30 AM and 1:45 AM, one block from the Subway fast-food eatery where Jussie was heading.

The Chicago Police Department is investigating the incident as a possible racially-charged assault and battery, and treating it ‘as a possible hate crime’.

Jussie was intersected by two individuals, allegedly white men, on his way to get food after a flight from New York to Chicago in the early hours.

The attackers are alleged to have beaten up Jussie, who is famous for playing Jamal Lyon in sitcom Empire, ‘put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him’.

Jussie told police the attackers yelled ‘MAGA country’, denoting the phrase ‘Make America Great Again’.

Nine days ago, Jussie was sent a letter in the post to Fox Studios which read: ‘You will die black f**.’

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago police said on Wednesday they would soon release images of “persons of interest” in the assault of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett in which two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs and wrapped a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was not seriously hurt in the Tuesday incident, which police were treating as a possible hate crime.

The images came from a surveillance camera near the attack, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted.

The two men approached Smollett on the street in the early hours of Tuesday, yelling racial and homophobic slurs, then hit him in the face, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

A representative for Smollett did not respond to requests for comment.

“Empire,” a hip-hop musical drama series, from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc premiered on television in 2015. Its lead actress, Taraji P.

""Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,"" Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday evening alongside the photos the individuals. ""While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.""

Speaking to PEOPLE, Guglielmi opened up further on the seriousness of the attack against Smollett, sharing he was hopeful the new video evidence would help them solve the crime.

""The victim goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men,"" Guglielmi said. ""They were masked and wearing black clothing. They called him an Empire... and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.""

He then revealed the actor returned to his apartment and called his manager, who quickly arrived to Smollett's home and they agreed to call the police.

Police patrols ""responded to the residence to take a report and the victim was still wearing the rope around his neck when they arrived,"" Guglielmi said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago police said on Wednesday they would soon release images of ""persons of interest"" in the assault of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett in which two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs and wrapped a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old African-American actor, who is gay, was not seriously hurt in the Tuesday incident, which police were treating as a possible hate crime.

The images came from a surveillance camera near the attack, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted.

The two men approached Smollett on the street in the early hours of Tuesday, yelling racial and homophobic slurs, then hit him in the face, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing, police said.

A representative for Smollett did not respond to requests for comment.

""Empire,"" a hip-hop musical drama series, from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc premiered on television in 2015. Its lead actress, Taraji P. Henson, won a Golden Globe Award in 2016 for her role and the show has received multiple Emmy Award nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

CHICAGO – Detectives reviewed surveillance footage of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett walking to his downtown Chicago apartment, but so far none of the video shows him being attacked by two masked men, although investigators have obtained images of people they would like to question, a police spokesman said Wednesday.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” Wednesday evening.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood after visiting a sandwich shop, Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps, and none of the footage shows an attack, he said, although the review is ongoing.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene’s immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Smollett’s description of the suspects.

“We haven’t seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave. Nobody looks menacing, and we didn’t find a container anywhere,” Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that the actor said was thrown at him.

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told the Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor “is at home and recovering.”

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

After the attack, Smollett returned to his apartment, and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant. According to Guglielmi, the 36-year-old later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct “an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.”

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

The report of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who knows Smollett. She called the attack “outrageous” and “awful.”

Some of the outrage stems from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department’s use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president’s 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated."

But hours later Chicago Police's Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi released two photos of those possibly connected to the alleged beating on Twitter.

""While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,"" Guglielmi wrote.

The pictures appear to show two people, dressed in dark clothing, walking along a sidewalk next to a building.

Investigators told Fox News that while walking near the Chicago River around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Smollett said two men approached him and yelled, ""This is MAGA country."" The actor told police the men struck him in the face with their hands and poured an unknown chemical on him before wrapping a rope around his neck.

Smollett, according to authorities, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

""Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.""

Smollett was attacked by two people who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"" and ""poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,"" police said.

One of Smollett's alleged attackers also put a rope around his neck, according to police. Both fled the scene.

Smollett took himself to Northwestern Hospital and ""is in good condition,"" authorities said.

As of Tuesday evening, a Chicago police spokesperson told CNN that investigators canvassed the neighborhood where the reported attack occurred and have found no still images or video from security cameras of the incident.

The only image of Smollett police obtained from security cameras was inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime. The actor was seen standing alone.

Chicago police detectives continue to investigate the ""serious allegations,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said early Wednesday.

""The Streeterville neighborhood where the alleged attack occurred has a very high density of city and private surveillance cameras. As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders,"" he said.

""Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect's vehicle to be able to share.""

Guglielmi said detective teams will broaden their search area and work around the clock to look for video on traffic cameras, buses and neighboring streets.

A dozen police detectives, with the assistance of the FBI, are working the case, he said.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,"" the police statement said.

Investigators are testing the chemical Smollett said he was doused with and have yet to confirm the nature of the substance.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago police said on Wednesday they would soon release images of ""persons of interest"" in the assault of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett in which two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs and wrapped a rope around his neck.

Investigators “for the most part” can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search .

Smollett also has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.

According to TMZ, the two (above) individuals were walking on New Street near the intersection of E. Illinois Street between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. They are about a block away from the Subway restaurant Jussie had gone to Tuesday morning.

Authorities want to speak to the possible suspects to determine if they witnessed or were involved in the incident.

The Chicago police department released two very blurry photos Wednesday night showing two individuals walking down a dark sidewalk.

“Chicago police say detectives want to talk to the people seen on surveillance. They are not calling them suspects. Because there is an allegation of a hate crime, a community alert will be issued,” ABC7 Chicago reporter Rob Elgas said in a social media post Wednesday.

Smollett, star of the TV show Empire, claimed that he was the victim of an assault in Chicago around 2 a.m. on Tuesday morning. Smollett says he was approached by two men who beat his face and poured a liquid substance on him before one of them wrapped a rope around his neck, a police report said. Smollett was still wearing the rope some 40 minutes after the attack when police first contacted the actor. Smollett took himself to the hospital and was later released.

TMZ initially reported that two white men in ski masks beat Smollett then “put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, ‘This is MAGA country.'” However, a Chicago Police Department spokesperson later said the gender and race of the alleged attackers are still unknown because, according to Smollett, they were wearing ski masks and gloves.

The attackers also allegedly yelled, “Aren’t you that faggot ‘Empire’ n*****?” at Smollett.

Additionally, Smollett’s music manager, Brandon Moore, told police that he was on the phone with Smollett during the alleged attack and heard the words “MAGA country.”

Chicago police are currently investigating the alleged attack as a possible hate crime.

Politicians and celebrities have taken to social media to express support for Smollett.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a tweet Tuesday, “The racist, homophobic attack on JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.”

“What happened today to JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie,” Joe Biden said.

White House hopeful and California Sen. Kamala Harris also chimed in, “JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery.”

“This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”"

The Empire star — who came out on Ellen DeGeneres’s talk show in 2015 — was stopped around 2 a.m. on Tuesday in downtown Chicago by two men wearing ski masks and yelling racial and homophobic slurs. The individuals then placed a noose around Smollett’s neck. The two men punched Smollett and then poured an unknown substance on him.

""This is MAGA country,"" the men then yelled, according to Chicago police officials who spoke to The Advocate. This information was gleaned from interviews with Smollett after the attack, according to the CPD.

Smollett was able to return to his apartment nearby and had his manager call police who arrived about 40 minutes later, Chicago police say. Upon arrival, officers saw that the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face. A rope hung around his neck, which he states was put there by an assailant.

The actor was able to self-transport himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to.

Chicago police are still investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, and the FBI has joined in after being alerted that Smollett received threatening hate mail at Fox Studios in Chicago.

The letters were addressed to the star and stated “You will die black Fag” in magazine cutout letters alongside a drawing of a person, presumably Smollett, being shot.

The FBI has not responded to a request for comment on their investigation or its scope.

As news of the attacks continues to spread around the world, the actor has seen an immense amount of support from politicians, celebrities, and fans. Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted out support, alongside Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and virtually all other Democratic leaders; even actor Kevin Hart shared his dismay at the attack.

Presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Cory Booker used the incident to highlight their anti-lynching legislation that now awaits a House vote after passing the Senate.

“It’s outrageous. I know Jussie — he is one of the kindest most gentle people I have ever met,” Harris said on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon. “It’s awful.”

Harris and Booker have been making requests to the Democratic-led Congress to pass their legislation with “urgency” in the wake of the attack.

Smollett has yet to respond publicly to the attacks, but the actor’s management has informed The Advocate that he will be flying to Los Angeles this weekend to perform at a previously scheduled concert.

Fox Studios says the cast of Empire will continue filming the show’s next season and has increased security for the entire show."

Smollett reported to police early Tuesday that he was outside at about 2 a.m. to pick up food when two men asssaulted him, tossed an unknown chemical on him and put a rope around his neck, while making homophobic and racist remarks.

The ""Empire"" star was briefly hospitalized and treated for his injuries. Police said the incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Guglielmi told the Chicago Tribune the images the police found did not capture the altercation.

""They are outside on a street walking. They are in the area that we have determined it could have taken place ... in the time and the area,'' Guglielimi said of the persons of interest.

""It certainly leads us to have questions for them.''

UsMagazine.com quoted Guglielimi as saying a community alert with the photos is being put together in hopes members of the public will help identify the people in the images so police can talk to them.

Numerous celebrities, including Halle Berry, Michael B. Jordan and Lee Daniels, offered their support to Smollett on Tuesday and Wednesday, condemning the attack."

It comes on the heels of earlier reports that authorities were struggling to find video evidence in connection with the alleged attack of the 35-year-old actor who said he was attacked by masked men near his home in Chicago Tuesday.

“CASE UPDATE: Tonight #ChicagoPolice detectives expanded the search area for cameras to be able to provide photos of the alleged assailants in this attack.

“The victim goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men,” Guglielmi stated. “They were masked and wearing black clothing. They called him an Empire … and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.”

Smollett said that he managed to get away and call the police. Officers “responded to the residence to take a report and the victim was still wearing the rope around his neck when they arrived. He explained to them why he had the rope around his neck, and the officers closed their body cams at his request, because they were in his private residence,” the police spokesperson added.

In a follow-up interview with authorities, police said Smollett told them that his attackers reportedly yelled out the “Make America Great Again” abbreviation, “MAGA.”

“In the initial reports there was no mention of MAGA,” the statement read. “When detectives [followed] up with him later in the day, he recalled the offenders making those comments and detectives completed a supplemental report.”"

CASE UPDATE: Hours ago #ChicagoPolice detectives located a surveillance camera that shows potential persons of interest wanted for questioning in reference to the assault & battery of Empire actor. A community alert w/ photos is being constructed and will be disseminated shortly.

ABC 7 Chicago‘s Rob Elgas says that the video the images were captured from doesn’t show the alleged assault:

For those just hearing about this story, here’s a brief recap of what’s alleged to have happened to the “Empire” actor – via Red State‘s Brad Slager:

As was widely reported yesterday and throughout the evening, singer/actor Jussie Smollett was admitted into a hospital following an incident where the entertainer said he was attacked on the street in Chicago by a pair of assailants. The star of the Fox drama “Empire” who is openly gay said they used racial and homophobic epithets as they beat him, poured bleach on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck. Outrage has flooded in, more so once the details became the assailants were whites wearing red Donald Trump hats, and were said to have shouted “MAGA Country” during the assault. A wide array of politicians, celebrities, and members of the media have risen to voice outrage at this attack.

As Brad astutely pointed out in his piece this morning, there are a lot of questions and unknowns so far about this case, so it’s best to take a “wait and see” approach before jumping to conclusions – because recent events have reaffirmed to us on how travelling down that road can turn out badly.

As soon as the police department makes the community alert and photos of the potential persons of interest available to the public, this post will be updated to share that information.

UPDATE: The images have just been released:

UPDATE (3/26/19), 11:35 AM EST: The charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett — over allegedly staging a racial attack against himself in Chicago on January 29 — have all been dropped, his Chicago-based attorney Ronald Safer confirms to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued the following statement (on March 26, 2019 at 1:15 PM EST) in wake of this development: “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”

ORIGINAL: Getting closer to justice. A day after Chicago police reported two unidentified individuals put a rope around Jussie Smollet’s neck, poured a chemical substance on him and battered his face on Jan. 29, they found a surveillance camera in the area. In screengrabs of the footage below, you can see two individuals walking on the sidewalk in dark clothing. “Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,” Anthony Guglielmi, the police’s chief communications officer, tweeted on Jan. 30, referring to the photos. Unfortunately, the officer revealed the “video does not capture an encounter,” but the individuals will still be questioned — more surveillance cameras will be reviewed.

Jussie, an actor on Empire who had came out as gay in 2015, was attacked outside a Subway at 2 a.m. after he returned on a delayed flight from New York. “Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department told HollywoodLife in a statement. After maliciously attacking Jussie, the actor took himself to Northwestern Hospital afterwards, and authorities reported he was in “good condition.”

Jussie sustained a cut on the face, as seen in a photo of his injury, and reportedly a fractured rib, according to TMZ. Brandon Z. Moore, Jussie’s manager, was reportedly on the phone with the actor during the attack and told police he heard the assailants yell “MAGA country,” in addition to the racial and homophobic slurs, the outlet added. The ambush is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Spokesperson of the Chicago Police Department, tweeted, “Chicago Police detectives have located a surveillance camera that shows potential persons of interest wanted for questioning in reference to the assault and battery of an ‘Empire’ actor. A community alert w/ photos is being constructed and will be disseminated shortly.”

ABC 7 Chicago reports the video shows two people walking in the vicinity of the attack, but not the actual assault. Officers are seeking those two individuals.

The police later released a community alert with the photo below, stating, ""Detectives are seeking to identify and interview the two subjects depicted in the pictures... walking on New St. near Illinois, between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. in order to determine whether they may have any involvement in the reported incident, or if they may have witnessed the incident.""

TMZ reported Smollett, who is black, was attacked by two white men in ski masks early Tuesday morning in Chicago. The men allegedly pulled a noose around his neck and shouted homophobic and racial slurs while beating him, fracturing a rib.

The department also told the site that Jussie told them in an interview that the men were yelling “MAGA country.” MAGA stands for President Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again.”"

The actor was the victim of what police are investigating as a possible hate crime. Smollett's attackers, who were described as white and male, approached him by ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"" then hit him in the face, poured bleach on him and put a rope around his neck, the actor said.

Smollett and his music manager told the police they were on the phone with each other during the alleged attack, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CNN.

His manager said that he heard the attackers shout ""this is MAGA country"", in reference to Donald Trump's infamous presidential campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"".

Both attackers fled the scene. Smollet took himself to hospital and was in ""good condition"" in the hours following, according to authorities.

Investigators have since located a surveillance camera that shows two people who are now wanted for questioning. They have not yet found still images or video of the actual incident, police said on Tuesday 29 January.

The assault took place jsut a week after Fox studios received a threatening, homophobic letter addressed to Smollett. Police said it was sent on 22 January, and that the letter was laced with a powdery substance believed to be Tylenol. They are currently attempting to determine whether there is a link between the letter and the Tuesday attack.

The Chicago Police Department has reportedly obtained surveillance video of “persons of interest” in connection with the assault on Jussie Smollett earlier this week.

Chicago PD chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted stills from the footage Wednesday night. They appear to show two people walking on the sidewalk of an otherwise deserted street.

""Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member. While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,"" Guglielmi tweeted.

The attack, which left Smollett hospitalized, took place in Chicago at around 2 a.m. local time Tuesday morning. A police statement says the actor has been released from the hospital and is currently in “good condition.”

Sources close to the actor and musician, best known for playing Jamal Lyon on Fox series Empire, told TMZ that his assailants hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him (“Aren’t you that faggot Empire n*****?”) during the attack. Chicago PD says that they also tied a noose around his neck and poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him, which TMZ identified as bleach in their reporting.

Smollett says that his assailants yelled “MAGA country” during the attack, police confirmed to CBS News Wednesday afternoon. Brandon Z. Moore, Smollett’s music manager, was on the phone with the actor during the attack. He confirmed the language that Smollett says his assailants used.

“I heard that clearly. I heard the scuffle, and I heard the racial slur,” Moore told Variety.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is assisting in the investigation, ABC News reports. They are considering the attack a possible hate crime.

Police have released photographs of two people they wish to question in relation to the alleged assault on Jussie Smollett.

The star, 35, was targeted in an apparent hate crime attack by two black-clad, masked men in Chicago’s Streeterville section near his home on Tuesday. Smollett was treated at Northwestern Hospital and remains in stable condition.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi released an update on the case, revealing how investigators have acquired footage that could lead to the arrests of the Empire actor’s assailants.

The police released two photos of the persons of interest, however, the images did not show the individuals’ faces.

“Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,” Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday evening alongside the photos of the figures, both wearing dark clothing, walking side-by-side. “While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.”

The latest in the investigation comes after Guglielmi told PEOPLE he was optimistic video evidence will surface that will help them solve the apparent hate crime attack.

Describing the details of the allegations as “heinous,” Guglielmi said police had widened their search of surveillance cameras — both public and private — in the area surrounding the site of the alleged attack.

“The victim goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men,” Guglielmi stated. “They were masked and wearing black clothing. They called him an Empire … and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.”

Guglielmi said the actor returned to his apartment afterward, and called his manager, who quickly made his way to Smollett’s home. “The manager goes to the apartment, and they agree to call police. The manager called us at 2:40 a.m.,” Guglielmi added.

Police patrols “responded to the residence to take a report and the victim was still wearing the rope around his neck when they arrived,” he said. “He explained to them why he had the rope around his neck, and the officers closed their body cams at his request, because they were in his private residence.”

A rep for Smollett has not responded to PEOPLE’s requests for comment.

In his second interview with police, Smollett remembered his attackers calling out the abbreviation of Donald Trump‘s slogan “Make America Great Again,” according to a statement from the Chicago Police previously obtained by PEOPLE.

Before Smollett’s incident, additional security was hired for the Empire set after Fox Studios’ Chicago offices allegedly received a threatening homophobic letter addressed to the actor, who is gay, last week. TMZ first reported the news.

The FBI is investigating that alleged letter, Guglielmi told PEOPLE.

In photos of the purported letter — which were obtained by GrapeJuice.net and TMZ — the words “you will die black f–” are spelled out in magazine letter cut-outs.

PEOPLE has reached out to the FBI for comment.

“These young men had to drive in from somewhere…they had to walk in from somewhere,” Guglielmi told PEOPLE on Wednesday. “If and when this occurred, we will find some kind of digital evidence of it. We have the largest private surveillance network in the country with 3,500 cameras citywide. That particular area’s saturated with our cameras as well as private cameras and red light cameras. If someone drove into this area, we will find them.”"

Jan. 30 (UPI) -- Chicago police released images of ""people of interest"" to the investigation of an alleged hate crime attack on actor-singer Jussie Smollett Wednesday night.

The two images posted on Twitter by Chicago police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi come from surveillance footage of two individuals walking down a street with their backs to the camera.

Smollett reported to police early Tuesday that he was outside at about 2 a.m. to pick up food when two men asssaulted him, tossed an unknown chemical on him and put a rope around his neck, while making homophobic and racist remarks.

The Empire star was briefly hospitalized and treated for his injuries. Police said the incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Before the images were released, Guglielmi told the Chicago Tribune that the individuals were captured on video in an area close in proximity and time to where the altercation happened.

""They are outside on a street walking. They are in the area that we have determined it could have taken place ... in the time and the area,'' Guglielimi said of the persons of interest. ""It certainly leads us to have questions for them.''

Numerous celebrities, including Halle Berry, Michael B. Jordan and Lee Daniels, offered their support to Smollett on Tuesday and Wednesday, condemning the attack."

“Hours ago #ChicagoPolice detectives located a surveillance camera that shows potential persons of interest wanted for questioning in reference to the assault & battery of Empire actor,” wrote Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi on Twitter.

“A community alert w/ photos is being constructed and will be disseminated shortly.”

Guglielmi posted his Twitter update at 5:53 p.m. Central Standard Time.

The 36-year-old Smollett, brother of actress Jurnee Smollett, said he was attacked at about 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday morning in Chicago’s upscale, North Side Streeterville neighborhood, according to the Daily Beast. He told police detectives that his assailants struck him in the face, poured some kind of liquid him, and threw a rope around his neck — all while shouting racial and anti-gay invective.

Smollett is both African-American and gay. He also told police, as the Inquisitr has reported, that during the attack, the assailants shouted, “This is MAGA country!” in reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan associated with Donald Trump.

Smollett could describe his attackers only as men in “dark clothing and ski masks” according to NBC News. Police believe the liquid that the attackers threw on Smollett was bleach. The actor said that the attack occurred when he left his home in the early morning hours to obtain a late-night snack.

In addition to the surveillance footage that police now say they have obtained, showing at least some of the possible attackers, Variety reported that at the time of the attack, Smollett was speaking on his cell phone with Brandon Z. Moore, Smollett’s manager for his music career. Moore told Variety that he was able to hear at least some of the attack as it transpired.

Moore told the magazine that he had given a statement about what he heard to Chicago police, but he would not give further details due to the fact that the police investigation into the attack remains ongoing.

In an angry Instagram post, Empire co-creator Lee Daniels called the attack on Smollett “just another f*****g day in America,” as quoted by the New York Daily News."

He is accused of allegedly staging an attack in Chicago with the help of two other people.

President Donald Trump has not responded to an actor’s account that he was attacked by racist and homophobic masked men who referred to Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan during the assault. Top Republicans in Congress have been similarly silent about the incident.

Jussie Smollett, an actor, musician, and activist best known for his role in the television show Empire, told police he was attacked in Chicago by two masked men early Tuesday morning. Smollett, who is Black and gay and plays a queer character on Empire, told police in a followup interview later Tuesday that his attackers said he was in “MAGA country.” MAGA is shorthand for Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

Chicago police said they were told two people approached Smollett at 2 a.m. and yelled homophobic and racial slurs at the actor. According to police, Smollett said the attackers hit him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and put a rope around his neck. Earlier in the month, a letter threatening Smollett that included a homophobic epithet and white powder, which turned out not to be dangerous, was mailed to the set where Empire is filmed, police said. The FBI is investigating the letter as Chicago police investigate the incident as a possible hate crime, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Trump has yet to comment on Smollett’s account. Similarly, none of the Republican leaders in the Senate or House of Representatives have commented on Facebook, Twitter, or their websites. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) responded to the news on Twitter by calling the alleged attack “an affront to our humanity.” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is chair of outreach for Senate Democrats, called it a “horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country.”

The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all. — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) January 30, 2019

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) criticized media outlets’ use of the words “racially-charged” to describe the reported attack on Twitter.

There is no such thing as “racially charged.” This attack was not “possibly” homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack.

Julian Castro (D), former secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), all of whom are either officially running for president in 2020 or known to be considering it, tweeted in response to the news.

This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it's the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color.

Praying for Jussie and his family. https://t.co/eylvxhLT0u — Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) January 29, 2019

Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL) sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday in which he called for a hate crimes investigation into the attack. Last year, Rush introduced legislation to make lynching a federal crime — H.R. 35, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act.

“As you are aware, crimes of this nature strike fear at the very core of a community and have a long-lasting impact on its members,” Rush wrote.

Phyllis B. Gerstenfeld, professor of criminal justice at California State University said hate crimes are often difficult to prosecute. Gerstenfeld used her state as an example.

“In an average year, California has less than a hundred hate crime convictions even though close to 2,000 hate crimes are reported. So prosecutors don’t charge them very often or get convictions very often,” she told ThinkProgress in an interview. “The reason for that is you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender was motivated by race, sexual orientation, whatever, and that’s a really hard thing to do even if someone shouts out slurs.”

Gerstenfeld said that police training needs to be improved to identify potential hate crimes. Many law enforcement agencies don’t even report one or more hate crimes to the FBI. According to the Anti-Defamation League, at least 91 cities with populations over 100,000 people did not provide any hate crimes data or reported that there were zero hate crimes.

“Few states mandate any training for police officers on hate crimes,” Gerstenfeld said. “Some police officers have little to no training.”

Despite the challenges involved in prosecuting these cases, considering some of the details of Smollett’s reported attack, Gerstenfeld said it sounded like a “fairly straightforward case,” since the attackers were reportedly carrying chemicals and a noose, used slurs, and there didn’t appear to be any other motive.

“Where there’s premeditation and there doesn’t seem to be any other motive and there are these other pieces — like if someone burns a cross on a Black family’s front lawn or is carrying around a noose and [chemicals] — it’s hard to think of any other reasonable explanation for that,” she said.

On Wednesday evening, Anthony Guglielmi, Chicago Police Department’s chief communications officer, tweeted that “detectives located a surveillance camera showing potential persons of interest wanted for questioning” in reference to Smollett’s assault and battery.

Smollett checked into Northwestern Memorial Hospital after the attack. He is now at home recovering, his spokesman told the Los Angeles Times. He plans to make it to his scheduled performance at a West Hollywood nightclub next week.

UPDATE (1/31): April Ryan, Washington D.C. bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks, asked President Donald Trump about the reported attack on Smollett. Trump responded, “That I can tell you was horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned.”"

6:15 p.m.

A Chicago police spokesman says police will release images of people who were in the area the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett says he was attacked.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says pictures of the “persons of interest” will be released Wednesday evening. Earlier, authorities said they were expanding the search to get different angles of the attack.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi says detectives, who are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from buildings in the area.

10 a.m.

Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of footage from downtown surveillance cameras but haven’t found footage yet of the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.

The department said in a news release late Tuesday that detectives reviewed footage from privately-owned cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked and will broaden their search by reviewing footage from traffic cameras and public bus cameras.

Smollett told police he was walking downtown near the Chicago River at around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an “unknown substance” on him and put a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

“Empire” is shot in Chicago and is currently in production.

Entertainment Tonight confirmed Tuesday the 35-year-old ""Empire"" star is recovering after being attacked in what appeared to be a homophobic and racially-charged incident in Chicago.

The Chicago Police Department said the victim was walking when two unknown men approached and shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The offenders allegedly attacked the victim about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance onto him.

Police said the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck at one point during the incident before ultimately fleeing the scene.

The victim took himself to Northwestern Hospital and is in good condition.

""Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show 'Empire,'"" department rep Anthony Gulielmi said in a statement.

""Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline,"" he added.

Variety said the alleged attack took place at around 2 a.m. Tuesday morning.

Smollett arrived in Chicago Monday, according to an Instagram post, and was slated to perform in the city Saturday.

Smollett plays Jamal Lyon on ""Empire,"" which returned for a fifth season on Fox in September.

He publicly came out as gay during an episode of ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" in March 2015."

ABC affiliate WPVI reports all five attackers are free and at large. The victim was sent to the hospital for head injuries.

The assault took place in front of a gay bar in Philadelphia’s historic LBGTQ district, the Gayborhood. A bartender who witnessed it expressed worry about what this means for Philadelphia’s queer scene: “If this is happening at 13th and Walnut, I don’t know where we’re supposed to feel safe.”

And yet another attack this week, this time in our back yard. The words of our President and his supporters are fueling hatred. We must work together to make it stop. Enough is enough. https://t.co/acTjPqmY2z — NJ LGBT Dems Caucus (@NJLGBTDems) January 30, 2019

While it is not known if the victim was specifically targeted or not, this attack comes on the heels of a recent spike in violence against queer people, especially queer people of color. January 24 saw the shooting of a black trans woman in Houston. Two days earlier, news broke that Jussie Smollett of Empire fame was attacked in Chicago, a noose tied around his neck and bleach poured on him. Thankfully, nobody lost their life to these attacks.

Colorado is not immune to this kind of prejudice-motivated violence. Last May, a gay couple was non-fatally stabbed in Denver, and the attacker released on bail. State hate crime laws are inclusive of orientation, gender identity, color, and religion, but violence can still happen. The community here in Colorado needs to remain vigilant to keep ourselves safe and visible.

(CNN) Chicago police have photos of people they'd like to talk to in the case involving ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was the victim of what police are investigating as a possible hate crime.

Investigators have located a surveillance camera that shows people who are now wanted for questioning, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement on Twitter. Detectives had not yet found still images or video of the actual incident as of late Tuesday evening, police told CNN.

Camera footage doesn't capture the incident, but police want to question the two people in this image.

Smollett said he was attacked in the early morning hours on Tuesday in a Chicago neighborhood known as Streeterville by two people who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"" and ""poured an unknown chemical substance"" on him, according to police.

Smollett reported that one of his attackers also put a rope around his neck, police said. Police found video showing Smollett entering into his building with what appears to be a rope tied around his neck, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CNN.

""It was being worn like a neck tie but shaped like a noose,"" Guglielmi said.

Police detectives in Chicago investigating the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett said they found footage of “people of interest” from a surveillance camera, NBC Chicago reports. A police spokesman said the subjects seen on the video are wanted for questioning in connection with the attack early Tuesday morning.

“Police said they were planning to put out a community alert with photos from the camera at some point Wednesday evening,” the story reports.

The report adds: “Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early-morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed an attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.

“Investigators ‘for the most part’ can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows an attack, he said.”

Earlier media reports indicated the FBI was handling the investigation, but it appears the agency is mainly focused on a threatening letter received by Smollett last week. The letter was reportedly sent to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” films.

“Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area,” NBC Chicago reports. “But he said they still need to collect and view more.”

Smollett has been released from the hospital, according to media reports, and is said to be recovering from the injuries he received in the attack.

Guglielmi later released the image below on Twitter, saying it shows “people of interest” who were in the area of the attack …"

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who was reportedly the victim of a vicious attack early Tuesday morning in Chicago, turned down an offer from Fox a week earlier to provide extra security, TMZ reports.

Smollett “didn’t want to be encumbered by an entourage of bodyguards when he wasn’t working,” the story reports.

“Sources close to the situation tell us … security for the ‘Empire’ cast was increased last week after Fox Studios, in Chicago, received that threatening, homophobic letter addressed to Smollett,” TMZ reports. “We’re told Fox made the call to beef up security for everyone on set and wanted to give Jussie additional protection around the clock … but, he declined. Our sources say he made the decision to not have extra security during off-hours because it was an intrusive way of living.”

TMZ adds: “Our ‘Empire’ production sources tell us Jussie will have 24/7 armed security going forward … at least until the 2 thugs are apprehended.”

The report notes that Smollett, who sat out production on Tuesday, plans to return to the set soon, with the shooting schedule expected to be shuffled as needed."

Smollett was attacked in the early hours of Tuesday morning outside of a Chicago fast food restaurant.

After two days of outrcy on Smollett's behalf, Chicago Police were able to announce a break in the case.

Police have been canvassing the area around Smollett's alleged attack non-stop, hoping to find an exterior camera that might have caught something. At first, very little was turning up, and some reports even questioned Smollett's account.

Police told CBS News that the actor was beaten by two men in ski masks, who hollered racist and homophobic slurs at him. They dumped an unknown chemical believed to be bleach on Smollett, then wrapped a rope around his neck like a noose. Smollett later told police that the assailants shouted ""this is MAGA country"" during the attack.

Smollett's co-workers on Empire have been behind him from the beginning. The writers, producers and actors have made numerous emotional posts, wondering how or why something like this might happen. Series co-creator Lee Daniels retweeted Guglielmi's update, adding ""getting closer,"" with a rainbow and a fist emoji.

Daniels took to Instagram on Tuesday to speak out about what happened to Smollett. He referred to the actor as his ""son,"" and in a shaking voice, assured him that he did not deserve the attack.

""You are better than that. We are better than that, America is better than that,"" he said. ""It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other, regardless of what sexual orientation we are, because it shows that we are on a united front, and no racist f— can come in and do the things that they did to you.""

""Hold your head up Jussie, I'm almost there,"" he added. ""It's just another f—ing day in America.""

Smollett has yet to speak out about the attack publicly. The actor transported himself to the hospital and was released on Tuesday after being treated for minor injuries."

Nollywood actress Stella Damascus has been off the radar of the Nigerian entertainment scene for a while. Recently, however, the actress got entangled in a web of trolling by her Nigerian fans. The issue that had triggered the trolls to feast on her had everything to do with the recent Jussie Smollett saga trending for a while.

As earlier reported by Legit.ng, Bobrisky took to showing empathy to Jussie Smollett, an American gay actor known for his role in Empire, who claimed that he had been assaulted and harassed by two men. These men had thrown insults at him for being black and gay.

While efforts are being made to identify the men who had accosted the handsome actor, several people have taken to weighing in on the issue. In this regard, Stella Damascus also gave her opinion on the issue

She condemned the unnecessary attack on the actor and asserted that no one had any reason to harass him. The actress also expressed her wish that the attackers be found and punished for their offence.

""I strongly believe that ignorance is worse than illiteracy. When one is considered an illiterate in certain things, then there is hope of learning and acquiring knowledge. On the other hand when one is ignorant, they think they already know but painfully, what they think they know is so wrong and off the point.

Stella Damascus has shown that she has no free time to play around with trolls. Recently, Tonto Dikeh also took to addressing trolls who attacked her when she sympathised with and asked that the hate crime done against Jussie Smollett be avenged.

Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

Guglielmi says detectives, who are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from buildings in the area.

10 a.m.

Chicago police say they've reviewed hundreds of hours of footage from downtown surveillance cameras but haven't found footage yet of the attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett.

The department said in a news release late Tuesday that detectives reviewed footage from privately-owned cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked and will broaden their search by reviewing footage from traffic cameras and public bus cameras.

Smollett told police he was walking downtown near the Chicago River at around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an ""unknown substance"" on him and put a rope around his neck.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment.

""Empire"" is shot in Chicago and is currently in production."

5:45 PM PT -- Chicago PD have now released the screen grab of the potential suspects, showing two men wearing dark clothing. Detectives are reviewing more cameras, but are looking to question the two individuals seen in the photo. Police say the two people were seen walking near the location of the incident between 1:30 AM and 1:45 AM and are trying to determine if they witnessed the incident, or were possibly involved.

In Japanese, the characters translate to “shichirin” — a small barbecue grill.

Ariana Grande’s new tattoo “七輪” means Japanese style bbq grill, not 7 rings. 😭 If you want to know about 七輪, just google “SHICHIRIN” pic.twitter.com/HuQM2EwI62 — *amo* (@hey__amo) January 30, 2019

As the web site Kotaku notes, the kanji character “七” means “seven” and “輪” means hoop, circle or ring. When those characters are combined, however, the meaning becomes completely different.

AD

“When we translate 七輪 in English directly, it means “Seven Rings,” one Instagram user wrote. “BUT!! In Japan, the word 七輪 is used for a portable clay stove used for cooking!!!!!!!!”

AD

Grande, who has posted photos of herself studying the Japanese language in the past, acknowledged the mistake, writing in now-deleted tweets that she forgot the additional characters in the tattoo, which should’ve read “七つの指輪.”

“Indeed, I left out “つの指” which should have gone in between,” Grande wrote, using an expletive to indicate that the process was painful. “But this spot also peels a ton and won’t last so if I miss it enough I’ll suffer thru the whole thing next time.”

AD

She continued, “also.....huge fan of tiny bbq grills.”

The tattoo artist Grande tagged her in post, Kane Navasard, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon. He posted a photo of Grande’s tatted-up hand to his Instagram on Tuesday and tagged the singer, writing, “If you didn’t know, @arianagrande is a G.”

AD

Ironically, the correct Japanese translation of “7 Rings” can be seen at the 12-second mark in the song’s music video. A photo of the misspelled hand tattoo was still published to Grande’s official Japanese Twitter account late Wednesday afternoon:

Grande later tried to correct her tattoo, but wound up complicating things further. BuzzFeed reported that Grande posted a text exchange with her Japanese tutor on Instagram in which the tutor explained which kanji characters and placement would fix the error. The post now appears to be deleted.

AD

In an Instagram Story posted early Thursday, Grande showed off a revised tattoo. “Slightly better,” she wrote. “Thanks to my tutor for helping me fix.” Except, it wasn’t better.

A BuzzFeed Japan reporter was quick to point out that the new, incorrect placement of the additional kanji characters actually made it read “Japanese BBQ finger.”

AD

Why... how... now Ariana’s tattoo reads “Japanese BBQ finger” 💅 pic.twitter.com/zC2LxSKJtI — Eimi Yamamitsu | 山光瑛美 (@eimiyamamitsu) January 31, 2019

As Kotaku reported, because characters are sometimes read top to bottom and right to left, adding the new kanji character beneath the existing “七” would make the tattoo translate into nonsense. BuzzFeed explains that if read left to right instead, it would translate into ""charcoal BBQ grill finger ♡”.

Grande’s Instagram caption concluded: “R.I.P. tiny charcoal grill. Miss u man. I actually really liked it.”

Theo Wargo/Getty Images(CHICAGO) — Chicago police announced they have located surveillance video showing potential persons of interest in an alleged attack on “Empire” actor and singer Jussie Smollett.

Investigators are looking to question the men seen in the video, which was found Wednesday, Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi announced on Twitter.

A Chicago Police spokesperson told ABC News the video shows two people walking in the general area of where Smollett was at the time of the attack. The video does not show the assault, the spokesperson said.

The department plans on sending an alert out to the community asking if the public recognizes the two unknown people, but the quality of the video is not great, the spokesperson said.

Police are continuing to investigate and search for the two men allegedly involved in what they call “a potential racially-charged hate crime” against Smollett.

The brutal attack against the “Empire” star took place around 2 a.m. Tuesday and the 36-year-old actor was subsequently hospitalized and released, local authorities said. Smollett has been cooperating with local authorities to find the men he says attacked him, shouting racial and homophobic slurs at him in the process.

In addition to being attacked, Smollett told police Tuesday that the men also poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck. The rope was still around Smollett’s neck when he was found, officials said.

“As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, detectives canvassed and reviewed hundreds of hours of video and have now expanded the search area along the Chicago riverfront, hoping to find video to be able to release a public description of the offenders,” a Chicago Police Department spokesperson told ABC News early Wednesday.

“Unfortunately, thus far we have not found any helpful information on a suspect or a suspect’s vehicle to be able to share.”

“We are taking this investigation very seriously and detective teams will broaden our search area and work around the clock to look for video on traffic cameras, CTA buses and neighboring thoroughfares which could have captured the offender’s movements,” the police spokesperson added, referring to the Chicago Transit Authority. “The victim in this case is cooperating fully with detectives and our investigation continues.”

On Tuesday, an earlier alleged threat to Smollett, in the form of a letter, drawing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into a probe of the letter threat, the spokesman confirmed to ABC News.

The letter allegedly threatening Smollett before the attack was sent to the Fox television studio in Chicago on Jan. 22, police said. The letter contained threatening language and was laced with a powdery substance that investigators believe was likely just crushed-up Tylenol.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” on Wednesday, “Empire” co-star Terrence Howard said a production manager notified the cast about the attack in a meeting on set Tuesday.

“Jaws dropped to the ground,” Howard said, recalling the emergency cast meeting. “And then when we learned that there had been letters sent to Fox as threats about the potential for something like this and then we became much more frightened.”

“As far as I know, for 17 hours a day, Jussie Smollett is my son,” Howard said. “So you’re feeling this helplessness, this hopelessness that your children — the people that you love — aren’t safe,” he added.

The actor said Fox boosted security on set in the wake of the incident and offered each cast member 24-hour personal security.

“It was offered up today that we could have 24-hour security. Someone parked in front of our house during the evening, someone to drive us, or to follow us to and from work,” Howard told “GMA.”

Other members of the “Empire” family like creator Lee Daniels and co-star Vivica A. Fox spoke out in disgust over the attack and said they will be right by his side.

Smollett’s “Empire” character, Jamal, is the son of a hip-hop mogul who initially has trouble accepting that Jamal is gay.

After hitting it big in “Empire,” Smollett said he likes to stay away from talking about his personal life, but he did. make reference to his sexual identify — which has prompted industry chatter.

“There’s never been a closet that I’ve been in,” he said. “There is, without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in, and I just wanted to make that clear.”

In previous interviews, Smollett wouldn’t talk about his sexuality but did say fans and others shouldn’t try to fit him into any box.

Smollett, a cast member on the popular TV show filmed at a studio on the West Side, claims two masked men physically beat him up at 2 a.m. while hurling racial and homophobic slurs.

Even worse, the actor, who is openly gay, says his attackers threw an unknown liquid on him and put a rope around his neck.

According to the actor, the assailants yelled, “This is MAGA country,” during the assault.

Smollett was able to take himself to a friend’s apartment where police were called about 40 minutes later. When officers arrived, Smollett still had the rope around his neck, and was still wearing the shirt splattered with the unidentified substance.

Wednesday evening, police said surveillance images show “two persons of interest” in the reported homophobic and racist attack.

The incident sounds so bizarre, it is easy to doubt it happened.

But far worse hate crimes have happened in recent years.

Who would have thought that a young white man would walk into a black church in Charleston and kill nine people during Bible study, as Dylann Roof did in 2015?

Last week, a 30-year-old white supremacist named James Harris Jackson pleaded guilty to the 2017 stabbing death of Timothy Caughman, an African-American. Jackson told the court he believed the killing would “spark a nationwide race war,” the Associated Press reported.

The reported attack on Smollett included every hateful element you could think of: racism, homophobia, lynching and Trumpism.

In response, there has been an outpouring of support for Smollett from Hollywood entertainers who expressed outrage that something so virulent could happen to him because he is black and gay.

U.S. Congressman Bobby L. Rush, D-Ill., has demanded that a federal investigation be launched and used the opportunity to urge fellow legislators to support his proposed “Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act.”

In a city where teenagers are routinely carjacking vehicles at gunpoint and robbing people of their possessions in broad daylight, it isn’t hard to believe that Smollett got beat up while walking alone at 2 a.m.

But the alleged hate crime puts a spotlight on a growing problem.

According to a recent FBI report, the numbers of hate crimes reported in the U.S. increased by 17 percent in 2017.

There is a lot of interest in this incident –– not only because of who Smollett is –– but because racism and homophobia are involved.

Frankly, the media and the public react strongly when violence involves allegations of a hate crime compared to the gun violence that takes place on our streets every day.

For example, in 2016, when Chicago was practically in a state of emergency because of skyrocketing homicides, the attack on a white teen with mental disabilities by four young African-Americans was an international scandal.

One of the attackers livestreamed the others beating and racially taunting the victim with demands that he denounce Trump and say, “I love black people.”

Three co-defendants got prison sentences after pleading guilty to hate crime and kidnapping charges. After spending more than a year in jail before reaching a plea deal, the woman who livestreamed the attack on Facebook Live got probation.

On the day that Smollett was beaten in Streeterville, three people were wounded in shootings, including a 67-year-old man who was shot in the back of the head while sitting inside a home.

A 33-year-old man was shot while shoveling snow in the Scottsdale area, and a 21 year-old man was wounded in Bronzeville. On the West Side, an argument between two men ended with one being shot three times.

These days, gun violence rarely warrants more than a mention.

As for Smollett’s trauma, police are still trying to corroborate his story.

But after this, he might want to rethink walking to Subway alone in the wee hours.

This might not be “MAGA country,” but Chicago has proven itself to be a violent city."

At the urging of the police, Smollett was taken to a hospital for lacerations on his face and neck, and was treated and released.

In a second interview with the police Tuesday, Smollett said that one of the men yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

Initially, the police had been stymied, finding nothing useful on surveillance video despite the fact that the neighborhood, Streeterville, filled with office buildings, hotels and luxury apartments, had a “very high density” of cameras. Then, on Wednesday, the police announced they had “located a surveillance camera that shows potential persons of interest wanted for questioning.”

“While the video footage does not depict an assault, the individuals pictured are seen in the vicinity of the alleged criminal incident during the alleged time of occurrence,” the police statement said."

“Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted. “While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.”

Smollett was attacked at around 2 a.m. Tuesday in the city’s Streeterville neighborhood when he said two people began yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him. The “Empire” star told police that the attackers also yelled about “MAGA.”

In a statement Tuesday, Chicago PD said a “cast member from the Fox series ‘Empire’ was injured in what police called a ‘possible racially-charged assault and battery.'”

Police said Smollett then drove himself to Northwestern Hospital, where he was in good condition, a person with knowledge of the situation told TheWrap Tuesday evening.

Chicago police officer Michelle Tannehill told TheWrap that Smollett did not initially mention the attackers shouting about MAGA — an abbreviation of President Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan — but did bring up “MAGA” in a follow-up interview.

“When detectives followed up later in the day, he recalled the attackers making those remarks,” Tannehill said. She said she could not be more specific.

The case has brought an outpouring of love for Smollett and widespread condemnation of the attack. Some online have objected to the word “possible,” saying the hateful element of such a crime is obvious. But Tannehill said police routinely use the word “possible” in cases when the an investigation is not yet complete.

Smollett told Ellen DeGeneres on her show in 2015 that “there is without a doubt, no closet that I’ve ever been in, and I just wanted to make that clear.”

On “Empire,” he plays Jamal Lyon, a gay musician. Executive producer Danny Strong condemned the attack on Twitter on Tuesday, saying the “terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society.”

According to the Chicago Police Department's incident details, a 30-something man was walking when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him. Police say the offenders allegedly began to attack the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance onto the victim.

At some point during the alleged incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck. According to police, the offenders then fled the scene, and the victim was self-transported to Northwestern Hospital. He is in good condition, and Area Central Detectives are investigating.

Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi sent out a statement to ET on Tuesday reading: ""Overnight, the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially-charged assault and battery involving a cast member of the television show Empire. Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline. The victim is fully cooperating with investigators and we ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Area Central Detectives at 312-747-8382 or report it anonymously to www.cpdtip.com .""

According to TMZ , the attack happened at around 2 a.m. when Smollett went out to get a sandwich, after which someone yelled, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" The outlet reports that the the two offenders -- who allegedly are white and wore ski masks -- beat Smollett badly enough to fracture a rib, then tied a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him.

""This is MAGA country,"" TMZ reports the offenders yelled as they fled after the assault.

ThatGrapeJuice.Net , who was first to report the news, also published an alleged note Smollett received prior to the attack, which threatens him and contains a homophobic slur.

ET has reached out to Smollett's rep.

A spokesperson for GLAAD tells ET that they've reached out to the 35-year-old actor for support.

“GLAAD reached out to FOX and Jussie’s team today to offer assistance as well as support for him,"" the statement reads. ""Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world.”

Smollett appeared to be in good spirits as late as Monday, when he Instagrammed his arrival in Chicago.

""#Mood after spending 7 hours on a plane for a 2 hour flight but finally landing all good,"" he wrote alongside a smiling picture of himself. ""Love y’all. Goodnight #WinterVortexIsHurr #ChicagoWeatherAintNoJoke #Smile #troubadourFeb2 #Freedom.""

The lead comes after detectives spent hours screening surveillance tapes for clues.

Police sources said it is unclear what may have transpired but 12 detectives on the case are trying to identify the individuals picked up by the cameras and want to question them. Police released images of the individuals Wednesday night.

A gay cast member of the Fox hit show ""Empire,"" the actor told police two white men shouting racial epithets and gay slurs beat him up, doused him with an unknown chemical and tied a rope around his neck after he left a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. The rope was still on his neck when the police first arrived 45 minutes after being alerted.

Sources said the video that identifies the persons of interest also shows Smollett with a rope around his neck. Smollett told police the attackers also allegedly yelled, ""this is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Trump's campaign slogan.

His account prompted a wave of support from the worlds of entertainment and politics. Police said Smollett has been cooperative and took them on a walk-through of the area in question."

But in America, the occurrence of racist, homophobic hate crime should come as no shock.

In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation—which, as ABC News reported on Tuesday evening, is now assisting in the investigation into an earlier threat allegedly made against Smollett by mail—has seen a recent increase in reports of hate crimes that were motivated by a victim’s actual or perceived sexual orientation.

As the New York City Anti-Violence Project noted in a statement as the news about Smollett broke, “gay black men are some of the most vulnerable to violence in the LGBTQ community.”

The 36-year-old actor and singer, who came out to Ellen DeGeneres in 2015, told Chicago police early Tuesday morning that two assailants hit him in the face while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, poured an “unknown substance” on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck.

Smollett had just arrived in Chicago from New York to film Empire and said he had gone to Subway for a late-night bite before the attack took place.

The police initially told reporters that they were not aware of the phrase “MAGA country” being shouted by Smollett's assailants, as TMZ had originally reported. Smollett said in a follow-up police interview that his attackers had indeed shouted the phrase.

Chicago police are investigating the Smollett incident as a “possible hate crime.” On Wednesday, a spokesperson revealed, via Twitter, that “detectives located a surveillance camera that shows potential persons of interest wanted for questioning in reference to the assault & battery of Empire actor. A community alert w/ photos is being constructed and will be disseminated shortly.”

In the wave of emotional reactions to the alleged assault on social media, a debate arose about whether Chicago qualified as “MAGA country”—but the truth is that violent attacks on LGBT people, especially LGBT people of color, are all not uncommon in this country, whether it’s a “MAGA” region or not.

In 2017, the FBI counted 1,303 offenses reported by law enforcement agencies to have been motivated by sexual-orientation bias. That was an increase from 1,218 such offenses in 2016 and a comparable 1,219 offenses the year before.

2014 saw even fewer: 1,178. In fact, the most recent year to have had more of these reported offenses than 2017 was 2013, when the FBI count stood at 1,402.

It’s hard to say definitively whether the actual number of these offenses is on the rise because, as the Human Rights Campaign recently noted, reporting hate crimes to the FBI is not mandatory and the data is therefore incomplete.

The HRC also observed—citing 2017 FBI data—that hate crimes targeting black people made up 28 percent of all such offenses. In 2017, that amounted to 2,358 offenses—the highest number out of any type of reported hate crime that year.

In total, hate crimes rose in 2017 by 17 per cent (from 6.121 attacks in 2016 to 7,175 in 2017), with 2,013 aimed at African-Americans and 938 against Jewish Americans.

“ There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities—and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities ”

“Nearly three out of five hate crimes were motivated by race and ethnicity,” the New York Times reported. “Religion and sexual orientation were the other two primary motivators.”

“This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident,” HRC President Chad Griffin said in a statement. “There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities—and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities.”

Every day, on average, there are at least three reported offenses motivated by homophobia or biphobia—not to mention the violent crimes against transgender people as well as offenses that go unreported.

It’s sadly not challenging to find incidents of horrific violence against LGBT people in the United States—nor are they confined to so-called “MAGA” country, as reported attacks in places like New York City and Seattle prove.

In 2017, to cite one example, a 29-year-old Mississippi man was sentenced to nearly 50 years in prison for killing a young transgender woman named Mercedes Williamson.

As the Department of Justice noted in a press release, the man shocked her with a stun gun, stabbed her multiple times, hit her with a hammer, and then tried to claim that he had murdered her “in a panic” upon discovering that she was transgender—even though he had long been aware of that fact.

Smollett's attack has received widespread publicity due to his fame, while the shooting of a black trans woman known as Pinky in Houston, Texas, as reported by Monica Roberts' TransGriot blog, has received considerably less.

In 2016, an Atlanta man was sentenced to 40 years in prison for pouring a pot of boiling water over two gay men as they slept together in bed. (“It was just a little hot water,” the man was reported to have said.) As the Washington Post reported, he could not be charged with a hate crime because Georgia has no hate crimes law.

By contrast, the state of Illinois, where Smollett reported his attack, has a hate crimes law that covers both sexual orientation and gender identity—one of 18 states to have such legislation in place, along with the District of Columbia.

According to the Movement Advancement Project, which tracks this legislation, 12 states have hate crimes laws that include sexual orientation but not gender identity, while an additional 20 states do not cover either category or have no hate crimes law.

That means it is often only possible to prosecute anti-LGBT hate crimes as such under federal law—specifically the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The Williamson murder, for example, was the first successful use of the Shepard-Byrd Act in history to prosecute a crime targeting a transgender victim.

Even then, the Shepard-Byrd Act is an imperfect tool. As the Associated Press recently reported in a 20-year-retrospective on the legislation, the federal law has produced relatively few convictions in crimes with LGBT victims. The impact of the legislation, as groups like Lambda Legal and the HRC told the AP, can be measured mostly in its ripple effects on state and local enforcement—and through its symbolic impact on our culture.

As news of the alleged assault spread across social media, lawmakers joined in the Twitter reaction—but few offered concrete proposals to help curb anti-LGBT violence. Former Vice President Joe Biden said that “homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts.” Congresswoman Maxine Waters called for the “culprits” to be brought “to justice.” House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi asked that “we all commit to ending this hate once and for all.”

Democratic Senator Cory Booker and 2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris both renewed their calls to supplement the Shepard-Byrd Act with a law that specifically criminalizes lynching, as The Advocate reported.

On Twitter, both senators called the Smollett attack an “attempted modern-day lynching.” Their bill passed the Senate in December by a unanimous vote but did not have time to go to a vote before the House by the end of the 2018 legislative session and so far has not been taken up again.

“ As MediaMatters noted, many “MAGA” accounts on social media have been theorizing that the attack was a hoax, thereby affecting social media search algorithms for those looking for further information on the story ”

President Donald Trump, who promised in his 2016 acceptance speech to “do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens,” has not tweeted about the alleged attack—but has tweeted about caravans and the border wall.

As MediaMatters noted, many “MAGA” accounts on social media have been theorizing that the attack was a hoax, thereby affecting social media search algorithms for those looking for further information on the story.

Meanwhile, as LGBT advocates have long observed, there are concrete steps that could help reduce anti-LGBT hate crimes in the United States, like Congress making reporting mandatory for local law enforcement agencies, state legislatures passing LGBT-inclusive hate crimes laws if they don’t have them already, or local police departments working to gain the trust of the LGBT community so they feel more comfortable reporting.

It’s clear that the the Jussie Smollett attack has had a tremendous emotional impact; whether that impact translates into remedial political action remains to be seen."
